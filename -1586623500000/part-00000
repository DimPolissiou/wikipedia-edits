G. Ravichandar. The film features [[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]], making it his 25th project as an actor and [[Nandita]] in the leading roles, while [[Simon (music director)|Simon]] composes the film's music. The film was released on 22 August 2014 to mixed reviews. The film was later dubbed into [[Hindi language|Hindi]] as ''ATM'' by Goldmines Telefilms in 2017.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIO3abe1jUk</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie starts of with Sigamani ([[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]]) as a young student refusing to go to school. His father, after having heated arguments with the school teacher, says his son does not have to go to school. Thus, Sigamani grows up illiterate and uneducated. After 25 years, he has grown up to be a siddha vaithiyar, following his family's roots. There is also a marriage broker in this story, Vijay Sethupathy ([[Singampuli]]), who tries hard to find an educated girl for Sigamani, but he is unable to. Due to the fact that Sigamani is uneducated, he is easily cheated by his friends. His only trustable friend is Paalpandi ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]). In desperation to marry an educated girl, Sigamani plans to wait outside a college to find a girl to love. He then sees Nandini ([[Nandita]]) and decides to go after her. One day, Sigamani and Paalpandi follow Nandini and end up in her house. After listening to an unknown phone call, Nandini's father Chinnadurai ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) mistakes Sigamani to be a doctor who has studied MBBS and arranges for the marriage, which also takes place successfully and Sigamani is happy as his dream of marrying an educated girl has come true.

The Synod exercised direct authority over Russian parishes in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Far East. \n\nIn North America, however, a conflict developed among bishops who did not recognize the authority of the Synod, led by Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky); this group formed the [[Orthodox Church in America|American Metropolia]], the predecessor to the [[Orthodox Church in America|OCA]]. Likewise, in Western Europe, Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgievsky)]], based in [[Paris]] from late 1922, did not recognise the Synod as having more than \"a moral authority.\" Metropolitan Eulogius later broke off and in February 1931 joined the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This formed the [[Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe|Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe]].\n\nOn 5 September 1927, the Council of Bishops in Sremski Karlovci, presided over by Metropolitan Anthony, decreed a formal break of liaison with the \u2033Moscow church authority.\u2033 They rejected a demand by Metropolitan [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Sergius (Stragorodsky)]] of Nizhny Novgorod, who was acting on behalf of Locum Tenens (Metropolitan [[Peter of Krutitsy]], imprisoned then in the Soviet [[Gulag]], where he later died), to declare political loyalty to the Soviet authorities.

In early September 1943, [[Joseph Stalin]] met at the Kremlin with a group of three surviving ROC metropolitans headed by [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Sergius (Stragorodsky)]]. He allowed the Moscow Patriarchate to convene a council and elect a Patriarch, open theological schools, and re-open (keep open) a few major monasteries and some churches (most of which had been re-opened in territory [[German-occupied Europe|occupied by Germany]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Orthodox Church in the History of Russia|author=Pospielovsky, Dimitry|year=1998|publisher=St. Vladimir\u2019s Seminary Press|location=Crestwood, NY}}</ref> The Soviet government decisively sided with the Moscow Patriarchate, while the so-called ''[[Living Church|Obnovlentsi]]'' (modernising pro-Soviet current in the ROC), previously favoured by the authorities, were sidelined; their proponents were disappeared shortly after.

A distinction must be made between the various opinions of bishops, clergy, and laity within ROCOR, and official statements from the Synod of Bishops.  There was a general belief in ROCOR that the Soviet government was manipulating the Moscow Patriarchate to one extent or another, and that under such circumstances administrative ties were impossible.  There were also official statements made that the elections of the patriarchs of Moscow which occurred after 1927 were invalid because they were not conducted freely (without the interference of the Soviets) or with the participation of the entire Russian Church.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.stvladimirs.ca/library/concerning-patriarch-pimen.html Resolution of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia Concerning the Election of Pimen (Isvekov) as Patriarch of Moscow, September 1/14) 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329204753/http://www.stvladimirs.ca/library/concerning-patriarch-pimen.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, December 27th, 2007</ref>  However, these statements only declared that ROCOR did not recognize the Patriarchs of Moscow who were elected after 1927 as being the legitimate primates of the Russian Church\u2014they did not declare that the Bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate were illegitimate bishops, or without grace.  There were, however, under the umbrella of this general consensus, various opinions about the Moscow Patriarchate, ranging for those who held the extreme view that the Moscow Patriarchate had apostatized from the Church (those in the orbit of Holy Transfiguration Monastery being the most vocal advocates of this position), to those who considered them to be innocent sufferers at the hands of the Soviets, and all points in between.  Advocates of the more extreme view of the Moscow Patriarchate became increasingly strident in the 1970s, at a time when ROCOR was increasingly isolating itself from much of the rest of the Orthodox Church due to concerns over the direction of Orthodox involvement in the Ecumenical Movement. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, there wasn't a burning need to settle the question of what should be made of the status of the Moscow Patriarchate, although beginning in the mid-1980s (as the period of [[glasnost]] began in the Soviet Union, which culminated in the ultimate collapse of the Soviet government in 1991), these questions resulted in a number of schisms, and increasingly occupied the attention of those in ROCOR.\n\nThere are certain basic facts about the official position of ROCOR that should be understood.  Historically, ROCOR has always affirmed that it was an inseparable part of the Russian Church, and that its autonomous status was only temporary, based upon [http://orthodoxwiki.org/Ukaz_No._362 Ukaz 362], until such time as the domination of the Soviet government over the affairs of the Church should cease:\n\n:\"The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia is an indissoluble part of the Russian Orthodox Church, and for the time until the extermination in Russia of the atheist government, is self-governing on conciliar principles in accordance with the resolution of the Patriarch, the Most Holy Synod, and the Highest Church Council [Sobor] of the Russian Church dated 7/20 November 1920, No. 362.\"<ref>[http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/pages/regulations/rocorregulations.html Regulations Of The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, Confirmed by the Council of Bishops in 1956 and by a decision of the Council dated 5/18 June, 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330054108/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/pages/regulations/rocorregulations.html |date=2009-03-30 }}, first paragraph, December 28, 2007</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Metropolitan [[Anastassy (Gribanovsky)]] wrote in his Last Will and Testament:\n\n:\"As regards the Moscow Patriarchate and its hierarchs, then, so long as they continue in close, active and benevolent cooperation with the Soviet Government, which openly professes its complete godlessness and strives to implant atheism in the entire Russian nation, then the Church Abroad, maintaining Her purity, must not have any canonical, liturgical or even simply external communion with them whatsoever, leaving each one of them at the same time to the final judgment of the Council (Sobor) of the future free Russian Church.\"<ref>[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/anastasy-will.html The last will and testament of Metropolitan Anastassy, 1957], December 28, 2007</ref>\n\nROCOR viewed the Russian Church as consisting of three parts during the Soviet period: 1. The Moscow Patriarchate, 2. the Catacomb Church, and 3. The Free Russian Church (ROCOR).  The Catacomb Church had been a significant part of the Russian Church prior to World War II.  Most of those in ROCOR had left Russia during or well before World War II.  They were unaware of the changes that had occurred immediately after World War II&mdash;most significantly that with the election of Patriarch [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Alexei I]], most of the Catacomb Church was reconciled with the Moscow Patriarchate.  By the 1970s, due to this reconciliation, as well as to continued persecution by the Soviets, there was very little left of the Catacomb Church.  [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] made this point in a letter to the 1974 [http://orthodoxwiki.org/All-Diaspora_Councils All-Diaspora Sobor] of ROCOR, in which he stated that ROCOR should not \"show solidarity with a mysterious, sinless, but also bodiless catacomb.\"<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/cat_1974.aspx The Catacomb Tikhonite Church 1974], The Orthodox Word, Nov.-Dec., 1974 (59), 235-246, December 28, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Movement toward reconciliation with the Moscow Patriarchate==\nIn 2000 Metropolitan Laurus became the First Hierarch of the ROCOR; he expressed interest in the idea of reunification.

The Muscovite letter said that previous and current separation of the religious groups were purely political matters.

This was more friendly a discourse than in previous decades.\n\nIn 2003 President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia met with Metropolitan Laurus in New York.

Shortly thereafter, Patriarch Alexey II entered the Cathedral.  After the Patriarch read the prayer for the unity of the Russian Church, the Act of Canonical Communion was read aloud, and two copies were each signed by both Metropolitan Laurus and Patriarch Alexey II. The two hierarchs exchanged the \"kiss of peace,\" and they and the entire Russian Church sang \"God Grant You Many Years.\"  Following this, the Divine Liturgy of the Feast of the Ascension of Our Lord began, culminating with the entirety of the bishops of both ROCOR and MP partaking of the Eucharist.\n\nPresent at all of this was Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], who was thanked by Patriarch Alexey for helping to facilitate the reconciliation. Putin addressed the audience of Orthodox Christians, visitors, clergy, and press, saying, \n<blockquote>\"The split in the church was caused by an extremely deep political split within Russian society itself.

In the beginning, this was a result of some of the Russian bishops having lost regular liaison with the central church authority in [[Moscow]] due to the [[Russian Civil War]] and their subsequent exile. They migrated with other Russians to Europe, including Paris and other parts of France, and to the United States and other western countries. Later these bishops rejected the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]]\u2032s unconditional political loyalty to the [[Bolshevik]] regime in the [[USSR]]. This was formally promulgated by the ''Declaration of 20 July 1927'' of Metropolitan [[Sergius I of Moscow|Sergius (Stragorodsky)]], deputy [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarchal]] [[locum tenens]]. Metropolitan [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)]], of [[Eparchy of Kiev (Moscow Patriarchate)|Kiev and Galicia]], was the founding First Hierarch of the ROCOR.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burlacioiu|first=Ciprian|date=April 2018|title=Russian Orthodox Diaspora as a Global Religion after 1918|journal=Studies in World Christianity|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=4\u201324|doi=10.3366/swc.2018.0202|issn=1354-9901}}</ref>\n\nAfter 80 years of separation and the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], on 17 May 2007 the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia officially signed the [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate]], restoring the canonical link between the churches.

On 7 November (20 November) 1920, [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow|Tikhon]], [[Patriarch of Moscow]], his Synod, and the Supreme Church Council in Moscow issued a joint resolution, No. 362, instructing all Russian Orthodox Christian bishops, should they be unable to maintain liaison with the Supreme Church Administration in Moscow, to seek protection and guidance by organizing among themselves. The resolution effectively legitimised the Temporary Higher Church Administration; it served as the legal basis for the eventual establishment of a completely independent church body.<ref>[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/28517.html \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439]: \u2033\u041f\u0440. 1. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438, \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0434\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0421\u0432. \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430, \u0421\u0432. \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u0442 7/20 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 1920 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u2116 362.

The Synod exercised direct authority over Russian parishes in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Far East. \n\nIn North America, however, a conflict developed among bishops who did not recognize the authority of the Synod, led by Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky); this group formed the [[Orthodox Church in America|American Metropolia]], the predecessor to the [[Orthodox Church in America|OCA]]. Likewise, in Western Europe, Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgievsky)]], based in [[Paris]] from late 1922, did not recognise the Synod as having more than \"a moral authority.\" Metropolitan Eulogius later broke off and in February 1931 joined the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This formed the [[Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe|Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe]].\n\nOn 5 September 1927, the Council of Bishops in Sremski Karlovci, presided over by Metropolitan Anthony, decreed a formal break of liaison with the \u2033Moscow church authority.\u2033 They rejected a demand by Metropolitan [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Sergius (Stragorodsky)]] of Nizhny Novgorod, who was acting on behalf of Locum Tenens (Metropolitan [[Peter of Krutitsy]], imprisoned then in the Soviet [[Gulag]], where he later died), to declare political loyalty to the Soviet authorities.

He allowed the Moscow Patriarchate to convene a council and elect a Patriarch, open theological schools, and re-open (keep open) a few major monasteries and some churches (most of which had been re-opened in territory [[German-occupied Europe|occupied by Germany]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Orthodox Church in the History of Russia|author=Pospielovsky, Dimitry|year=1998|publisher=St. Vladimir\u2019s Seminary Press|location=Crestwood, NY}}</ref> The Soviet government decisively sided with the Moscow Patriarchate, while the so-called ''[[Living Church|Obnovlentsi]]'' (modernising pro-Soviet current in the ROC), previously favoured by the authorities, were sidelined; their proponents were disappeared shortly after.

A distinction must be made between the various opinions of bishops, clergy, and laity within ROCOR, and official statements from the Synod of Bishops.  There was a general belief in ROCOR that the Soviet government was manipulating the Moscow Patriarchate to one extent or another, and that under such circumstances administrative ties were impossible.  There were also official statements made that the elections of the patriarchs of Moscow which occurred after 1927 were invalid because they were not conducted freely (without the interference of the Soviets) or with the participation of the entire Russian Church.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.stvladimirs.ca/library/concerning-patriarch-pimen.html Resolution of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia Concerning the Election of Pimen (Isvekov) as Patriarch of Moscow, September 1/14) 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329204753/http://www.stvladimirs.ca/library/concerning-patriarch-pimen.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, December 27th, 2007</ref>  However, these statements only declared that ROCOR did not recognize the Patriarchs of Moscow who were elected after 1927 as being the legitimate primates of the Russian Church\u2014they did not declare that the Bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate were illegitimate bishops, or without grace.  There were, however, under the umbrella of this general consensus, various opinions about the Moscow Patriarchate, ranging for those who held the extreme view that the Moscow Patriarchate had apostatized from the Church (those in the orbit of Holy Transfiguration Monastery being the most vocal advocates of this position), to those who considered them to be innocent sufferers at the hands of the Soviets, and all points in between.  Advocates of the more extreme view of the Moscow Patriarchate became increasingly strident in the 1970s, at a time when ROCOR was increasingly isolating itself from much of the rest of the Orthodox Church due to concerns over the direction of Orthodox involvement in the Ecumenical Movement. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, there wasn't a burning need to settle the question of what should be made of the status of the Moscow Patriarchate, although beginning in the mid-1980s (as the period of [[glasnost]] began in the Soviet Union, which culminated in the ultimate collapse of the Soviet government in 1991), these questions resulted in a number of schisms, and increasingly occupied the attention of those in ROCOR.\n\nThere are certain basic facts about the official position of ROCOR that should be understood.  Historically, ROCOR has always affirmed that it was an inseparable part of the Russian Church, and that its autonomous status was only temporary, based upon [http://orthodoxwiki.org/Ukaz_No._362 Ukaz 362], until such time as the domination of the Soviet government over the affairs of the Church should cease:\n\n:\"The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia is an indissoluble part of the Russian Orthodox Church, and for the time until the extermination in Russia of the atheist government, is self-governing on conciliar principles in accordance with the resolution of the Patriarch, the Most Holy Synod, and the Highest Church Council [Sobor] of the Russian Church dated 7/20 November 1920, No. 362.\"<ref>[http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/pages/regulations/rocorregulations.html Regulations Of The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, Confirmed by the Council of Bishops in 1956 and by a decision of the Council dated 5/18 June, 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330054108/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/pages/regulations/rocorregulations.html |date=2009-03-30 }}, first paragraph, December 28, 2007</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Metropolitan [[Anastassy (Gribanovsky)]] wrote in his Last Will and Testament:\n\n:\"As regards the Moscow Patriarchate and its hierarchs, then, so long as they continue in close, active and benevolent cooperation with the Soviet Government, which openly professes its complete godlessness and strives to implant atheism in the entire Russian nation, then the Church Abroad, maintaining Her purity, must not have any canonical, liturgical or even simply external communion with them whatsoever, leaving each one of them at the same time to the final judgment of the Council (Sobor) of the future free Russian Church.\"<ref>[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/anastasy-will.html The last will and testament of Metropolitan Anastassy, 1957], December 28, 2007</ref>\n\nROCOR viewed the Russian Church as consisting of three parts during the Soviet period: 1. The Moscow Patriarchate, 2. the Catacomb Church, and 3. The Free Russian Church (ROCOR).  The Catacomb Church had been a significant part of the Russian Church prior to World War II.  Most of those in ROCOR had left Russia during or well before World War II.  They were unaware of the changes that had occurred immediately after World War II&mdash;most significantly that with the election of Patriarch [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Alexei I]], most of the Catacomb Church was reconciled with the Moscow Patriarchate.  By the 1970s, due to this reconciliation, as well as to continued persecution by the Soviets, there was very little left of the Catacomb Church.  [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] made this point in a letter to the 1974 [http://orthodoxwiki.org/All-Diaspora_Councils All-Diaspora Sobor] of ROCOR, in which he stated that ROCOR should not \"show solidarity with a mysterious, sinless, but also bodiless catacomb.\"<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/cat_1974.aspx The Catacomb Tikhonite Church 1974], The Orthodox Word, Nov.-Dec., 1974 (59), 235-246, December 28, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Movement toward reconciliation with the Moscow Patriarchate==\nIn 2000 Metropolitan Laurus became the First Hierarch of the ROCOR; he expressed interest in the idea of reunification.

The Muscovite letter said that previous and current separation of the religious groups were purely political matters.

This was more friendly a discourse than in previous decades.\n\nIn 2003 President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia met with Metropolitan Laurus in New York.

Shortly thereafter, Patriarch Alexey II entered the Cathedral.  After the Patriarch read the prayer for the unity of the Russian Church, the Act of Canonical Communion was read aloud, and two copies were each signed by both Metropolitan Laurus and Patriarch Alexey II. The two hierarchs exchanged the \"kiss of peace,\" and they and the entire Russian Church sang \"God Grant You Many Years.\"  Following this, the Divine Liturgy of the Feast of the Ascension of Our Lord began, culminating with the entirety of the bishops of both ROCOR and MP partaking of the Eucharist.\n\nPresent at all of this was Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], who was thanked by Patriarch Alexey for helping to facilitate the reconciliation.
