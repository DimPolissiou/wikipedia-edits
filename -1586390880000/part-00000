The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10-11 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, The French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520). <ref> This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) </ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.  With he exception of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], English Cathedrals show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.\n<!---\n==Background== \n===Historical=== \n*Edward the Confessor fostered monasticism and founds Westminster Abbey\n*1066 and all that.

(A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''(1922). pp. 35-45</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. \n35-45</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' pp. 35-45 </ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174-1184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176-1450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220-1235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220-1258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220-1258)\n</gallery>\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n \n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals. <ref>Bechmann (2017), page=295</ref>  \n\n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith )1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n\n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]]) surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns. <ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185-1311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220-1258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225-1240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n==Decorated Gothic {{anchor|Decorated Gothic|Geometric Decorated}} (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10-11 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, The French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520). <ref> This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) </ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.

(A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''(1922). pp. 35-45</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. \n35-45</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' pp. 35-45 </ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174-1184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176-1450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220-1235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220-1258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220-1258)\n</gallery>\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n \n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals. <ref>Bechmann (2017), page=295</ref>  \n\n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith )1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n\n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]]) surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns. <ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185-1311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220-1258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225-1240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n==Decorated Gothic {{anchor|Decorated Gothic}} (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s. The style was [[Geometry|geometrical]] at first and [[curvilinear]], or curving and serpentine, in the later period,  This curvilinear element was introduced in the first quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.<ref name=\"EB1911DP\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Decorated Period|volume=7|page=915|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref>. A notable example of the curvilinear style is the East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], (about 1350).\n\n* '''Sculpture''' also became more ornate and decorative. The [[ball flower]] and a four-leaved flower motif took the place of the earlier [[dog-tooth]]. The foliage in the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] was less conventional than in Early English and more flowing, Another decorative feature of the period was [[diapering]], or creating multicolour geometric patterns on walls or panels made with different colours of stone or brick.  <ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n===Notable examples===\n*[[Lincoln Cathedral]] (west facade and Angel Choir)\n*[[Carlisle Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[York Minster]] (West facade) \n*[[Lichfield Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n*[[Ely Cathedral]] (Portions including Galilee porch, lady chapel and choir (1322-28)\n*[[Melrose Abbey]] (The Lady Chapel) [[Scotland]],<ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n==Perpendicular Gothic {{anchor|Perpendicular Gothic}} (late 13th to mid 16th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The interior of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] conveys an impression of a \"cage\" of stone and glass, typical of Perpendicular architecture.

A notable early example is the  [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], built by the royal architect [[William Ramsey (architect)|William Ramsey]] in 1332. <ref> John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) puts the earliest example of a fully formed Perpendicular style at the [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], in 1332 </ref>  The early style was also practiced by Ramsey and another royal architect,  [[John Sponlee]], and fully developed in the works of [[Henry Yevele]] and [[William Wynford]].\n\nWalls were built much higher than in earlier periods, and stained glass windows became very large, so that the space around them was reduced to simple piers. Horizontal transoms sometimes had to be introduced to strengthen the vertical [[mullions]]. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 53-62</ref>  \n\nMany of the cathedrals and churches were built with magnificent towers ([[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and Boston Church (Lincolnshire), Wrexham Church, Taunton Church, and others. Other Notable examples include [[Kings College, Cambridge|Kings College Chapel, Cambridge]]  <ref name=\"harvey1978\">{{Cite book| title=The Perpendicular Style| first=John| last=Harvey| publisher=Batsford| year=1978}}</ref> \n\nThe interiors of Perpendicular churches were filled with lavish ornamental woodwork, including choir seats with lifting seats (''Misereres''), under which were grotesque carvings;; \"Poppy heads\", or carved figures in foliage on the ends of benches; and elaborate multicoloured decoration, usually in floral patterns, on panels or cornices called ''[[brattishing]]''. <ref>{Smith (1922) pp. 53-62 </ref>   The sinuous lines of the tracery in the Decorated style wee replaced by more geometric forms and [[perpendicular]] lines. <ref name=\"EB1911PP\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Perpendicular Period|volume=21|pages=179\u2013180|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref> \n\nThe style was also affected by the tragic history of the period, particuarly  [[Black Death]] which killed an estimated third of England's population in 18 months between June 1348 and December 1349 and returned in 1361\u201362 to kill another fifth.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

Important towers were built at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[York Minster]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and on many smaller churches.  Decorative [[Battlements]] were a popular decoration of towers in smaller churches.  \n\n* '''Windows''' became very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone [[mullion]]s than in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for [[stained glass]] craftsmen. The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the [[arch]] moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional mullions (supermullions) and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.   The [[Tudor Arch]] window was a particular feature of English Gothic. \n\n* '''[[Buttress]]es''' and wall surfaces were divided into vertical panels.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> \n\n* '''Doorways''' were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch mouldings, the [[spandrel]]s being filled with [[quatrefoil]]s or tracery.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but [[ogee]] and four-centred [[Tudor arch]]es were also introduced.\n\n* Inside the church the [[triforium]] disappeared, or its place was filled with panelling, and greater importance was given to the [[clerestory]] windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this period. The mouldings were  flatter than those of the earlier periods, and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large [[elliptical]] hollows.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/>\n\n* '''Flint architecture'''.  In areas of [[Southern England]] using [[flint]] architecture, elaborate [[flushwork]] decoration in flint and [[ashlar]] was used, especially in the [[wool church]]es of [[East Anglia]].\n\n===Notable examples===\n* [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] (1446\u20131515) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121130024710/http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/]\n* [[Eton College Chapel, Eton]] (1448\u20131482) [http://www.etoncollege.com/OurHistory.aspx]\n* late 15th-century tower, [[New College, Oxford]] (1380\u201386, [[Henry Yevele]]);\n* [[Divinity School, Oxford]] (1427\u201383);\n* [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick|Beauchamp Chapel, Warwick]] (1381\u201391);\n* Quire and tower of [[York Minster]] (1389\u20131407);\n* remodelling of the nave and aisles of [[Winchester Cathedral]] (1399\u20131419);\n* transept and tower of [[Merton College, Oxford]] (1424\u201350);\n* [[Manchester Cathedral]] (1422);\n* central tower of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1454\u201357);\n* central tower of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1475\u201380);\n* choir of [[Sherborne Abbey]] (1475\u2013c. 1580)\n* Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire.

It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

While green libertarians have tended to associate with the Green Party, the movement has grown to encompass [[Economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who advocate [[free market]]s and commonly identify with contemporary [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarianism]].\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\nLike that of the greens, [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] political philosophy is historically rooted in the [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] and [[Social anarchism|social schools]] of [[anarchism]]. [[Anarchist communism|Anarcho-communist]] theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian prince and leading opponent of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[social Darwinism]], developed a theory of how \"mutual aid\" is the real basis for social organization in his ''Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution''<ref>{{Cite web | first=Lee Alan | last=Dugatkin | title=The Prince of Evolution: Peter Kropotkin's Adventures in Science and Politics | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-prince-of-evolution-peter-kropotkin/ | website=[[Scientific American]] | date={{Date|2011-09-13}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}} }}</ref> Another example of this includes [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhonian]] [[Mutualism (movement)|mutualism]].\n\n[[Murray Bookchin]] and the Institute for Social Ecology also sought to further elaborate these ideas.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Murray | last=Bookchin | title=Deep Ecology, Anarcho-Syndicalism and the Future of Anarchist Thought | url=http://www.social-ecology.org/1992/07/deep-ecology-anarcho-syndicalism-and-the-future-of-anarchist-thought/ | publisher=[[Institute for Social Ecology]] | date={{Date|1992-07-11}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}}  }}</ref> Bookchin was one of the main influences behind the formation of the [[German Green Party]], the first green party to win seats in state and national parliaments.\n\nSome more moderate green libertarians are both [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[Grassroots democracy|democratic]]. [[New England Transcendentalism]] (especially [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Bronson Alcott]]) and [[German Romanticism]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and other \"[[Anarcho-primitivism|back to nature]]\" movements combined with anti-war, anti-industrialism, civil liberties and decentralization movements are all part of this tradition. The modern [[Green Party of the United States]] seeks to apply these ideas to a more pragmatic system of democratic governance as opposed to contemporary [[Anarcho-capitalism|right]] or [[left anarchism]].\n\n== Natural capitalism ==\n[[Sustainability]] advocates [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]] posited in their book ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'' (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The 2006 book ''[[Green to Gold (book)|Green to Gold]]'', written by environmental scholars [[Daniel C. Esty]] and Andrew S. Winston, provided ideas on how companies can apply the principles of green libertarianism.<ref name=alter>{{cite web |url=http://gadfly.igc.org/papers/liberty.htm |title=With Liberty for Some |author=Ernest Partridge |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe work of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] is especially important to understanding the organic view{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} of society and how most human institutions, including law and the economy, are \"the result of human action but not of human design\".{{clarify|date=December 2016}} In his last major work, ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'', Hayek differentiates between endogenous orders or self-organizing systems and exogenous orders imposed from without.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\nHayek argues{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} that free and [[sustainable]] societies and economies which support them should follow general guidelines, such as \"[[Seven generation sustainability|7th Generation Principle]]\" rather than specific economic laws and regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/warrior/content/timeline/opendoor/roleOfChief.html|title=Eli Parker: The Role of Chief|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS Online|publisher=|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Balance of ecology and economics ==\n{{original research|section|date=October 2013|discuss=Talk:Green libertarianism#Balance of ecology and economics}}\nA fundamental concern among green libertarians is the health of global [[ecology]] and [[carrying capacity]] in view of [[Adaptation to global warming|climate adaptation]]. The green libertarian philosophy recognizes that ecology and [[economics]] are inseparable. It seeks a system of effective [[environmental law]] that is compatible with civil liberties and [[market economy]].\n\nGreen libertarians believe there should be a clear distinction between [[science]] and [[political ideology]]. For example, a green libertarian might be concerned by the phrases such as \"wealth redistribution\" and \"reducing poverty\" in the [[Stern Review]] and in some [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] documents and statements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Among green libertarians, the preservation of civil and economic [[Individualism|individual freedom]] may take precedence over long-term climate concerns because ultimately humans are part of nature.

While green libertarians have tended to associate with the Green Party, the movement has grown to encompass [[Economic liberalism|economic liberals]] who advocate [[free market]]s and commonly identify with contemporary [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarianism]].\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\nLike that of the greens, [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] political philosophy is historically rooted in the [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] and [[Social anarchism|social schools]] of [[anarchism]]. [[Anarchist communism|Anarcho-communist]] theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian prince and leading opponent of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[social Darwinism]], developed a theory of how \"mutual aid\" is the real basis for social organization in his ''Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution''<ref>{{Cite web | first=Lee Alan | last=Dugatkin | title=The Prince of Evolution: Peter Kropotkin's Adventures in Science and Politics | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-prince-of-evolution-peter-kropotkin/ | website=[[Scientific American]] | date={{Date|2011-09-13}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}} }}</ref> Another example of this includes [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhonian]] [[Mutualism (movement)|mutualism]].\n\n[[Murray Bookchin]] and the Institute for Social Ecology also sought to further elaborate these ideas.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Murray | last=Bookchin | title=Deep Ecology, Anarcho-Syndicalism and the Future of Anarchist Thought | url=http://www.social-ecology.org/1992/07/deep-ecology-anarcho-syndicalism-and-the-future-of-anarchist-thought/ | publisher=[[Institute for Social Ecology]] | date={{Date|1992-07-11}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-05}}  }}</ref> Bookchin was one of the main influences behind the formation of the [[German Green Party]], the first green party to win seats in state and national parliaments.\n\nSome more moderate green libertarians are both [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[Grassroots democracy|democratic]]. [[New England Transcendentalism]] (especially [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Bronson Alcott]]) and [[German Romanticism]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and other \"[[Anarcho-primitivism|back to nature]]\" movements combined with anti-war, anti-industrialism, civil liberties and decentralization movements are all part of this tradition. The modern [[Green Party of the United States]] seeks to apply these ideas to a more pragmatic system of democratic governance as opposed to contemporary [[Anarcho-capitalism|right]] or [[left anarchism]].\n\n== Natural capitalism ==\n[[Sustainability]] advocates [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]] posited in their book ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'' (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The 2006 book ''[[Green to Gold (book)|Green to Gold]]'', written by environmental scholars [[Daniel C. Esty]] and Andrew S. Winston, provided ideas on how companies can apply the principles of green libertarianism.<ref name=alter>{{cite web |url=http://gadfly.igc.org/papers/liberty.htm |title=With Liberty for Some |author=Ernest Partridge |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe work of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] is especially important to understanding the organic view{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} of society and how most human institutions, including law and the economy, are \"the result of human action but not of human design\".{{clarify|date=December 2016}} In his last major work, ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'', Hayek differentiates between endogenous orders or self-organizing systems and exogenous orders imposed from without.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\nHayek argues{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} that free and [[sustainable]] societies and economies which support them should follow general guidelines, such as \"[[Seven generation sustainability|7th Generation Principle]]\" rather than specific economic laws and regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/warrior/content/timeline/opendoor/roleOfChief.html|title=Eli Parker: The Role of Chief|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS Online|publisher=|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Balance of ecology and economics ==\n{{original research|section|date=October 2013|discuss=Talk:Green libertarianism#Balance of ecology and economics}}\nA fundamental concern among green libertarians is the health of global [[ecology]] and [[carrying capacity]] in view of [[Adaptation to global warming|climate adaptation]]. The green libertarian philosophy recognizes that ecology and [[economics]] are inseparable. It seeks a system of effective [[environmental law]] that is compatible with civil liberties and [[market economy]].\n\nGreen libertarians believe there should be a clear distinction between [[science]] and [[political ideology]]. For example, a green libertarian might be concerned by the phrases such as \"wealth redistribution\" and \"reducing poverty\" in the [[Stern Review]] and in some [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] documents and statements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Among green libertarians, the preservation of civil and economic [[Individualism|individual freedom]] may take precedence over long-term climate concerns because ultimately humans are part of nature. They believe that natural ecologies, like the free markets, are dynamic and self-adjusting systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Limited government ===\nAs part of the libertarian tradition, green libertarians maintain that the government itself is responsible for most environmental degradation, either directly or by encouraging and protecting politically powerful corporations and other organized interests which degrade, pollute and deplete the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The government should be thus held accountable to all the same environmental regulations they place on businesses.
