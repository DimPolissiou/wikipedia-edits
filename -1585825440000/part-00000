However, in August 2018, GLOBALFOUNDRIES made the decision to suspend 7&nbsp;nm development and planned production, citing the unaffordable costs to outfit Fab 8 for 7&nbsp;nm production. GLOBALFOUNDRIES held open the possibility of resuming 7&nbsp;nm operations in the future if additional resources could be secured. From this decision GLOBALFOUNDRIES executed a shift in company strategy to focus more effort on FD-SOI manufacturing and R&D. Fab 8 serves a crucial function to supply AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) with CPU Wafers for its Zen line of microprocessors used in the Ryzen, Threadripper and Epyc lines of CPUs. The original Zen and the Zen+ CPUs are of a monolithic design which were produced at Global Foundries Malta Facilities. Going forward AMD will pursue a multiple Chiplet Design with the Zen 2 microprocessor. The Zen 2 will consist of a 14/12&nbsp;nm manufactured IO die surrounded by a number of 7&nbsp;nm Core dies. When Global Foundries announced the suspension of 7&nbsp;nm operations AMD executed a shift in plans transferring production of the 7&nbsp;nm core dies to TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation). There was speculation in some quarters as to where manufacture of the Core Dies would take place. In AMD's 2018 4th Quarter Financial Conference call which took place on January 29, 2019 AMD CEO Lisa Su announced the WSA (Wafer Supply Agreement) governing production and acquisition by AMD from GLOBALFOUNDRIES had been amended for the 7th time. The amendment stated AMD would continue to procure 12&nbsp;nm node and above from Global Foundries while giving AMD latitude to purchase 7&nbsp;nm node manufactured wafers from any source free from paying any royalties. The agreement will run through 2024 and insures that Global Foundries will have work for its Malta plant for that time period. Pricing commitments for Wafers runs through 2021 when it is likely the WSA will be amended again.<ref>{{cite web |title=GLOBALFOUNDRIES Stops All 7nm Development |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development |website=AnandTech |accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Fab 10====\nFab 10,<ref name=\"globalfoundries.com\">{{cite web|url=http://globalfoundries.com/about/jim-doyle|title=Jim Doyle|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> located in [[East Fishkill, New York]], United States, was previously known as IBM Building 323.

However, in August 2018, GLOBALFOUNDRIES made the decision to suspend 7&nbsp;nm development and planned production, citing the unaffordable costs to outfit Fab 8 for 7&nbsp;nm production. GLOBALFOUNDRIES held open the possibility of resuming 7&nbsp;nm operations in the future if additional resources could be secured. From this decision GLOBALFOUNDRIES executed a shift in company strategy to focus more effort on FD-SOI manufacturing and R&D. Fab 8 serves a crucial function to supply AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) with CPU Wafers for its Zen line of microprocessors used in the Ryzen, Threadripper and Epyc lines of CPUs. The original Zen and the Zen+ CPUs are of a monolithic design which were produced at Global Foundries Malta Facilities. Going forward AMD will pursue a multiple Chiplet Design with the Zen 2 microprocessor. The Zen 2 will consist of a 14/12&nbsp;nm manufactured IO die surrounded by a number of 7&nbsp;nm Core dies. When Global Foundries announced the suspension of 7&nbsp;nm operations AMD executed a shift in plans transferring production of the 7&nbsp;nm core dies to TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation). There was speculation in some quarters as to where manufacture of the Core Dies would take place. In AMD's 2018 4th Quarter Financial Conference call which took place on January 29, 2019 AMD CEO Lisa Su announced the WSA (Wafer Supply Agreement) governing production and acquisition by AMD from GLOBALFOUNDRIES had been amended for the 7th time. The amendment stated AMD would continue to procure 12&nbsp;nm node and above from Global Foundries while giving AMD latitude to purchase 7&nbsp;nm node manufactured wafers from any source free from paying any royalties. The agreement will run through 2024 and insures that Global Foundries will have work for its Malta plant for that time period. Pricing commitments for Wafers runs through 2021 when it is likely the WSA will be amended again.<ref>{{cite web |title=GLOBALFOUNDRIES Stops All 7nm Development |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development |website=AnandTech |accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Fab 10====\nFab 10,<ref name=\"globalfoundries.com\">{{cite web|url=http://globalfoundries.com/about/jim-doyle|title=Jim Doyle|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> located in [[East Fishkill, New York]], United States, was previously known as IBM Building 323.

This has limited the capacity of ECOSOC to influence international policies in trade, finance and investment. Reform proposals aim to enhance the relevance and contribution of the council. A major reform was approved by the [[2005 World Summit]] on the basis of proposals submitted by secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/20/mainsection.commentanddebate2 Ian Williams, \"Annan has paid his dues\". ''The Guardian'', 19 September 2005]</ref> The Summit aimed to establish ECOSOC as a quality platform for high-level engagement among member states and with international financial institutions, the private sector and civil society on global trends, policies and action. It was decided to hold biennial high-level Development Cooperation Forums at the national-leadership level by transforming the high-level segment of the Council to review trends in international development cooperation and promote greater coherence in development activities. At the Summit it was also decided to hold annual ministerial-level substantive reviews to assess progress in achieving internationally agreed development goals (particularly the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). These \"Annual Ministerial Reviews\" will be replaced by the [[High-Level Political Forum]] from 2016 onwards after the new post-MDG/post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] are agreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=400&nr=1801&menu=35|title=Session 18: Reviewing and monitoring progress: What have we learned and how can it advance implementation? .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent proposals by the High-Level Panel Report on System-Wide Coherence in November 2006 aimed to establish a forum within the ECOSOC as a counter-model to the exclusive clubs of the [[G8]] and [[G20]]. The Forum was to comprise 27 heads of states (L27, corresponding to half of ECOSOC's membership) to meet annually and provide international leadership in the development area. This proposal, however, was not approved by the General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gca.satrapia.com/+turkmenistan-elected-to-ecosoc-for-2019-2021+|title=Turkmenistan Elected to ECOSOC for 2019-2021 - The Gazette of Central Asia|website=gca.satrapia.com|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Chamber}}Chamber design ==\nThe Economic and Social Council Chamber in the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Conference Building]] was a gift from [[Sweden]]. It was conceived by Swedish architect [[Sven Markelius]], one of the 11 architects in the international team that designed the UN headquarters. Wood from Swedish pine trees was used in the delegates' area for the railings and doors.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe pipes and ducts in the ceiling above the public gallery were deliberately left exposed; the architect believed that anything useful could be left uncovered.

United Nations System, meaning that while they report their activities to the Economic and Social Council, they are mostly free to their own devices. Each individual agency must negotiate with the Council as to what their relationship will look and work like. This leads to a system where different organizations maintain different types of relationships with the Council.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNweDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=These+specialised+agencies+are+autonomous+organisations+working+with+the+United+Nations+and+each+other+inter+alia+through+the+coordinating+machinery+of+the+Economic+and+Social+Council.&source=bl&ots=sEclIHID64&sig=S36Ui9cl4OYaD_6rOHRVa3qUiio&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW8cDP6dbZAhULNI8KHVdSAPwQ6AEISzAD#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice|last=Cohn|first=Theodore H.|date=2016-05-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317334828|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalization101.org/un-specialized-agencies/ |title=UN Specialized Agencies |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Globalization 101 |publisher=The Levin Institute |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Some were created before the United Nations existed and were integrated into the system, others were created by the League of Nations and were integrated by its successor, while others were created by the United Nations itself to meet emerging needs.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe following is a list of the specialized agencies reporting to the Council:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/funds-programmes-specialized-agencies-and-others/ |title=Funds, Programmes, Specialized Agencies and Others |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=United Nations |publisher=United Nations |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)\n* [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO)\n* [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD)\n* [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)\n* [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)\n* [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO)\n* [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU)\n* [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)\n* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO)\n* [[United Nations World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO)\n* [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU)\n* [[World Bank Group]] (WBG)\n** [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD)\n** [[International Development Association]] (IDA)\n** [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC)\n** [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA)\n** [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID)\n* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)\n* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)\n* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO)\n\n== Other related entities, mechanisms and processes ==\n* [[Financing for Development]], the [[Monterrey Consensus]] and Doha Declaration\n* Development Cooperation Forum\n* [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII)\n* Sessional and Standing Committees Expert, ad hoc and related bodies\n* [[United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund]] (UNICEF)\n* [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs]] (UNIATF)\n* [[International Federation for Family Development]] has general consultative status\n\n== {{anchor|'The World Economic and Social Survey 2011: The Great Green Technological Transformation'}}\"World Economic and Social Survey 2011: The Great Green Technological Transformation\" ==\n\nIn a report issued in early July 2011, the UN called for spending nearly US$2&nbsp;trillion on [[green technologies]] to prevent what it termed \"a major planetary catastrophe\", warning that \"It is rapidly expanding energy use, mainly driven by [[fossil fuels]], that explains why humanity is on the verge of breaching planetary [[sustainability]] boundaries through [[global warming]], [[biodiversity loss]], and disturbance of the [[nitrogen-cycle]] balance and other measures of the sustainability of the [[earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]\".{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] added: \"Rather than viewing growth and sustainability as competing goals on a collision course, we must see them as complementary and mutually supportive imperatives\".

This has limited the capacity of ECOSOC to influence international policies in trade, finance and investment. Reform proposals aim to enhance the relevance and contribution of the council. A major reform was approved by the [[2005 World Summit]] on the basis of proposals submitted by secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/20/mainsection.commentanddebate2 Ian Williams, \"Annan has paid his dues\". ''The Guardian'', 19 September 2005]</ref> The Summit aimed to establish ECOSOC as a quality platform for high-level engagement among member states and with international financial institutions, the private sector and civil society on global trends, policies and action. It was decided to hold biennial high-level Development Cooperation Forums at the national-leadership level by transforming the high-level segment of the Council to review trends in international development cooperation and promote greater coherence in development activities. At the Summit it was also decided to hold annual ministerial-level substantive reviews to assess progress in achieving internationally agreed development goals (particularly the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). These \"Annual Ministerial Reviews\" will be replaced by the [[High-Level Political Forum]] from 2016 onwards after the new post-MDG/post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] are agreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=400&nr=1801&menu=35|title=Session 18: Reviewing and monitoring progress: What have we learned and how can it advance implementation? .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent proposals by the High-Level Panel Report on System-Wide Coherence in November 2006 aimed to establish a forum within the ECOSOC as a counter-model to the exclusive clubs of the [[G8]] and [[G20]]. The Forum was to comprise 27 heads of states (L27, corresponding to half of ECOSOC's membership) to meet annually and provide international leadership in the development area. This proposal, however, was not approved by the General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gca.satrapia.com/+turkmenistan-elected-to-ecosoc-for-2019-2021+|title=Turkmenistan Elected to ECOSOC for 2019-2021 - The Gazette of Central Asia|website=gca.satrapia.com|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Chamber}}Chamber design ==\nThe Economic and Social Council Chamber in the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Conference Building]] was a gift from [[Sweden]]. It was conceived by Swedish architect [[Sven Markelius]], one of the 11 architects in the international team that designed the UN headquarters. Wood from Swedish pine trees was used in the delegates' area for the railings and doors.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe pipes and ducts in the ceiling above the public gallery were deliberately left exposed; the architect believed that anything useful could be left uncovered.

Unlike [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark]]s, from which everyday matter is made, [[strange quark]]s are formed in [[pair production|pair-production]] processes in collisions between constituents of the plasma. The dominant mechanism of production involves [[gluon]]s only present when matter has become a quark\u2013gluon plasma. When quark\u2013gluon plasma disassembles into [[hadron]]s in a breakup process, the high availability of strange [[quark|antiquarks]] helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made. Similar considerations are at present made for the heavier [[charm quark|charm]] flavor, which is made at the beginning of the collision process in the first interactions and is only abundant in the high-energy environments of [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]].\n\n==Quark\u2013gluon plasma in the early universe and in the laboratory==\n[[File:strange production 3.svg|thumb|280px|Collision between two highly-energetic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] create an extremely dense environment, in which quarks and gluons may interact as free particles for brief moments.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as example the decay of a negatively charged [[Xi baryon]] (green in figure, dss), into a negative [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}}d) and a neutral [[Lambda baryon]] (uds).

The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show at the same number of participants the same enhancement as could be expected.\n\nAnother remarkable feature of these results comparing CERN and STAR is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different energy available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:strange production 7.gif|thumb|220px]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

As the fireball of matter expands and breaks apart, this, in turn, provides a very high abundance of strange hadrons.  Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.  In that way, the Strangeness has turned today more generally into the Quark Flavor signature of quark\u2013gluon plasma.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I. Kuznetsova\n |author2=J.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "text_old": "'''Strangeness production''' is a signature and a [[diagnostic tool]] of [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] (or QGP) formation and properties.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \u201cWorkshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\u201d held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \u201cSixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\u201d held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Production of strangeness in the thermal collision process==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium. In general, the quark-flavor composition of the plasma varies during its ultra short lifetime as new flavors of quarks such as strangeness are cooked up inside. The up and down quarks from which normal matter is made are easily produced as quark-antiquark pairs in the hot fireball because they have small masses. On the other hand, the next lightest quark flavor, strange quarks, will reach its high quark\u2013gluon plasma thermal abundance only on the most violent collisions generating high temperatures and that at the end of the cooking process.{{Clarify|rewrite \"and that at the end of the cooking process\", there seems to be something missing in that sentence.

Given the ready supply of antiquarks in the \"fireball\", one also finds a multitude of antimatter particles containing more than one strange quark. On the other hand, in a system involving a cascade of nucleon-nucleon collisions, multi-strange antimatter are produced less frequently considering that several relatively improbable events must occur in the same collision process. For this reason one expects that the yield of multi-strange antimatter particles produced in the presence of quark matter is enhanced compared to conventional series of reactions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nStrange quarks also bind with the heavier charm and bottom quarks which also like to bind with each other. Thus in presence of a large number of these quarks quite unusually abundant exotic particles can be produced, some of these have never been observed before. This should be the case in the forthcoming exploration at the new [[Large Hadron Collider]] at CERN of the particles that have both charm and strange quarks, and even bottom quarks as components.\n\n==Strange hadron decay and observation==\n[[File:Strangeness production 4.gif|thumb|280px|Illustration of self-analyzing strange hadron decay: a double strange Xi- decays producing a pi- and invisible Lambda which decays making a characteristic V-signature (pi- and p).

This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as example the decay of a negatively charged [[Xi baryon]] (green in figure, dss), into a negative [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}}d) and a neutral [[Lambda baryon]] (uds). Subsequently, the Lambda decays into a proton and another negative pion. In general this is the signature of the decay of a Xi. Although the negative [[Omega baryon]] (sss) has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the Xi because its decay products are different.\n\nMeasurement of abundant formation of Xi (uss/dss), Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark\u2013gluon plasma has been formed. This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=P.

The first exploratory data point from [[STAR detector|BNL-RHIC-STAR]] (red star) in figure agrees with the CERN data.\n\nIn view of these results the objective of ongoing [[NA61/SHINE]] experiment at CERN [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and the proposed low energy run at BNL [[RHIC]] where in particular the [[STAR detector]] can search for the onset of production of quark\u2013gluon plasma as function of energy in the domain where the horn maximum is seen, in order to improve the understanding of these results, and to record the behavior of other related quark\u2013gluon plasma observables.\n\n==Strangeness and flavor signatures of quark gluon plasma at the Large Hadron Collider==\n\nAt the much higher energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) the production of strangeness in quark gluon plasma saturates leading to quark-level chemical equilibrium yield.  As the fireball of matter expands and breaks apart, this, in turn, provides a very high abundance of strange hadrons.  Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.  In that way, the Strangeness has turned today more generally into the Quark Flavor signature of quark\u2013gluon plasma.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I. Kuznetsova\n |author2=J.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "General further improvement; added references, polished a few sentences and added figure caption.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}

After signing a deal with Sony in 2000, the company created the ''[[Sly Cooper]]'' series for [[PlayStation 2]] using their proprietary game engine SPACKLE (Sucker Punch Animation and Character Kinematics Life Engine). The company's second series, ''[[Infamous (series)|Infamous]]'' for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]], heralded a move from [[Level (computer and video games)|level-based]] games portraying [[cel-shaded]], [[anthropomorphic]] animals to a fully streaming [[open world]] game depicting more realistic-looking humans and protagonists with acrobatic abilities.\n\n[[File:Former_Sucker_Punch_Logo.png|thumb|left|Former logo used from 1999 to 2013]]\nSucker Punch became one of Sony's \"platformer trio\", alongside [[Naughty Dog]] and [[Insomniac Games]]. Although three companies have started to venture into more mature outings, they have recently started to continue their series, such as Naughty Dog handing over production of their latest ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' title to [[High Impact Games]] and Insomniac games continuing the ''[[Ratchet & Clank]]'' series. In addition, Sucker Punch worked on ''Sly Cooper'' for [[Sanzaru Games]] and they have produced ''[[Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time]]''. Sanzaru Games released ''[[Sly Cooper#The Sly Collection|The Sly Collection]]'', a remastered port of  PlayStation 2 ''Sly Cooper'' games for PlayStation 3, in November 2010. In addition, [[Nihilistic Software]] developed ''[[PlayStation Move Heroes]]'', a cross-over PS3 title featuring Sly Cooper and two other popular characters, [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]] and [[Jak (Jak and Daxter)|Jak]]. A sequel to ''Infamous'' was officially announced when the cover of [[Game Informer]]'s July 2010 issue was a picture of ''Infamous 2'', along with the magazine containing a ten-page preview of the game. Sucker Punch teamed up with [[Capcom]] to include Cole MacGrath as a special guest character for PlayStation versions of ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'', and with [[SuperBot Entertainment]] to include both the good and evil versions of Cole and Sly Cooper in ''[[PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale]]''.\n\nThe next game in development, ''[[Ghost of Tsushima]]'', was first revealed at the 2017 [[Paris Games Week]] conference.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. San Isidro was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nIn the 18th century Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was just a part of a settlement as one municipality. When the municipality of San Isidro de Potot (now '''[[Burgos, Pangasinan|Burgos]]''') was created it became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:Jose burgos PG.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, '''Mat\u00edas Guiang''', a mighty sailor from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. He decided to emigrate with his neighbors, family and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the [[Agno River]] by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan. It lies in the coastal sitio of Cabongaoan in barangay Ilio-ilio.\n\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*'''Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)''': Cabongaoan Beach has another feature that makes it a cut above the rest of Pangasinan's beaches: the so-called \"Death Pool.\" This tidal pool on the rocky side of the beach gets filled with water when the waves crash against it. This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho|''Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho/KMJS'']]. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente. The panoramic Sangbay Falls which could be visited best during the ber-months.\n\n[[File:Sangbay Falls.jpg|thumb|right|Sangbay Falls]]\n*'''Rolling Hills''': Other natural attractions in Burgos

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. '''San Isidro''' was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nDuring the Spanish period and the early part of the American era, Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was a part of a settlement as one municipality known as San Isidro de Potot. Burgos may have been the last place to be found in the settlement but even though it still became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, as mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz, the name of the town was changed to\u00a0Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from '''San Isidro''' to '''Burgos''' in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, '''Mat\u00edas Guiang''', a powerful sailor from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. He decided to emigrate with his neighbors, family and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the [[Agno River]] by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan.

[[Old World]] diseases brought by the Spanish settlers appear to have resulted in very high fatalities, disrupting the society, and eventually causing the city to be abandoned.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} One of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, Tulum is today a popular site for [[Tourism|tourists]].\n\n==History and description==\n[[File:MX -Tulum.png|thumb|left|Map of central Tulum]]\n[[File:Tulum_Maya-13.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Tulum Ruins]]\nThe site might have been called '''Zama''', meaning ''City of Dawn,'' because it faces the sunrise. Tulum stands on a bluff facing east toward the [[Caribbean Sea]]. ''Tul\u00fam'' is also the Yucat\u00e1n Mayan word for ''fence'', ''wall''<ref name=apub/> or ''trench.'' The walls surrounding the site allowed the Tulum fort to be defended against invasions. Tulum had access to both land and sea trade routes, making it an important trade hub, especially for [[obsidian]]. From numerous depictions in murals and other works around the site, Tulum appears to have been an important site for the worship of the Diving or Descending god.<ref name=apub/>\n\nTulum was first mentioned by [[Juan D\u00edaz (Spanish conquistador)|Juan D\u00edaz]], a member of [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s Spanish expedition of 1518, the first Europeans to spot Tulum.<ref name=apub/> The first detailed description of the ruins was published by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] in 1843 in the book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan''. As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site's walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic [[Tulum Stela 1|stele]] at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection). This has been interpreted as meaning that the stele was likely built elsewhere and brought to Tulum to be reused.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=657463&partId=1&place=13448&plaA=13448-3-1&page=1 British Museum Collection]</ref>\n\nWork conducted at Tulum continued with that of [[Sylvanus Morley]] and George P. Howe, beginning in 1913. They worked to restore and open the public beaches. The work was continued by the [[Carnegie Institution]] from 1916 to 1922, Samuel Lothrop in 1924 who also mapped the site, Miguel \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez in the late 1930s and early 1940s, William Sanders in 1956, and then later in the 1970s by [[Arthur G. Miller]]. Through these later investigations done by Sanders and Miller, it has been determined that Tulum was occupied during the late [[Postclassic]] period around AD 1200. The site continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish was made in the early 16th century. By the end of the 16th century, the site was abandoned completely.<ref name=\"Maya\">''The Ancient Maya'', Robert J. Sharer and Loa P.

According to [[Craniometry|craniometric]] measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the [[Cephalic index|mesocephalic]] pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of [[syphilis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stinnesbeck|first=Wolfgang|last2=Rennie|first2=Samuel R.|last3=Olgu\u00edn|first3=Jer\u00f3nimo Avil\u00e9s|last4=Stinnesbeck|first4=Sarah R.|last5=Gonzalez|first5=Silvia|last6=Frank|first6=Norbert|last7=Warken|first7=Sophie|last8=Schorndorf|first8=Nils|last9=Krengel|first9=Thomas|last10=Morlet|first10=Adriana Vel\u00e1zquez|last11=Gonz\u00e1lez|first11=Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez|date=2020-02-05|title=New evidence for an early settlement of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico: The Chan Hol 3 woman and her meaning for the Peopling of the Americas|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227984|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=e0227984|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0227984|issn=1932-6203|pmc=7001910|pmid=32023279}}</ref>\n\nAccording to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, \"It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life.

This architecture is recognized by a step running around the base of the building which sits on a low substructure. Doorways of this type are usually narrow with columns used as support if the building is big enough. As the walls flare out there are usually two sets of molding near the top. The room usually contains one or two small windows with an altar at the back wall, roofed by either a beam-and-rubble ceiling or being vaulted.<ref name=\"Tulum\">Muyil-Quintana Roo-Mexico.

The wall also was about {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} long on the side parallel to the sea. The part of the wall that ran the width of the site was slightly shorter and only about {{convert|170|m|ft|sp=us}} on both sides. Constructing this massive wall would have taken an enormous amount of energy and time, which shows how important defense was to the Maya when they chose this site. On the southwest and northwest corners there are small structures that have been identified as watch towers, showing again how well defended the city was. There are five narrow gateways in the wall with two each on the north and south sides and one on the west. Near the northern side of the wall a small [[cenote]] provided the city with fresh water. It is this impressive wall that makes Tulum one of the most well-known fortified sites of the Maya.<ref name=\"Fort\">\"Lowland Maya Fortifications\", David Webster, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. 120, No. 5 (Oct. 15, 1976), pp. 361\u2013371, Published by: [[American Philosophical Society]]</ref>\n\n==== Most famous buildings ====\nThere are three major structures of interest at the Tulum archaeological site. El Castillo, the Temple of the Frescoes, and the Temple of the Descending God.\n\n===== Temple of the Frescoes =====\nAmong the more spectacular buildings here is the Temple of the Frescoes that included a lower gallery and a smaller second story gallery. The Temple of the Frescoes was used as an observatory for tracking the movements of the sun. Niched figurines of the Maya \u201cdiving god\u201d or Venus deity decorate the facade of the temple. This \u201cdiving god\u201d is also depicted in the Temple of the Diving God in the central precinct of the site. Above the entrance in the western wall a stucco figure of the \u201cdiving god\u201d is still preserved, giving the temple its name. A mural can still be seen on the eastern wall that resembles that of a style that originated in highland Mexico, called the Mixteca-Puebla style, though visitors are no longer permitted to enter.\n\n===== Temple of the Descending God =====\nThe Temple of the Descending God consists of a single room with a door to the west and a narrow staircase that was built on top of another temple that served as its base.\n\nIn the niche located at the top of the door stands a sculpture that\u2019s found throughout Tulum. He has wings, a headdress, and holds an object in his hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mayanpeninsula.com/tulum|title=Tulum Arqueological Site Ultimate Guide {{!}} Mayan Peninsula|work=Mayan Peninsula|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===== El Castillo =====\nAlso in the central precinct is the Castillo, which is {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. The Castillo was built on a previous building that was colonnaded and had a beam and mortar roof. The lintels in the upper rooms have serpent motifs carved into them.  The construction of the Castillo appears to have taken place in stages. A small shrine appears to have been used as a beacon for incoming canoes. This shrine marks a break in the barrier reef that is opposite the site. Here there is a cove and landing beach in a break in the sea cliffs that would have been perfect for trading canoes coming in. This characteristic of the site may be one of the reasons the Maya founded the city of Tulum exactly here, as Tulum later became a prominent trading port during the late [[Postclassic]].<ref name=\"Maya\" />\n\n==Trading==\n[[File:Tulum - God of the Winds Temple 03.JPG|thumb|Templo Dios del Viento (God of Winds Temple) guarding Tulum's sea entrance bay.]]\n[[File:Tulum - 12.jpg|thumb|left|\"Temple of the Frescos\"]]\nBoth coastal and land routes converged at Tulum. A number of artifacts found in or near the site show contacts with areas all over Central Mexico and Central America. Copper artifacts from the Mexican highlands have been found near the site, as have flint artifacts, ceramics, incense burners, and gold objects from all over the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]]. Salt and textiles were among some of the goods brought by traders  to Tulum by sea that would be dispersed inland.

and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico. [[Old World]] diseases brought by the Spanish settlers appear to have resulted in very high fatalities, disrupting the society, and eventually causing the city to be abandoned.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} One of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, Tulum is today a popular site for [[Tourism|tourists]].\n\n==History and description==\n[[File:MX -Tulum.png|thumb|left|Map of central Tulum]]\n[[File:Tulum_Maya-13.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Tulum Ruins]]\nThe site might have been called '''Zama''', meaning ''City of Dawn,'' because it faces the sunrise. Tulum stands on a bluff facing east toward the [[Caribbean Sea]]. ''Tul\u00fam'' is also the Yucat\u00e1n Mayan word for ''fence'', ''wall''<ref name=apub/> or ''trench.'' The walls surrounding the site allowed the Tulum fort to be defended against invasions. Tulum had access to both land and sea trade routes, making it an important trade hub, especially for [[obsidian]]. From numerous depictions in murals and other works around the site, Tulum appears to have been an important site for the worship of the Diving or Descending god.<ref name=apub/>\n\nTulum was first mentioned by [[Juan D\u00edaz (Spanish conquistador)|Juan D\u00edaz]], a member of [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s Spanish expedition of 1518, the first Europeans to spot Tulum.<ref name=apub/> The first detailed description of the ruins was published by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] in 1843 in the book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan''. As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site's walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic [[Tulum Stela 1|stele]] at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection). This has been interpreted as meaning that the stele was likely built elsewhere and brought to Tulum to be reused.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=657463&partId=1&place=13448&plaA=13448-3-1&page=1 British Museum Collection]</ref>\n\nWork conducted at Tulum continued with that of [[Sylvanus Morley]] and George P. Howe, beginning in 1913. They worked to restore and open the public beaches. The work was continued by the [[Carnegie Institution]] from 1916 to 1922, Samuel Lothrop in 1924 who also mapped the site, Miguel \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez in the late 1930s and early 1940s, William Sanders in 1956, and then later in the 1970s by [[Arthur G. Miller]]. Through these later investigations done by Sanders and Miller, it has been determined that Tulum was occupied during the late [[Postclassic]] period around AD 1200. The site continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish was made in the early 16th century. By the end of the 16th century, the site was abandoned completely.<ref name=\"Maya\">''The Ancient Maya'', Robert J. Sharer and Loa P.

According to [[Craniometry|craniometric]] measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the [[Cephalic index|mesocephalic]] pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken.

This architecture is recognized by a step running around the base of the building which sits on a low substructure. Doorways of this type are usually narrow with columns used as support if the building is big enough. As the walls flare out there are usually two sets of molding near the top. The room usually contains one or two small windows with an altar at the back wall, roofed by either a beam-and-rubble ceiling or being vaulted.<ref name=\"Tulum\">Muyil-Quintana Roo-Mexico.

The wall also was about {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} long on the side parallel to the sea. The part of the wall that ran the width of the site was slightly shorter and only about {{convert|170|m|ft|sp=us}} on both sides. Constructing this massive wall would have taken an enormous amount of energy and time, which shows how important defense was to the Maya when they chose this site. On the southwest and northwest corners there are small structures that have been identified as watch towers, showing again how well defended the city was. There are five narrow gateways in the wall with two each on the north and south sides and one on the west. Near the northern side of the wall a small [[cenote]] provided the city with fresh water. It is this impressive wall that makes Tulum one of the most well-known fortified sites of the Maya.<ref name=\"Fort\">\"Lowland Maya Fortifications\", David Webster, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. 120, No. 5 (Oct. 15, 1976), pp. 361\u2013371, Published by: [[American Philosophical Society]]</ref>\n\n==== Most famous buildings ====\nThere are three major structures of interest at the Tulum archaeological site. El Castillo, the Temple of the Frescoes, and the Temple of the Descending God.\n\n===== Temple of the Frescoes =====\nAmong the more spectacular buildings here is the Temple of the Frescoes that included a lower gallery and a smaller second story gallery. The Temple of the Frescoes was used as an observatory for tracking the movements of the sun. Niched figurines of the Maya \u201cdiving god\u201d or Venus deity decorate the facade of the temple. This \u201cdiving god\u201d is also depicted in the Temple of the Diving God in the central precinct of the site. Above the entrance in the western wall a stucco figure of the \u201cdiving god\u201d is still preserved, giving the temple its name. A mural can still be seen on the eastern wall that resembles that of a style that originated in highland Mexico, called the Mixteca-Puebla style, though visitors are no longer permitted to enter.\n\n===== Temple of the Descending God =====\nThe Temple of the Descending God consists of a single room with a door to the west and a narrow staircase that was built on top of another temple that served as its base.\n\nIn the niche located at the top of the door stands a sculpture that\u2019s found throughout Tulum. He has wings, a headdress, and holds an object in his hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mayanpeninsula.com/tulum|title=Tulum Arqueological Site Ultimate Guide {{!}} Mayan Peninsula|work=Mayan Peninsula|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===== El Castillo =====\nAlso in the central precinct is the Castillo, which is {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. The Castillo was built on a previous building that was colonnaded and had a beam and mortar roof. The lintels in the upper rooms have serpent motifs carved into them.  The construction of the Castillo appears to have taken place in stages. A small shrine appears to have been used as a beacon for incoming canoes. This shrine marks a break in the barrier reef that is opposite the site. Here there is a cove and landing beach in a break in the sea cliffs that would have been perfect for trading canoes coming in. This characteristic of the site may be one of the reasons the Maya founded the city of Tulum exactly here, as Tulum later became a prominent trading port during the late [[Postclassic]].<ref name=\"Maya\" />\n\n==Trading==\n[[File:Tulum - God of the Winds Temple 03.JPG|thumb|Templo Dios del Viento (God of Winds Temple) guarding Tulum's sea entrance bay.]]\n[[File:Tulum - 12.jpg|thumb|left|\"Temple of the Frescos\"]]\nBoth coastal and land routes converged at Tulum. A number of artifacts found in or near the site show contacts with areas all over Central Mexico and Central America. Copper artifacts from the Mexican highlands have been found near the site, as have flint artifacts, ceramics, incense burners, and gold objects from all over the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]]. Salt and textiles were among some of the goods brought by traders  to Tulum by sea that would be dispersed inland. Typical exported goods included feathers and copper objects that came from inland sources. These goods could be transported by sea to rivers such as the [[R\u00edo Motagua]] and the R\u00edo Usumacincta/Pasi\u00f3n system, which could be traveled inland, giving seafaring canoes access to both the highlands and the lowlands.\n\nThe [[R\u00edo Motagua]] starts from the highlands of Guatemala and empties into the Caribbean. The R\u00edo Pasi\u00f3n/Ucamacincta river system also originates in the Guatemalan highlands and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. It may have been one of these seafaring canoes that Christopher Columbus first encountered off the shores of the Bay Islands of Honduras.<ref name=\"carr\">''The Peoples of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archeology and Traditional Culture,'' Nicholas J.
