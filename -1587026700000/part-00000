Many people from France, Spain, and the French [[Caribbean]] settled here. During the century, it grew with both white Creoles of French and Spanish descent, as well as mixed-race Creoles of French, Spanish, [[African people|African]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent. They were also joined by immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe Bywater is home to the site at which [[Homer Plessy]] was removed from an East Louisiana Railroad car for violating the separate car act, an event that resulted in the [[Plessy v.

By the late 1990s the [[bohemianism|bohemian]], artistic type of communities such as were found in the French Quarter mid-20th century had spread to Bywater, and many long-neglected 19th-century houses began to be refurbished.\n\nBywater and neighboring [[Faubourg Marigny]] are two of the most colorful neighborhoods in the city. The architectural styles borrow heavily from the colonial French and Spanish and have elements of the Caribbean. This blending over the last three centuries has resulted in an architectural style unique to the city of New Orleans.\n\nAs the section of Bywater on the River side of [[St. Claude Avenue]] was one of the few portions of the 9th Ward to escape major flooding in [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina]], it has made steady progress toward recovery, more so than many other parts of the city.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Sallie Ann Glassman]] artist, Voodoo priestess\n* [[Dave Pirner]] of the 1990s Grunge band [[Soul Asylum]]\n* [[Ani DiFranco]] singer/songwriter\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neighborhoods in New Orleans]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Bywater, New Orleans|position=left}}\n{{Wikivoyage|New Orleans/Bywater}}\n* [http://www.nolacemeteries.com/roch.html St. Roch Cemetery in the Bywater]\n* [http://www.bywater.org/ Bywater Neighborhood Association]\n* [http://www.scadnola.com St. Claude Arts District]\n* [http://www.faubourgmarigny.org Faubourg Marigny Improvement Association]\n\n{{New Orleans District 7}}\n{{Orleans Parish, Louisiana}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Downtown New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Louisiana populated places on the Mississippi River]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Bywater\n| native_name             = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = New Orleans neighborhood\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = Mazant1.jpg\n| image_caption           = The Mazant on Mazant Street in Bywater\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| motto                   = \n| nickname                = \n| etymology               = \n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = United States\n| subdivision_type1       = State\n| subdivision_name1       = Louisiana\n| subdivision_type2       = City\n| subdivision_name2       = [[New Orleans]]\n| subdivision_type3       = Planning District\n| subdivision_name3       = District 7, Bywater District\n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_map             = \n| pushpin_relief          = \n| pushpin_map_caption     =  \n| coordinates             = {{coord|29|57|46|N|90|02|24|W|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = \n| established_date        = \n<!-- area -->\n| area_footnotes          = \n| dunam_link              = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| area_total_sq_mi        = 1.33\n| area_land_sq_mi         = 0.94\n| area_water_sq_mi        = 0.39\n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| elevation_ft            = 3\n<!-- population -->\n| population_as_of        = 2010\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = 2181\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_density_sq_mi=\n| population_demonym      = \n<!-- time zone(s) -->\n| timezone1               = [[North American Central Time Zone|CST]]\n| utc_offset1             = -6\n| timezone1_DST           = [[North American Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n| utc_offset1_DST         = -5\n| timezone2               =  \n| utc_offset2             = \n| timezone2_DST           = \n| utc_offset2_DST         = \n<!-- postal codes, area code -->\n| postal_code_type        = ZIP Codes\n| postal_code             = \n| area_code_type          =  \n| area_code               = [[Area code 504|504]]\n| geocode                 = \n| iso_code                = \n<!-- website, footnotes -->\n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n'''Bywater''' is a [[Neighborhoods in New Orleans|neighborhood]] of the city of [[New Orleans]].

Reagan and Smirnoff immediately hit it off, due to Reagan's love of jokes about life in the Soviet Union. Reagan enjoyed telling such jokes in speeches, and Smirnoff became one of his sources for new material.

When she approaches him he denies knowing her. \n\nThe incident causes Juliet to reflect back to 1940 when she was a young 18-year-old woman who had recently been orphaned. Hired to work at [[MI5]], she is quickly scouted for an operation run by the elusive Perry Gibbons. Working out of two flats, the MI5 team reveal that they are spying on a group of low-level Nazi sympathisers who report to MI5 spy Godfrey Toby, believing he is a secret spy for the [[Gestapo]]. The walls are bugged with microphones and Juliet's job is to transcribe the audio recordings of their conversations. \n\nJuliet develops a crush on Perry, who seems to encourage speculation that they are having an affair but does not return her affections. Instead he recruits her to ingratiate herself to a woman named Mrs. Scaife, hoping that she will lead them to the Red Book, a rumoured ledger containing the names of influential Nazi sympathisers. Juliet is given the false name Iris Carter-Jenkins. She is also approached by Oliver Alleyne, Perry's boss, who asks her to spy on Godfrey. Juliet does so, but despite noticing Godfrey acting suspiciously does not report back to Oliver. \n\nWhile searching for the Red Book in Mrs. Scaife's house Juliet accidentally leaves behind her handbag, containing her real identity card, and asks Mrs. Scaife's maid, an orphan named Beatrice Dodd, to help cover for her. \n\nA few days later Juliet is proposed to by Perry, who she doesn't realise is gay. The following morning Juliet is sought out by the police who believed she was dead as they found the body of a young woman with her identification papers. Juliet realises that the body is Beatrice Dodd and is frightened as the location her body was found in was one mentioned by Godfrey Toby's Nazi sympathisers. A few days later Juliet takes part in a sting operation during which Mrs. Scaife is arrested.\n\nBy 1950 Juliet is working at the BBC after the operation, and her relationship with Perry, quickly dissolved. However, she still has MI5 ties and allows her apartment to be used as a safe house for Soviet defectors. At work she receives an anonymous note telling her that she will never be able to pay for what she has done. Juliet grows paranoid, believing the note comes from one of Godrey's recruits. After Mrs. Scaife's arrest, Juliet and Godfrey were involved in killing Dolly, one of the low-level Nazi sympathisers, after she accidentally discovered their operation. However none of the other living members of the circle ever discovered what Juliet had done. On her way home from the BBC Juliet is attacked, but is relieved to find that her attacker is a former spy named Nelly Varga who was persuaded to work for MI5 after they kidnapped her dog, a dog Juliet was put in charge of who later died.\n\nReturning home Juliet finds a mysterious visitor waiting for her, a friend of Godfrey's, and realises she was being spied on for years by MI5 as she was a double agent for the Soviets, recruited at her MI5 interview. Godfrey's friend persuades her to betray her soviet handlers. Juliet realises she will never truly be free of either party. She tries to escape but is quickly caught by MI5 agents. However Nelly Varga attacks her a second time, allowing her to escape, and Perry helps to smuggle her to [[Holland]].

Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].

[[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].\n\nDickov played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1990 to 2011, starting his career with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he won the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1994, but often struggled to hold a place in the first team and spent time on loan with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] before moving to  [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1996 who were then in [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. Over six seasons at the club, Dickov experienced two [[promotion and relegation|promotions]] and two relegations, playing in three different divisions. Dickov left in 2002 to join [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he stayed for two seasons and, in 2004, he signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and was part of the team which qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]]. Upon the expiry of his Blackburn contract in 2006, he rejoined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and later went on to play for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. In 2000, he made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. In total he represented his country ten times, scoring one goal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Arsenal===\nBorn in [[Livingston, West Lothian]],<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> Paul started playing football around the age of nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he caught the eye of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Dickov joined the youth ranks of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] chances were limited for Dickov as he struggled to break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as [[Ian Wright]]. He helped the club win the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1994, and beforehand he had been a member of Arsenal's squad during its first season in the [[Premier League]]. Whilst at [[Highbury]] he spent several loan spells at both [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.\n\n===Manchester City===\nDickov joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 August 1996 in a transfer valued between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31 million,<ref name=\"James\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}}p218.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Dickov| publisher=Manchester City F.C. | url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502| accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012017/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7B439A001B-9F18-408E-BD8E-8466AB3C97FD%7D&bioid=12712&siteid=502 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> the final signing of [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]]'s Manchester City management.

A regular starter under [[Asa Hartford]], [[Steve Coppell]] and [[Phil Neal]], he played less frequently under [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], and finished the season with five goals from 25 League starts. At the start of the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season, Dickov did not feature in the first team, but was restored to the starting line-up following injuries to [[Uwe R\u00f6sler]] and [[Lee Bradbury]]. Dickov finished the season as the City's top scorer with nine goals, but the club were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history after finishing in 22nd place.\n\nDickov, wearing the number 9 shirt, played a supporting role in a striking partnership with [[Shaun Goater]] in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including a [[hat-trick]] against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. After a slow start, his form improved in the later part of the season, leading to City manager Joe Royle nicknaming him \"the crocus\" due to him coming to life in the spring months.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dickov-a-mixture-of-light-and-dark-72387.html |title=Dickov - A mixture of dark and light |publisher = [[the Independent]] |date = 9 January 2004}}</ref>\nHe scored an important equaliser against [[Wigan Athletic]] in the play off semi final first leg (which was also the last ever goal to be scored at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dickov-keeps-city-in-the-hunt-1094115.html |title=Dickov keeps City in the hunt |publisher=[[the Independent]] |date=15 May 1999 |accessdate=19 April 2010 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Hadfield}}</ref> The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time equaliser in the final of the promotion playoffs against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].

St John Ambulance [[Western Australia]] announced in March 2013 that the current cadet program would be abolished in that state, including the disbandment of all cadet divisions, to make way for a cadetship program for persons aged between 16 and 18 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.stjohnambulance.com.au/new-era-for-st-john-student-program/ |title= New era for St John student program  |publisher=St John Ambulance Western Australia |accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\nAnd in 2017 St John Ambulance Queensland announced that their cadet program would be closed down and a first aid in schools program would replace it.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nFollowing the formation of [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|St John Ambulance cadets in the United Kingdom]] in 1922, St John in Australia soon had one of the first overseas cadet divisions. This was the [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] Ambulance Cadet Division which was registered on 19 December 1925.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp39\">Ian Howie-Wills.

This changed and the cadet movement organised itself to become a national youth organisation of itself.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp39\"/>\n\nIn 1978, the Cadet Handbook was published for the first time by Australian Headquarters staff in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp40\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 40.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref> The handbook explains the rules and regulations under which cadets and the cadet organisation must operate, as well as providing important information to cadets and parents alike.\n\nThe 1970s also yielded another important development \u2013 a Chief Officer for Cadets was appointed to the national staff. They became responsible for the nationwide overall direction of cadets, as well as liaising with their state/territory counterparts. Since then, eight people have held the position to date.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 41.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref>\n\nMembership numbers were in decline during this period. After reaching their high point at 7,584 cadets in 321 divisions during the late 1960s, membership declined steadily until 1990 when there were a mere 4,128 cadets in 206 divisions. Since then, cadet membership has remained more or less at around 4,000.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\n=== 1990\u2013present ===\nThe 1990s were an important decade for the cadet movement, in that a change of emphasis resulted from a review into the movement by the national staff in [[Canberra]]. It was decided that rather than treating the cadet organisation as merely a recruiting area for adult divisions, that it should be turned more into a true [[youth movement]].\n\nWith this in mind, the Australian Youth Council was founded in 1997, composed of two representatives aged between 15 and 25 from each state/territory.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp42\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 42.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref>\n\nCadet numbers have been in decline for some years, largely due to a lack of promotion and resources from state offices. St. John Ambulance in Western Australia even announced in March 2013 that the entire cadet movement would be abolished in that state, involving the dissolution of all cadet divisions and its replacement by an in-school program. A campaign opposing the changes has been organised, involving St. John members from across Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-St-John-Ambulance-Cadets-in-WA/503357589720658 |title= Save St John Ambulance Cadets in WA |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=20 March 2013}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}</ref>\nIn 2017 it was announced that the cadet program in Queensland would dismantled by the end of the year. Cadets between 16\u201318 years old were given the option to join St John Event Health Services as volunteers. It was stated that they would be moving towards a first aid in schools program.\n\n== Structure ==\n*National Headquarters, [[St John Ambulance Australia]]\n**Australian Youth Advisory Network (AYAN)\n*Chief Officer (Youth)\n*State/territory headquarters\n**State/territory youth council\n*State/territory youth officer\n**State/territory youth officers\n*Area Youth Co-ordinators\n*Divisional Youth staff\n**Youth officers\n**Youth leaders\n**Youth [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]\n\nState/territory youth councils only act in an advisory role with regards to youth policy and operations and do not have their own decision-making powers.\n\nState/territory youth [[wikt:officer|officers]] may appoint further officers to assist them in their duties, such as youth training.\n\nPreviously, the role of youth liaison officer in some states was in concert with the role of the regional youth officer, such as in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] where regional youth officers no longer exist. However, in some state/territories, regional youth officers still fulfil these roles.\n\nYouth divisions are headed by a divisional officer, who is in turn assisted by youth leaders and youth NCOs. The divisional officer may also have adult members assisting them, as well as other divisional officers or adult NCOs. This often depends on the side of the division. Youth divisions may also be 'combined' with an adult division, meaning that they share resources and are essentially the same division, with the same divisional superintendent, same meeting place and same equipment. School divisions also exist across Australia, such as Bonnyrigg High School Division in [[Western Sydney]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ozteacher.com.au/html/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1445:bonnyriggs-first-aid-force&catid=3:classroom-news&Itemid=66 |title= Bonnyrigg's first aid force |publisher=Australian Teacher Magazine |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> and [[Carey Baptist Grammar School|Carey Grammar Division]] in Victoria.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n{{Further|St John Ambulance Australia ranks and insignia}}\n\n==== Youth members ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Ranks and Insignia of [[St John Ambulance Australia]] Youth\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Youth||Youth Squad Leader||Youth Senior Leader||Senior Youth||Senior Youth Squad Leader||Senior Youth Senior Leader||Youth Leader\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[Image:sjaa-cadet.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-corp.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-sergeant.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-senior-cadet.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-senior-cadet-corp.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-senior-cadet-sergeant.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-cadet-leader.png|100px]]\n|-\n|''Notes''||Members aged between 12 and 14 years of age and in possession of a [[First aid#Australia|Basic First Aid Certificate]].||As for youth, but with leadership responsibilities.||As for youth, but with more leadership responsibilities than Youth Squad Leaders||Members aged between 15 and 18 and completed Apply First Aid.||As for Senior Youth, but with leadership responsibilities.||As for Senior Youth, but with more leadership responsibilities than Senior Youth Squad Leaders.||An adult member between 18 and 25 that has undertaken a specific leadership course and is ranked above youth but below all adult ranks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cadet Leaders 18 to 25|url=http://cadets.stjohn.org.au/index.php/cadet-leaders-18-25|website=St John Cadets|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==== Youth officers ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Ranks and Insignia of [[St John Ambulance Australia|St John Ambulance]] (Youth officers up to [[States of Australia|State]] level)\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Officer Grade 6||Officer Grade 5||Officer Grade 4||Officer Grade 3||Officer Grade 2||Officer Grade 1\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off6.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off5.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off4.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off3.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off2.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off1.png|100px]]\n|-\n|'''Notes'''||Youth Divisional Officer.||Youth Divisional Officer.||Youth Divisional Superintendent,<ref group=Note name=Note01/> <br> regional youth officer, youth liaison officer.||Regional youth officer, youth liaison officer.||State/Territory youth officer.||State/Territory Chief Officer (Youth).\n|}\nYouth 11 to 18 years of age.\nSenior Youth (Blue) from 15 years of age.\n\n== Australian Youth Advisory Network ==\nAYAN is the primary body within St John for communicating and consulting with and representing the views of young members (aged 12 to 26 years).\n\nAYAN aims to:\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0communicate with young members in the places they hang out (e.g. on social media)\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0consult with young people nationally and understand their point of view\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0represent young peoples\u2019 views to decision-makers in St John nationally\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0help St John to achieve its goal of making first aid a part of everybody's life.\n\n==== How does AYAN connect with young people? ====\nAYAN use technology to regularly connect and engage with young people, advocating to and acting as a conduit to assist decision-makers to realise the goals of the organisation.

This training mainly takes place during weekly divisional meetings, but can also extend to statewide or nationwide events, such as the National Cadet Camp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnsa.com.au/stjohnyouthandcadets/ |title= St John Juniors & Cadets |publisher=[[St John Ambulance Australia]] ([[South Australia]]) |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> Cadets learn a wide variety of first aid skills, including [[CPR]], [[asthma]] treatment and bandaging.\n\n=== Proficiency badges ===\nThere are currently 37 proficiency badges available to youth in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohn.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=134&Itemid=423 |title= Cadet Proficiency Badges  |publisher=[[St John Ambulance Australia]] |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\nThese include awards in respect of:\n\n*[[ANZAC]] heritage\n*Boating\n*Campcraft\n*Canoeing\n*Carers\n*Caring for animals\n*Casualty simulation\n*Childcare\n*Citizenship\n*Communications\n*Cookery and nutrition\n*Cultural diversity\n*Cycling\n*Driver education\n*Emergency management\n*Employment preparation\n*Environmental studies\n*Eye health\n*Family care\n*Fire safety\n*Handicrafts\n*Health and wellbeing\n*Home maintenance\n*Hygienic food handling\n*Indigenous studies\n*International friendship\n*Knowledge of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order]]\n*Library skills\n*Living skills\n*Map reading\n*Music\n*Office skills\n*Personal safety\n*Public relations\n*Road safety\n*Sports\n*Swimming and lifesaving\n\n== Uniform ==\nYouth members, as with adults, are usually required to regularly attend meetings and participate in divisional activities for at least a few months before receiving their uniform. This new initiative was instituted due to many new members being issued uniforms and then leaving soon afterwards, taking the uniforms with them and never returning them.\n\nThe youth uniform is similar to the Duty Order 1 adult uniform:\n*White short-sleeved shirt with [[epaulette]] holders, pen holders and St. John flashes;\n*Black long pants (or below-knee-height skirts for females);\n*Black [[baseball cap]] with the St. John logo;\n*Black clip-on [[Necktie|tie]];\n*Black jumper with shoulder flashes, epaulettes, elbow patches and pen holders;\n*Name plates;\n*Black socks; and\n*Black shoes.<ref name=\"opsbranchuniform\">St. John Ambulance Australia, ''Operations Branch uniform guidelines'', p. 6\u201316 August 2010</ref>\n\nYouth members are also issued with the appropriate epaulettes. They may also be issued with a high visibility vest for use on public duties. The distinctive black broad-brimmed hat is also no longer issued to youth members in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] due to budget cuts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnvic.com.au/extranet/art-cadet-junior-headwear-correction.asp |title= *CORRECTION* Cadet and Junior Headwear |publisher=[[St John Ambulance Australia]] ([[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]) |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nCadets in Western Australia are instead issued the same uniforms as paramedics \u2013 known as \"Greens\". Their rank tag states \"Cadet\" on the front left breast pocket and on the rear of the shirt piece. All badges are reflective in design.\n\n== Activities ==\nMany different activities are provided for in the cadet programme. These include statewide and nationwide events, such as the national cadet camp and national cadet first aid championships.\n\nThe St John Ambulance Australia Cadet National Championship began in the 1960s. At the time there were 4 categories for competition; Ambulance Cadet Team, Ambulance Cadet Individual, Nursing Cadet Team and Nursing Cadet Individual. The Ambulance Cadet categories were for boys between 11 and 18 years of age and the Nursing Cadet categories were for girls of the same age. They were held on alternating years until 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 1985, the championships amalgamated when the girls and boys cadet groups joined. A two new categories were added, the Cadet Leader Individual and the Champion State/Territory, and the Ambulance and the Nursing trophies were reassigned to become singular team and individual Championships.\n\nAt this time, the St John National Champion badge was also introduced. Initially, it was only granted to the winners of the Cadet Team, Cadet Individual and Cadet Leader Championships, however, since 2003 it has been also granted to the winners of the Champion State/Territory, regardless of their rankings in their relevant events.\nEach year these competitions are held in January at the National Cadet Camp (NatCamp). In 2014, the camp and competitions will be held in New South Wales and will be an international camp with there being the National Championships but also the international competitions with countries invited to send competitors from all over the world where St John is established.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n== Code of Chivalry ==\nAll cadets and juniors are required to recite the Code of Chivalry at least once during their membership. Many divisions will recite the code at the beginning or conclusion of every meeting. The code originates from the historical origins of [[St. John Ambulance Australia|St John Ambulance]] \u2013 the [[Venerable Order of St John]].\n\nThe previous version of the code required cadets to 'serve God', but this was changed in the 1990s to 'serve my God' to avoid excluding those of no [[Agnostic|religion]] or those who are not [[Christians|Christian]].\n\nIt has eight major points, representing the eight points of the [[Maltese cross]] of the [[Venerable Order of St John]].<ref name=\"cadethandbook1\">St John Ambulance Australia.

Awards are not worn on jumpers.<ref name=\"opsbranchuniform\"/>\n\n=== Exemplary conduct awards ===\nAwards for exemplary conduct may vary throughout Australia, but in most states/territories there is some form of 'cadet of the year' award, usually with one award for male cadets and one award for female cadets. They are awarded to recognise excellence in the cadet movement.\n\nDivisions may also have their own unofficial awards, which can vary.\n\n=== Grand Prior's badge ===\nThis is the second highest award that a cadet can receive and is awarded to cadets who have earned 12 proficiency badges, including the Knowledge of the Order Badge and the Family Care Badge. The first [[Grand Prior Award|Grand Prior's]] badges in the world were awarded in 1933 to three cadets \u2013 two from the United Kingdom and the other from Australia; Marion Higgins from [[Marrickville]] Cadet Nursing Division.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\nThe award is worn on the left sleeve for as long as the cadet remains a member of the Operations Branch \u2013 even if they become an adult.<ref name=\"opsbranchuniform\"/>\n\n=== Commissioner's badge ===\nSimilar to the [[Grand Prior Award|Grand Prior's]] badge, this award is the highest that any junior can achieve. It is awarded to juniors who have earned 10 interest badges and is worn on the right breast pocket of a shirt or battlejacket.\n\n=== Southern Cross Award ===\nThe Southern Cross Award is designed to provide a flexible framework of personal development and achievement for members aged 16 to 25. The activities are not predetermined\u2014youth members choose activities that are relevant to them. Youth members also set their own goals, work within their own time-frames and make their own decisions about what activities will help them achieve their award goals.\n\nTo complete this award youth members are required to progress through three levels: bronze, silver and gold, receiving a badge for each level completed. Each level has four subject areas. Youth members complete one activity from each of the subject areas for each badge moving progressively from bronze to gold.\n\nTo find out all about the award and download an application form visit [[:File:///\\\\\\\\STJNO-FS01\\\\company\\\\!Youth\\\\!NYG\\\\2019\\\\Youth Handbook Review 2019\\\\ayan.org.au\\\\opportunities|ayan.org.au/opportunities]].\n\n=== The Sovereign's Award ===\nThe Sovereign's Award is the premier youth award in St John internationally. This is the only award to bear the personal signature of the Sovereign Head of the Order. It ranks immediately senior to the Grand Prior Award.\n\nThe Sovereign's Award is given to young members in recognition of outstanding work in three key areas: \u00a0\n\n1. personal development\n\n2. benefit to St John Ambulance Australia\n\n3. benefit to the community.\n\nThe format in which the candidate presents their final work may be of their own choice, but it must:\n\n* demonstrate a need for the project in the community \n* include a written summary or equivalent portfolio of work of the project that is of a high standard \n* where a written piece is submitted, include appropriate referencing/citation of any sources used \n* where a creative/non-written work is submitted, include a short explanatory piece on the project's purpose, how the idea came about/the need demonstrated in the community, its development over time and how it will be used to benefit the individual, community or St John \n* be finalised within a three-year period, but not less than 18 months, from the commencement date.\n\n=== Service awards ===\nCadets are able to attend public duties and treat patients within their [[Good Samaritan law|scope of practice]], provided that they are supervised by an adult. To acknowledge their contribution to St. John's work, a number of service shields have been developed. They include 100-hour, 200-hour and 500-hour service shields. In 1978, the Chief Commissioner introduced the Special Service Certificate, awarded to cadets who have completed at least 1000 hours of duties.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\n=== Other awards ===\nMany other awards are available for cadets to wear and be awarded. These include external awards, such as the [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|Duke of Edinburgh's Award]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[St John Ambulance Australia]]\n*[[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK]]\n*[[St John Youth New Zealand]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note|refs=\n<ref name=Note01>Only applicable if the cadet division is not combined with an adult division.

St John Ambulance [[Western Australia]] announced in March 2013 that the current cadet program would be abolished in that state, including the disbandment of all cadet divisions, to make way for a cadetship program for persons aged between 16 and 18 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.stjohnambulance.com.au/new-era-for-st-john-student-program/ |title= New era for St John student program  |publisher=St John Ambulance Western Australia |accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\nAnd in 2017 St John Ambulance Queensland announced that their cadet program would be closed down and a first aid in schools program would replace it.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nFollowing the formation of [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|St John Ambulance cadets in the United Kingdom]] in 1922, St John in Australia soon had one of the first overseas cadet divisions. This was the [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] Ambulance Cadet Division which was registered on 19 December 1925.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp39\">Ian Howie-Wills.

This changed and the cadet movement organised itself to become a national youth organisation of itself.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp39\"/>\n\nIn 1978, the Cadet Handbook was published for the first time by Australian Headquarters staff in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp40\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 40.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref> The handbook explains the rules and regulations under which cadets and the cadet organisation must operate, as well as providing important information to cadets and parents alike.\n\nThe 1970s also yielded another important development \u2013 a Chief Officer for Cadets was appointed to the national staff. They became responsible for the nationwide overall direction of cadets, as well as liaising with their state/territory counterparts. Since then, eight people have held the position to date.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 41.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref>\n\nMembership numbers were in decline during this period. After reaching their high point at 7,584 cadets in 321 divisions during the late 1960s, membership declined steadily until 1990 when there were a mere 4,128 cadets in 206 divisions. Since then, cadet membership has remained more or less at around 4,000.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\n=== 1990\u2013present ===\nThe 1990s were an important decade for the cadet movement, in that a change of emphasis resulted from a review into the movement by the national staff in [[Canberra]]. It was decided that rather than treating the cadet organisation as merely a recruiting area for adult divisions, that it should be turned more into a true [[youth movement]].\n\nWith this in mind, the Australian Youth Council was founded in 1997, composed of two representatives aged between 15 and 25 from each state/territory.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp42\">Ian Howie-Wills. ''A Very Short History of the Order of St John (Emphasising its Australian History)''. 2004, p. 42.{{ISBN|0 949569 50 X}}</ref>\n\nCadet numbers have been in decline for some years, largely due to a lack of promotion and resources from state offices. St. John Ambulance in Western Australia even announced in March 2013 that the entire cadet movement would be abolished in that state, involving the dissolution of all cadet divisions and its replacement by an in-school program. A campaign opposing the changes has been organised, involving St. John members from across Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-St-John-Ambulance-Cadets-in-WA/503357589720658 |title= Save St John Ambulance Cadets in WA |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=20 March 2013}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}</ref>\nIn 2017 it was announced that the cadet program in Queensland would dismantled by the end of the year. Cadets between 16\u201318 years old were given the option to join St John Event Health Services as volunteers. It was stated that they would be moving towards a first aid in schools program.\n\n== Structure ==\n*National Headquarters, [[St John Ambulance Australia]]\n**Australian Youth Advisory Network (AYAN)\n*Chief Officer (Youth)\n*State/territory headquarters\n**State/territory youth council\n*State/territory youth officer\n**State/territory youth officers\n*Area Youth Co-ordinators\n*Divisional Youth staff\n**Youth officers\n**Youth leaders\n**Youth [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]\n\nState/territory youth councils only act in an advisory role with regards to youth policy and operations and do not have their own decision-making powers.\n\nState/territory youth [[wikt:officer|officers]] may appoint further officers to assist them in their duties, such as youth training.\n\nPreviously, the role of youth liaison officer in some states was in concert with the role of the regional youth officer, such as in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] where regional youth officers no longer exist. However, in some state/territories, regional youth officers still fulfil these roles.\n\nYouth divisions are headed by a divisional officer, who is in turn assisted by youth leaders and youth NCOs. The divisional officer may also have adult members assisting them, as well as other divisional officers or adult NCOs. This often depends on the side of the division. Youth divisions may also be 'combined' with an adult division, meaning that they share resources and are essentially the same division, with the same divisional superintendent, same meeting place and same equipment. School divisions also exist across Australia, such as Bonnyrigg High School Division in [[Western Sydney]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ozteacher.com.au/html/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1445:bonnyriggs-first-aid-force&catid=3:classroom-news&Itemid=66 |title= Bonnyrigg's first aid force |publisher=Australian Teacher Magazine |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> and [[Carey Baptist Grammar School|Carey Grammar Division]] in Victoria.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n{{Further|St John Ambulance Australia ranks and insignia}}\n\n==== Youth members ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Ranks and Insignia of [[St John Ambulance Australia]] Youth\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Youth||Youth Squad Leader||Youth Senior Leader||Senior Youth||Senior Youth Squad Leader||Senior Youth Senior Leader||Youth Leader\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[Image:sjaa-cadet.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-corp.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-sergeant.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-cadet-rank-senior-cadet.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-senior-cadet-corp.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-senior-cadet-sergeant.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-cadet-leader.png|100px]]\n|-\n|''Notes''||Members aged between 12 and 14 years of age and in possession of a [[First aid#Australia|Basic First Aid Certificate]].||As for youth, but with leadership responsibilities.||As for youth, but with more leadership responsibilities than Youth Squad Leaders||Members aged between 15 and 18 and completed Apply First Aid.||As for Senior Youth, but with leadership responsibilities.||As for Senior Youth, but with more leadership responsibilities than Senior Youth Squad Leaders.||An adult member between 18 and 25 that has undertaken a specific leadership course and is ranked above youth but below all adult ranks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cadet Leaders 18 to 25|url=http://cadets.stjohn.org.au/index.php/cadet-leaders-18-25|website=St John Cadets|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==== Youth officers ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Ranks and Insignia of [[St John Ambulance Australia|St John Ambulance]] (Youth officers up to [[States of Australia|State]] level)\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Officer Grade 6||Officer Grade 5||Officer Grade 4||Officer Grade 3||Officer Grade 2||Officer Grade 1\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off6.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off5.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off4.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off3.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off2.png|100px]]||[[Image:sjaa-rank-off1.png|100px]]\n|-\n|'''Notes'''||Youth Divisional Officer.||Youth Divisional Officer.||Youth Divisional Superintendent,<ref group=Note name=Note01/> <br> regional youth officer, youth liaison officer.||Regional youth officer, youth liaison officer.||State/Territory youth officer.||State/Territory Chief Officer (Youth).\n|}\nYouth 11 to 18 years of age.\nSenior Youth (Blue) from 15 years of age.\n\n== Australian Youth Advisory Network ==\nAYAN is the primary body within St John for communicating and consulting with and representing the views of young members (aged 12 to 26 years). \n\nAYAN aims to: \n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0communicate with young members in the places they hang out (e.g. on social media)\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0consult with young people nationally and understand their point of view \n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0represent young peoples\u2019 views to decision-makers in St John nationally \n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0help St John to achieve its goal of making first aid a part of everybody\u2019s life. \n\n==== How does AYAN connect with young people? ====\nAYAN use technology to regularly connect and engage with young people, advocating to and acting as a conduit to assist decision-makers to realise the goals of the organisation.

They were held on alternating years until 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 1985, the championships amalgamated when the girls and boys cadet groups joined. A two new categories were added, the Cadet Leader Individual and the Champion State/Territory, and the Ambulance and the Nursing trophies were reassigned to become singular team and individual Championships.\n\nAt this time, the St John National Champion badge was also introduced. Initially, it was only granted to the winners of the Cadet Team, Cadet Individual and Cadet Leader Championships, however, since 2003 it has been also granted to the winners of the Champion State/Territory, regardless of their rankings in their relevant events.\nEach year these competitions are held in January at the National Cadet Camp (NatCamp). In 2014, the camp and competitions will be held in New South Wales and will be an international camp with there being the National Championships but also the international competitions with countries invited to send competitors from all over the world where St John is established.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n== Code of Chivalry ==\nAll cadets and juniors are required to recite the Code of Chivalry at least once during their membership. Many divisions will recite the code at the beginning or conclusion of every meeting. The code originates from the historical origins of [[St. John Ambulance Australia|St John Ambulance]] \u2013 the [[Venerable Order of St John]].\n\nThe previous version of the code required cadets to 'serve God', but this was changed in the 1990s to 'serve my God' to avoid excluding those of no [[Agnostic|religion]] or those who are not [[Christians|Christian]].\n\nIt has eight major points, representing the eight points of the [[Maltese cross]] of the [[Venerable Order of St John]].<ref name=\"cadethandbook1\">St John Ambulance Australia.

''Youth Handbook 7th Edition''. 2019, p. 7.</ref>\n}}\n\n== Awards ==\nCadets have their own awards system, separate to adult members. These include both exemplary conduct and service awards. Awards are not worn on jumpers.<ref name=\"opsbranchuniform\"/>\n\n=== Exemplary conduct awards ===\nAwards for exemplary conduct may vary throughout Australia, but in most states/territories there is some form of 'cadet of the year' award, usually with one award for male cadets and one award for female cadets. They are awarded to recognise excellence in the cadet movement.\n\nDivisions may also have their own unofficial awards, which can vary.\n=== Grand Prior's badge ===\nThis is the second highest award that a cadet can receive and is awarded to cadets who have earned 12 proficiency badges, including the Knowledge of the Order Badge and the Family Care Badge. The first [[Grand Prior Award|Grand Prior's]] badges in the world were awarded in 1933 to three cadets \u2013 two from the United Kingdom and the other from Australia; Marion Higgins from [[Marrickville]] Cadet Nursing Division.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\nThe award is worn on the left sleeve for as long as the cadet remains a member of the Operations Branch \u2013 even if they become an adult.<ref name=\"opsbranchuniform\"/>\n\n=== Commissioner's badge ===\nSimilar to the [[Grand Prior Award|Grand Prior's]] badge, this award is the highest that any junior can achieve. It is awarded to juniors who have earned 10 interest badges and is worn on the right breast pocket of a shirt or battlejacket.\n\n=== Southern Cross Award ===\nThe Southern Cross Award is designed to provide a flexible framework of personal development and achievement for members aged 16 to 25. The activities are not predetermined\u2014youth members choose activities that are relevant to them. Youth members also set their own goals, work within their own time-frames and make their own decisions about what activities will help them achieve their award goals. \n\nTo complete this award youth members are required to progress through three levels: bronze, silver and gold, receiving a badge for each level completed. Each level has four subject areas. Youth members complete one activity from each of the subject areas for each badge moving progressively from bronze to gold. \n\nTo find out all about the award and download an application form visit [[:File:///\\\\\\\\STJNO-FS01\\\\company\\\\!Youth\\\\!NYG\\\\2019\\\\Youth Handbook Review 2019\\\\ayan.org.au\\\\opportunities|ayan.org.au/opportunities]].\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== The Sovereign's Award ===\nThe Sovereign's Award is the premier youth award in St John internationally. This is the only award to bear the personal signature of the Sovereign Head of the Order. It ranks immediately senior to the Grand Prior Award. \n\nThe Sovereign's Award is given to young members in recognition of outstanding work in three key areas: \u00a0\n\n1. personal development \n\n2. benefit to St John Ambulance Australia \n\n3. benefit to the community.\n\nThe format in which the candidate presents their final work may be of their own choice, but it must: \n\n* demonstrate a need for the project in the community \n* include a written summary or equivalent portfolio of work of the project that is of a high standard \n* where a written piece is submitted, include appropriate referencing/citation of any sources used \n* where a creative/non-written work is submitted, include a short explanatory piece on the project\u2019s purpose, how the idea came about/the need demonstrated in the community, its development over time and how it will be used to benefit the individual, community or St John \n* be finalised within a three-year period, but not less than 18 months, from the commencement date. \n\n=== Service awards ===\nCadets are able to attend public duties and treat patients within their [[Good Samaritan law|scope of practice]], provided that they are supervised by an adult. To acknowledge their contribution to St. John's work, a number of service shields have been developed. They include 100-hour, 200-hour and 500-hour service shields. In 1978, the Chief Commissioner introduced the Special Service Certificate, awarded to cadets who have completed at least 1000 hours of duties.<ref name=\"shorthistorystjohnp41\"/>\n\n=== Other awards ===\nMany other awards are available for cadets to wear and be awarded. These include external awards, such as the [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|Duke of Edinburgh's Award]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[St John Ambulance Australia]]\n*[[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK]]\n*[[St John Youth New Zealand]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note|refs=\n<ref name=Note01>Only applicable if the cadet division is not combined with an adult division.

[[Michigan]] has the second longest coastline of any state after [[Alaska]]. Being bordered by four of the five [[Great Lakes]]\u2014[[Lake Erie|Erie]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]], and [[Lake Superior|Superior]]\u2014Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds, as well as innumerable rivers, that may contain their own islands included in this list.  The majority of the islands are within the Great Lakes.  Other islands can also be found within other waterways of the Great Lake system, including [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], [[St. Clair River]], [[Detroit River]], and [[St. Marys River (Michigan\u2013Ontario)|St. Marys River]].\n\nThe largest of all the islands is [[Isle Royale]] in Lake Superior, which, in addition to its waters and other surrounding islands, is organized as [[Isle Royale National Park]].  Isle Royale itself is {{convert|206|sqmi|km2}}.  The most populated island is [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]] with approximately 10,000 residents, located in the Detroit River about {{convert|10|mi|abbr=off}} south of [[Detroit]].  The majority of Michigan's islands are uninhabited and very small.  Some of these otherwise unusable islands have been used for the large number of [[List of lighthouses in the United States#Michigan|Michigan's lighthouses]] to aid in shipping throughout the Great Lakes, while others have been set aside as [[nature reserve]]s.  Many islands in Michigan have the same name, even some that are in the same municipality and body of water, such as Gull, Long, or Round islands.\n\n==Lake Erie==\n[[File:Lake-Erie.svg|175px|thumb|[[Lake Erie]]]]\nOnly [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]] has territory in the westernmost portion of [[Lake Erie]], which has a surface elevation of {{convert|571|ft|abbr=off}}.  The islands in the southern portion of the county are part of the [[North Maumee Bay Archeological District]] of the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]].  [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] is the only island in the state of Michigan that is shared by another state. This remote and tiny island is cut in half and shared with [[Ohio]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! width=\"120pt\"| Island\n! width=\"140pt\"| Municipality\n! width=\"70pt\"| County\n! width=\"170pt\"| Coordinates\n! width=\"25pt\" class=\"unsortable\"|{{Abbr|Ref|Reference}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Gard Island (Lake Erie)|Gard Island]]\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.74861|-83.44361|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Gard Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=626627|name=Gard Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Indian Island (Lake Erie)|Indian Island]]\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.74722|-83.45361|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Indian Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=628982|name=Indian Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Smiths Island\n| [[Monroe Charter Township, Michigan|Monroe Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.87250|-83.36111|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Smiths Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=2438232|name=Smiths Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]]\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] / [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.75250|-83.39083|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Turtle Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=1615199|name=Turtle Island}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Lake Huron==\n[[File:Lake-Huron.svg|175px|thumb|[[Lake Huron]]]]\n{{main article|List of Michigan islands in Lake Huron}}\n[[Lake Huron]] is the second largest of the [[Great Lakes]] (after [[Lake Superior]]) with a surface area of {{convert|23,010|sqmi|km2}}.  [[Michigan]] is the only [[U.S. state]] to border Lake Huron, while the portion of the lake on the other side of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] belongs to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]].  The vast majority of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron are centered around [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Island]] in the northernmost portion of the state's lake territory.  Drummond Island is the largest of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron and is the second largest Michigan island after Lake Superior's [[Isle Royale]].  Another large group of islands is the [[Les Cheneaux Islands]] archipelago, which itself contains dozens of small islands.  Many of the lake's islands are very small and uninhabited.\n\nAs the most popular tourist destination in the state, [[Mackinac Island]] is the most well known of Lake Huron's islands.  Drummond Island is the most populous of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron, with a population of 992 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].  While Mackinac Island had a population of only about 500, there are thousands more seasonal workers and tourists during the summer months.\n\n==Lake Michigan==\n[[File:Lake-Michigan.svg|250px|thumb|[[Lake Michigan]]]]\n{{GeoGroupTemplate|section=Lake Michigan}}\nMichigan only has islands in [[Lake Michigan]] in the northern portion of the lake.  There are no islands in the southern half of Lake Michigan.

[[Michigan]] has the second longest coastline of any state after [[Alaska]]. Being bordered by four of the five [[Great Lakes]]\u2014[[Lake Erie|Erie]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]], and [[Lake Superior|Superior]]\u2014Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds, as well as innumerable rivers, that may contain their own islands included in this list.  The majority of the islands are within the Great Lakes.  Other islands can also be found within other waterways of the Great Lake system, including [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], [[St. Clair River]], [[Detroit River]], and [[St. Marys River (Michigan\u2013Ontario)|St. Marys River]].\n\nThe largest of all the islands is [[Isle Royale]] in Lake Superior, which, in addition to its waters and other surrounding islands, is organized as [[Isle Royale National Park]].  Isle Royale itself is {{convert|206|sqmi|km2}}.  The most populated island is [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]] with approximately 10,000 residents, located in the Detroit River about {{convert|10|mi|abbr=off}} south of [[Detroit]].  The majority of Michigan's islands are uninhabited and very small.  Some of these otherwise unusable islands have been used for the large number of [[List of lighthouses in the United States#Michigan|Michigan's lighthouses]] to aid in shipping throughout the Great Lakes, while others have been set aside as [[nature reserve]]s.  Many islands in Michigan have the same name, even some that are in the same municipality and body of water, such as Gull, Long, or Round islands.\n\n==Lake Erie==\n[[File:Lake-Erie.svg|175px|thumb|[[Lake Erie]]]]\nOnly [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]] has territory in the westernmost portion of [[Lake Erie]], which has a surface elevation of {{convert|571|ft|abbr=off}}.  The islands in the southern portion of the county are part of the [[North Maumee Bay Archeological District]] of the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]].  [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] is the only island in the state of Michigan that is shared by another state. This remote and tiny island is cut in half and shared with [[Ohio]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! width=\"120pt\"| Island\n! width=\"140pt\"| Municipality\n! width=\"70pt\"| County\n! width=\"170pt\"| Coordinates\n! width=\"25pt\" class=\"unsortable\"|{{Abbr|Ref|Reference}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Gard Island\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.74861|-83.44361|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Gard Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=626627|name=Gard Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Indian Island\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.74722|-83.45361|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Indian Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=628982|name=Indian Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Smiths Island\n| [[Monroe Charter Township, Michigan|Monroe Township]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.87250|-83.36111|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Smiths Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=2438232|name=Smiths Island}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|[[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]]\n| [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] / [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]\n| [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]]\n| {{coord|41.75250|-83.39083|region:US-MI_type:isle|name=Turtle Island}}\n| <ref>{{cite gnis|id=1615199|name=Turtle Island}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Lake Huron==\n[[File:Lake-Huron.svg|175px|thumb|[[Lake Huron]]]]\n{{main article|List of Michigan islands in Lake Huron}}\n[[Lake Huron]] is the second largest of the [[Great Lakes]] (after [[Lake Superior]]) with a surface area of {{convert|23,010|sqmi|km2}}.  [[Michigan]] is the only [[U.S. state]] to border Lake Huron, while the portion of the lake on the other side of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] belongs to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]].  The vast majority of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron are centered around [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Island]] in the northernmost portion of the state's lake territory.  Drummond Island is the largest of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron and is the second largest Michigan island after Lake Superior's [[Isle Royale]].  Another large group of islands is the [[Les Cheneaux Islands]] archipelago, which itself contains dozens of small islands.  Many of the lake's islands are very small and uninhabited.\n\nAs the most popular tourist destination in the state, [[Mackinac Island]] is the most well known of Lake Huron's islands.  Drummond Island is the most populous of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron, with a population of 992 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].  While Mackinac Island had a population of only about 500, there are thousands more seasonal workers and tourists during the summer months.\n\n==Lake Michigan==\n[[File:Lake-Michigan.svg|250px|thumb|[[Lake Michigan]]]]\n{{GeoGroupTemplate|section=Lake Michigan}}\nMichigan only has islands in [[Lake Michigan]] in the northern portion of the lake.  There are no islands in the southern half of Lake Michigan.  The largest and most populated of Michigan's islands in Lake Michigan is [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] at {{convert|55.8|sqmi|km2}} and 551 residents.  Some of the smaller islands surrounding Beaver Island are part of the larger [[Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
