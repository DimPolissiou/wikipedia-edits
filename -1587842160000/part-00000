The album followed the critically acclaimed compilation of their first three [[Extended play|EPs]] titled ''[[The Three E.P.'s]]'' (1998). With high anticipation for ''The Beta Band'', the band originally planned to record the album in four separate continents, but financial constraints slimmed the recording locations down; however, the album was still recorded in a variety of locations. The band approached creating the songs in a variety of ways, sometimes forming songs from single melodies, sometimes bringing together other strands of music, among other forms.\n\nThe album builds upon the experimental nature of their EPs, and is often seen as a particularly intricate, experimental and layered album, with a variety of different influences, sound effects, instrumentation and song structures. Based more-so around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into ''The Beta Band'' include [[psychedelia]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[blues music|blues]]. Vocalist [[Steve Mason (musician)|Steve Mason]] described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an [[ambient music|ambient]] bonus disc of two long compositions, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.\n\nUpon its release, the band made their dissatisfaction with the album public, infamously calling it \"fucking awful,\"<ref name=\"on-second\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |title=The Beta Band \u2013 The Beta Band \u2013 On Second Thought |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |last=Miller |first=Derek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104210/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |archivedate=6 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> largely blaming time constraints. Upon its release, it reached number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Critics were favourable towards the album, although many found the album particularly messy and disappointing after the EPs. In later years however, several critics have found the album to be underrated and have praised its ambitions.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, ''[[Champion Versions]]'', ''[[The Patty Patty Sound]]'' and ''[[Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos]]'', which were met with high critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |authorlink=Martin C.

Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite.

It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything,\" with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:\n{{quote|\"Each song starts differently, really. Some times it's a sample or a drum beat. Sometimes it's lyrics or a melody or something like that. It's different every time. [...] 'The Hard One' is a good example because we did something in a way we've never tried before. We don't really have songs where its verse and chorus, but the song has two verses and two choruses. Just to make it a bit more interesting we split everything up. We treated each section like a separate song. So the first verse was like one song. The second verse wasn't a copy at all and we tried to treat the choruses that way as well.

oddness retains its own peculiar allure.\"<ref name=\"regal-years\"/>\n\nDerek Miller of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' said that by the time the band split up in 2004, ''The Beta Band'' was widely considered to be \"unnecessarily difficult, a short side-step in the career of a remarkably talented band,\" but he felt the album had been long underrated and was due for re-evaluation, praising its unique sound and adding that it \"remains the broken-toothed step-child with a little bit of dander on the lip and a tangle of hair on its back, but Christ those eyes, so keen and full of mischief, forgive the ugly parts.\"<ref name=\"on-second\"/> ''Pitchfork'' founder Ryan Schreiber called ''The Beta Band'' \"the greatest acid-burnt full-length of the late 90s\", saying that although it \"took some getting used to, since half of its songs were, to put it gently, cracked,\" the \"densely layered electronic psychedelia\" songs proved the band as \"one of the few modern electronic-based bands capable of successfully splicing hundreds of self-created sources into huge, pastoral symphonies, grounded in both pop music and [[Salvador Dali|Dali]] [[surrealism]].\"<ref name=\"Schreiber\">{{cite

the official studio debut album of [[The Beta Band]], released in June 1999 by [[Regal Records (1914)|Regal Records]]. The album followed the critically acclaimed compilation of their first three [[Extended play|EPs]] titled ''[[The Three E.P.'s]]'' (1998). With high anticipation for ''The Beta Band'', the band originally planned to record the album in four separate continents, but financial constraints slimmed the recording locations down; however, the album was still recorded in a variety of locations. The band approached creating the songs in a variety of ways, sometimes forming songs from single melodies, sometimes bringing together other strands of music, among other forms.\n\nThe album builds upon the experimental nature of their EPs, and is often seen as a particularly intricate, experimental and layered album, with a variety of different influences, sound effects, instrumentation and song structures. Based more-so around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into ''The Beta Band'' include [[psychedelia]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[blues music|blues]]. Vocalist [[Steve Mason (musician)|Steve Mason]] described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an [[ambient music|ambient]] bonus disc of two long compositions, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.\n\nUpon its release, the band made their dissatisfaction with the album public, infamously calling it \"fucking awful,\"<ref name=\"on-second\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |title=The Beta Band \u2013 The Beta Band \u2013 On Second Thought |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |last=Miller |first=Derek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104210/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |archivedate=6 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> largely blaming time constraints. Upon its release, it reached number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Critics were favourable towards the album, although many found the album particularly messy and disappointing after the EPs. In later years however, several critics have found the album to be underrated and have praised its ambitions.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, ''[[Champion Versions]]'', ''[[The Patty Patty Sound]]'' and ''[[Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos]]'', which were met with high critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |authorlink=Martin C.

Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.\"<ref name=\"great-scots\">{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Jonathan|title=Great Scots, It's the Beta Band!|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/great-scots-its-the-beta-band-19990613|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 June 1999|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed \"the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist,\" and mentioned that the songs \"don't really tell a story. It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything,\" with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:\n{{quote|\"Each song starts differently, really. Some times it's a sample or a drum beat. Sometimes it's lyrics or a melody or something like that. It's different every time. [...] 'The Hard One' is a good example because we did something in a way we've never tried before. We don't really have songs where its verse and chorus, but the song has two verses and two choruses. Just to make it a bit more interesting we split everything up. We treated each section like a separate song. So the first verse was like one song. The second verse wasn't a copy at all and we tried to treat the choruses that way as well. Then we combined the songs together to make one song.\"<ref name=\"Hendrickson\" />}}\n\n[[File:Chris Allison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Chris Allison]] co-produced ''The Beta Band''.]]\nAccording to [[Steve Taylor (author)|Steve Taylor]] in ''The A to X of Alternative Music'', none of the songs were prepared before the band entered the studio, which is where they were \"determined to keep their manual looping techniques.\"<ref name=\"The A to X of Alternative Music\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Steve|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|date=27 September 2006|publisher=A&C Black|location=London|isbn=0826482171|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C&pg=PA32&dq=the+beta+band+1999&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCi5O3yvvRAhUFLcAKHUgQDFMQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&q=the%20beta%20band%201999&f=false}}</ref> The band's original intention for ''The Beta Band'' was for it to be a [[double album]] with each side of the LP recorded in a different continent, \"one in [[Tokyo]], one in [[Mexico]] and so on.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/> The band tried to plan this with their manager and Regal owner Miles Leonard, but ultimately Leonard dismissed the idea as impossible, \"it would have cost three-quarters of a million pounds or something and they would have lost the plot.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/>\n\nInstead, according to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', the album was at least partly recorded in a small hut belonging to Maclean's grandfather in a remote northwest part of Scotland, where the group found themselves with no room to sleep as they filled the hut with an excessive amount of musical equipment and homemade instruments.<ref name=\"space-jam\">{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Space Jammers|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=June 1999|volume=15|issue=6|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xY9xO99TYMYC&pg=PA114&dq=spin+the+beta+band&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZsp3qu_vRAhXEVhQKHW6hBPEQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=spin%20the%20beta%20band&f=false|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> [[Sawmills Studio]], [[Rockfield Studios]] and Jacobs Studio were also recording locations for the album.<ref name=\"MojoCollection\" /> In a 1999 interview, Mclean clarified that separate sections of the albums were recorded in different places: \"Four songs here, four songs somewhere else.

providing them with enough time or money to work on the album satisfyingly.<ref name=\"could-beta\"/>\n\nThe statements immediately caused tension between the band and their label; ''[[The

the band's manager, dismissed their complaints, calling them \"lame excuses\" as \"they had as much time as they wanted to have to make it, they were not forced to do anything they didn't want to.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/> However, he did admit that some of the financial constraints lead him to prevent the band's continental recording idea, but felt the album was \"nowhere near as bad as

critic Jason Ankeny thought that the album \"constantly runs the risk of collapsing into complete self-indulgence.\" Nevertheless, Ankeny further stated: \" In its way the Beta Band's genius is their

Beta Band'' as the group's most notorious release and felt it was the last known example of a \"group this strange\" signing to a major label and then using their new label to make even stranger music, especially when considering the abandoned ambient bonus disc. \"If the record violently vascillates between fascinating and frustrating on a song-by-song basis,\" he said, \"its over-arching oddness retains its own peculiar allure.\"<ref name=\"regal-years\"/>\n\nDerek Miller of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' said that by the time the band split up in 2004, ''The Beta Band'' was widely considered to be \"unnecessarily difficult, a short side-step in the career of a remarkably talented band,\" but he felt the album had been long underrated and was due for re-evaluation, praising its unique sound and adding that it \"remains the broken-toothed step-child with a little bit of dander on the lip and a tangle of hair on its back, but Christ those eyes, so keen and full of mischief, forgive the ugly parts.\"<ref name=\"on-second\"/> ''Pitchfork'' founder Ryan Schreiber called ''The Beta Band'' \"the greatest acid-burnt full-length of the late 90's\", saying that although it \"took some getting used to, since half of its songs were, to put it gently, cracked,\" the \"densely layered electronic psychedelia\" songs proved the band as \"one of the few modern electronic-based

It was published on [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]], an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Sat\u014d reached a deal with [[Dengeki Bunko]] and began releasing his work in a [[light novel]] format beginning July 2011. The story takes place in an [[alternate history]] where magic exists and is polished through technology, and follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, siblings who enroll into First High magic high school. While keeping their connections to the infamous Yotsuba clan secret, they attempt to live their daily life in peace where Tatsuya is shunned for his apparent ineptness and Miyuki is validated for her magical abilities.\n\nIn 2013, each [[story arc]] received a [[manga]] adaptation with varying [[manga artist]]s and publishers. That same year, an [[anime]] adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. ''The Irregular at Magic High School'' franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels and one of the manga adaptations are licensed by [[Yen Press]] while [[Aniplex of America]] licensed the anime series. The anime series was [[simulcast]]ed on four networks, and was later made available on [[Netflix]]. An [[The Irregular at Magic High School The Movie: The Girl Who Calls the Stars|anime film]] featuring an original story by Sat\u014d premiered in Japan on June 17, 2017, while a second season taking place after the anime series by [[Eight Bit (studio)|Eight Bit]] is scheduled to premiere in July 2020.\n\nThe series has been well received. The light novels appeared on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, is one of the top selling series in Japan with 10 million copies sold as of 2019. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, and poorly executed.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in a world with an [[alternate history]], where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the [[World War III|Third World War]], the world's [[superpower]]s shifted to these four nations: The [[North American Union|United States of North America]] (USNA), New [[Soviet Union]], the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians.

It was published on [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]], an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Sat\u014d reached a deal with [[Dengeki Bunko]] and began releasing his work in a [[light novel]] format beginning July 2011. The story takes place in an [[alternate history]] where magic exists and is polished through technology, and follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, siblings who enroll into First High magic high school. While keeping their connections to the infamous Yotsuba clan secret, they attempt to live their daily life in peace where Tatsuya is shunned for his apparent ineptness and Miyuki is validated for her magical abilities.\n\nIn 2013, each [[story arc]] received a [[manga]] adaptation with varying [[manga artist]]s and publishers. That same year, an [[anime]] adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. ''The Irregular at Magic High School'' franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels and one of the manga adaptations are licensed by [[Yen Press]] while [[Aniplex of America]] licensed the anime series. The anime series was [[simulcast]]ed on four networks, and was later made available on [[Netflix]]. An [[The Irregular at Magic High School The Movie: The Girl Who Calls the Stars|anime film]] featuring an original story by Sat\u014d premiered in Japan on June 17, 2017, while a second season taking place after the anime series by [[Eight Bit (studio)|Eight Bit]] is scheduled to premiere in October 2020.\n\nThe series has been well received. The light novels appeared on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, is one of the top selling series in Japan with 10 million copies sold as of 2019. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, and poorly executed.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in a world with an [[alternate history]], where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the [[World War III|Third World War]], the world's [[superpower]]s shifted to these four nations: The [[North American Union|United States of North America]] (USNA), New [[Soviet Union]], the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya's technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques cause people to view him as an irregular to the school's standardized rankings.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n;{{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Tatsuya Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u9054\u4e5f|Shiba Tatsuya}} and {{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Miyuki Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u6df1\u96ea|Shiba Miyuki}}\nTatsuya and Miyuki are siblings of the same school year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba;{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} their parents had a loveless [[forced marriage]], and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves.{{Ref|LN|LN 6.2}} Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the current leader of the Yotsuba Clan, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} Out of fear of his powers, the Yotsuba Clan leadership of that time argued for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation who would act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second was to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya warded off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joined the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by [[Major]] Kazama Harunobu.{{Ref|LN|LN 8.7}} At some point during his life Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the pseudonymous identity Taurus Silver.{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} He is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]].<ref name=\"Staff and Cast\">{{cite web| url=http://mahouka.us/staff/| title=Staff and Cast| publisher=Mahouka.Us| accessdate=October 2, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929154100/http://mahouka.us/staff/| archivedate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMiyuki is considered one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed her Aunt Maya as the leader of the Yotsuba Clan.

Religions and denominations differ on whether they permit religious remarriage.\n\n==Benefits and consequences==\n{{Main|Legal consequences of marriage in the United Kingdom}}\nUpon death of one's spouse, bequests to the other spouse do not incur [[inheritance tax]]. [[Intestate]] property by default will go to the spouse. Also, there is partial inheritance of pensions.\n\nIn courts, one spouse may not be compelled to [[testify]] against the other. Non-British spouses of British citizens may obtain [[residence permit]]s if the British spouse meets a minimum income requirement of \u00a318,600 per year. This rises to \u00a322,400 for families with a child, and a further \u00a32,400 for each further child. Spouses are considered to have a [[duty of care]] towards each other, and certain [[social security]] benefits are calculated differently from those for single people.\n\n===Foreign citizens wishing to marry in the UK===\nFrom 1 February 2005, visitors who wish to be married in the UK that are a citizen of a country that is not a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), must apply for a visa before they travel. Without the visa, the registrar will not be able to accept the notice of marriage and will not be able to perform the marriage ceremony.<ref>Until May 2011, persons already in the UK and a citizen of a country that was not a member of the EEA, needed the approval of the [[Home secretary|Home Secretary]] to be married. This was provided in the form of a certificate of approval. That programme was discontinued on 9 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIf one of the people wanting to marry is subject to immigration control, notice of marriage can only be done at a designated register office, which both parties must attend together. Marriage must be between two people neither of whom is in a Civil Partnership or separate marriage (foreign divorces are generally recognised; but an existing foreign marriage would prevent a marriage in the UK as this would be treated as [[bigamy]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Medieval period===\n[[File:Leighton-Call to Arms.jpg|thumb|An idealised medieval wedding imagined by [[Edmund Leighton]] (''Call to Arms'' 1888)]]\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], marriage was governed by [[canon law]], which recognised as valid only those marriages where the parties stated they took one another as husband and wife, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses. It was not necessary, therefore, to be married by any official or cleric. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) forbade [[Fleet Marriage#Irregular and clandestine marriages|clandestine marriage]], and required marriages to be publicly announced in churches by priests.\n\nFrom about the 12th to the 17th century, the practice of \"handfasting\" was widespread in England. It was a term for \"engagement to be married\", or a ceremony held on the occasion of such a contract, usually about a month prior to a church wedding, at which the marrying couple formally declared that each accepted the other as spouse.\n\n[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|Handfasting]] was legally binding: as soon as the couple made their vows to each other they were validly married. It was not a temporary arrangement. Just as with church weddings of the period, the union which handfasting created could only be dissolved by death. English legal authorities held that, even if not followed by intercourse, handfasting was as binding as any vow taken in church before a priest.<ref name=\"Nicholl\">Charles Nicholl, ''The Lodger: Shakespeare on Silver Street'', London, Allen Lane, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-713-99890-0}} Chapter 27, pp. 251\u2013258</ref>\n\nDuring handfasting the man and woman in turn would take the other by the right hand and declare aloud that they there and then accepted each other as man and wife.  The words might vary but traditionally consisted of a simple formula such as \u201cI (Name) take thee (Name) to my wedded husband/wife, till death us depart, and thereto I plight thee my troth\u201d.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Because of this, handfasting was also known in England as \u201ctroth-plight\u201d.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Gifts were often exchanged, especially rings:<ref>The rings might be plain \u2013 one was made on the spot out of a rush lying on the floor \u2013 or elaborate. They often had a posy engraved. One surviving example is a \"[[gimmal ring|gimmal]]\" ring, a double ring which twists apart to become two rings interlinked.  It is in the shape of two clasped hands and has the posy \"As handes doe shut/so hart be knit\". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=er-L6cizlRgC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22as+hands+do+shut%22&source=bl&ots=HnRY6PM7q4&sig=EanzigiuQ-vH8agUUFNLW5-BSPU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ax2-T_7TIILC0QWPmeQk&ved=0CFAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22as%20hands%20do%20shut%22&f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=5AXwFsTm1Z8C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22as+handes+doe+shut+so+hart%22&source=bl&ots=NW6ZH247M-&sig=RPNIeUEc_2H2IyQmT2W4vY3MJVo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4jAAUNzKKYXT0QX-2IWFBw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22as%20handes%20doe%20shut%20so%20hart%22&f=false]</ref><ref>Some rings incorporated \"memento mori\" devices, to remind the wearer the marriage was till death.  See Diana Scarisbrick, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', Tate Publishing, 1995. \u201c(Thomas Gresham's) wedding-ring has a twin 'gimmal' hoop inscribed in Latin 'Let not man put asunder those whom God has joined together', and beneath the ruby and diamond bezel there are cavities enclosing an infant and a skeleton alluding to the vanity of riches.\"</ref> a gold coin broken in half between the couple was also common. Other tokens recorded include gloves, a crimson ribbon tied in a knot, and even a silver toothpick.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Handfasting might take place anywhere, indoors or out.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> It was frequently in the home of the bride, but according to records handfastings also took place in taverns, in an orchard and even on horseback. The presence of a credible witness or witnesses was usual.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\nFor much of the relevant period church courts dealt with marital matters. Ecclesiastical law recognised two forms of handfasting, ''sponsalia per verba de praesenti'' (\"espousal by word given at the present time\") and ''[[sponsalia de futuro|sponsalia per verba de futuro]]'' (\"espousal by word at a future time\"). In the former \u2014 the most common form \u2014 the couple declared they there and then accepted each other as man and wife; the latter form was a  betrothal, as the couple took hands only to declare their intention to marry each other at some future date and could be ended with the consent of both parties \u2013 but only if the relationship was unconsummated. If intercourse did take place, then the ''sponsalia de futuro'' \"was automatically converted into ''[[de iure]]'' marriage\".<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, the [[Council of Trent]] legislated more specific marriage requirements, such as the presence of a priest and two witnesses, as well as promulgation of the marriage announcement thirty days prior to the ceremony. These laws did not extend to the regions affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Despite the validity of handfasting it was expected to be solemnised by a church wedding fairly soon afterwards. Penalties might follow for those who did not comply.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994. \"A public church marriage was necessary to ensure the inheritance of property\".</ref> Ideally the couple were also supposed to refrain from intercourse until then.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Complaints by preachers suggest that they often did not wait,<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> but at least until the early 1600s the common attitude to this kind of anticipatory behaviour seems to have been lenient.<ref>In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s 1604 comedy ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' a young man sleeps with his betrothed wife before his church wedding. Judged technically guilty of fornication, under puritanical laws he is condemned to die. The plot is driven by the need to rescue him, and audience sympathy is clearly expected to be on his side.</ref> Handfasting remained an acceptable way of marrying in England throughout the Middle Ages but declined in the early modern period.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994.  \"Between the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-seventeenth century the number of spousal actions in the church courts declined markedly, partly because of the increasing belief that the only proper form of marriage was one solemnized in church.\"</ref> In some circumstances handfasting was open to abuse, with persons who had undergone \"troth-plight\" occasionally refusing to proceed to a church wedding, creating ambiguity about their former betrothed's marital status.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] negotiated and witnessed a handfasting in 1604, and was called as a witness in a suit about the dowry in 1612 and historians speculate that his own marriage to [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway]] was so conducted when he was a young man in 1582, as the practice still had credence in Warwickshire at the time.<ref name=\"Nicholl\"/><ref>Shakespeare's Wife,  Germaine Greer, Harper Perennial, 2009, pg 108-110.</ref>\n\n===17th to 19th centuries===\n[[Image:FleetStreetMarriage 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Caricature of a clandestine Fleet Marriage, taking place in England before the [[Marriage Act 1753]]]]\n[[File:William Hogarth 023.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' depicting a wedding in the 18th century]]\nAfter the beginning of the 17th century, gradual changes in English law meant the presence of an officiating priest or magistrate became necessary for a marriage to be lawful.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History''.</ref> Up until this point in England, clergy performed many clandestine marriages, such as so-called [[Fleet Marriage]], which were held legally valid;<ref>In 1601 the poet [[John Donne]] married clandestinely in a private room where only he, his bride, his friend Christopher Brooke and Brooke's brother Samuel, a clergyman, were present. No banns were called and the bride's parents did not give consent; nevertheless, the bride's father did not later legally dispute the validity of the marriage. David Colclough, 'Donne, John (1572\u20131631)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7819, accessed 23 April 2012]</ref> and in [[Marriage in Scotland|Scotland]], unsolemnised [[common-law marriage]] was still valid.\n\nThe [[Marriage Duty Acts]] of 1694 and 1695 required that banns or [[marriage licence]]s must be obtained. The 1753 Act also laid down rules for where marriages were allowed to take place, whom you were and were not allowed to marry, the requirement for at least two witnesses to be present at the marriage ceremony and set a minimum marriageable age. This led to the practice of couples who could not meet the conditions in England and Wales [[Elopement (marriage)|eloping]] to [[Gretna Green#Marriage|Scotland]].\n\nLegal [[common-law marriage]] was, for practical purposes, abolished under the [[Marriage Act 1753|1753 Marriage Act]], also known as [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]]'s Marriage Act. This was aimed at suppressing clandestine marriages by introducing more stringent conditions for validity, and thereafter only marriages conducted by the Church of England, [[Quakers]], or under [[Jew]]ish law, were recognised in [[England and Wales]]. This effectively ended earlier practices.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994. \"From 1754...Pre-contracts (promises to marry someone in the future) and oral spousals ceased to have any force...\u201d</ref> Any other form of marriage was abolished; children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically [[Inheritance|inherit]] the property or titles of their parents.<ref>The term \"common law marriage\" is frequently used to describe mere cohabitation, but such a \"marriage\" is extremely rarely recognised in law; cohabitation does not generally confer any of the rights or obligations associated with marriage on the parties. It survives only in a few highly exceptional circumstances, where people who want to marry are unable to do so any other way and can simply declare that they are taking each other as husband and wife in front of witnesses - British civilians [[interned]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] who did so were later deemed to be legally married.</ref> For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland.\n\nThe [[Marriage Act 1836]] re-introduced [[civil marriage]], and also allowed ministers of other faiths ([[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s) to act as registrars. This act was contemptuously referred to as the \"[[Jumping the broom|Broomstick Marriage Act]]\" (a phrase which referred to a custom in supposed \"sham marriages\") by those who felt that a marriage outside the [[Church of England|Anglican church]] did not deserve legal recognition.<ref>''Jackson\u2019s Oxford Journal'' 12 September 1840, p. 1; ''Saint Valentine: or, Thoughts on the evil of Love in Mercantile Community: The Galanti Show'' (1843) 13 ''Bentley\u2019s Miscellany'' 151</ref>\n\nThe bill also proscribed certain [[affinity (law)|affinities]], such as the marriage of a man to his deceased wife's sister. Until this point, affinities had been largely formalised by those laid out in the \"Table of kindred and affinity\" in the [[Anglican]] ([[Church of England]]) [[Book of Common Prayer]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Wedding of Gwendoline Morris and William O Jones at Oswestry Parish Church (5348727405).jpg|thumb|Church wedding at [[Oswestry]], England, in January 1954]]\nThe list of proscribed affinities was reduced in the early twentieth century by the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]], and by subsequent amendments (the Deceased Brother's Widow's Marriage Act 1921 and the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Relationship Act 1931).\n\nThe [[Age of Marriage Act 1929]] increased the [[age of marriage]] to sixteen with consent of parents or guardians and 21 without that consent. It was passed in response to a campaign by the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/overview/lawofmarriage-/ The Law of Marriage], www.parliament.uk.</ref> Until this point, at common law and by canon law a person who had attained the legal age of puberty could contract a valid marriage. A marriage contracted by persons either of whom was under the legal age of puberty was [[Voidable marriage|voidable]]. The legal age of puberty was fourteen years for males and twelve years for females. This section amended the law so that a marriage contracted by persons either of whom was under the age of sixteen years was [[Void marriage|void]].<ref>Bromley and Lowe. Bromley's Family Law.

Any member of the royal family over the age of 25 who has been refused the sovereign's consent may marry one year after giving notice to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] of their intention to so marry, unless Parliament passes an act against the marriage in the interim. In 2005, the Queen consented formally to the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles]].\n\nThe royal family was specifically excluded from the Marriage Act 1836, which instituted civil marriages in England. However, Prince Charles's civil marriage raised questions. [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]] told the [[House of Lords (UK)|House of Lords]] that the 1836 Act had been repealed by the Marriage Act 1949, which had different wording, and that the [[British Government]] were satisfied that it was lawful for the couple to marry by a civil ceremony in accordance with Part III of the 1949 Act, and the [[Registrar General]] [[Len Cook]] determined that a civil marriage would in fact be valid. Any doubt as to the interpretation of the Marriage Act 1949 was put to rest{{dubious|date=November 2016}} by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which requires that legislation be interpreted in conformity with [[European Convention on Human Rights|convention rights]] wherever possible (including the right to marry, without discrimination).<ref>Under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], an English judge is not permitted to overrule an Act of Parliament but may only issue a certificate of incompatibility.  Thus, if the validity of Prince Charles' civil marriage to [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] had been challenged, a judicial proceeding likely would have been required, and Charles might not have been able to obtain relief except by an action in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Civil Partnership]]\n*[[English Law]]\n*[[Fleet Marriage]]\n*[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[Marriage Certificate]]\n*[[Marriage in Northern Ireland]]\n*[[Marriage in Scotland]]\n*[[Melltith]], a 200-year-old Welsh marriage custom.\n\n==References and sources==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n*[[Rebecca Probert]],  ''Marriage Law and Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009)\n* Anton, A.

Religions and denominations differ on whether they permit religious remarriage.\n\n==Benefits and consequences==\n{{Main|Legal consequences of marriage in the United Kingdom}}\nUpon death of one's spouse, bequests to the other spouse do not incur [[inheritance tax]]. [[Intestate]] property by default will go to the spouse. Also, there is partial inheritance of pensions.\n\nIn courts, one spouse may not be compelled to [[testify]] against the other. Non-British spouses of British citizens may obtain [[residence permit]]s if the British spouse meets a minimum income requirement of \u00a318,600 per year. This rises to \u00a322,400 for families with a child, and a further \u00a32,400 for each further child. Spouses are considered to have a [[duty of care]] towards each other, and certain [[social security]] benefits are calculated differently from those for single people.\n\n===Foreign citizens wishing to marry in the UK===\nFrom 1 February 2005, visitors who wish to be married in the UK that are a citizen of a country that is not a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), must apply for a visa before they travel. Without the visa, the registrar will not be able to accept the notice of marriage and will not be able to perform the marriage ceremony.<ref>Until May 2011, persons already in the UK and a citizen of a country that was not a member of the EEA, needed the approval of the [[Home secretary|Home Secretary]] to be married. This was provided in the form of a certificate of approval. That programme was discontinued on 9 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIf one of the people wanting to marry is subject to immigration control, notice of marriage can only be done at a designated register office, which both parties must attend together. Marriage must be between two people neither of whom is in a Civil Partnership or separate marriage (foreign divorces are generally recognised; but an existing foreign marriage would prevent a marriage in the UK as this would be treated as [[bigamy]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Medieval period===\n[[File:Leighton-Call to Arms.jpg|thumb|An idealised medieval wedding imagined by [[Edmund Leighton]] (''Call to Arms'' 1888)]]\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], marriage was governed by [[canon law]], which recognised as valid only those marriages where the parties stated they took one another as husband and wife, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses. It was not necessary, therefore, to be married by any official or cleric. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) forbade [[Fleet Marriage#Irregular and clandestine marriages|clandestine marriage]], and required marriages to be publicly announced in churches by priests.\n\nFrom about the 12th to the 17th century, the practice of \"handfasting\" was widespread in England. It was a term for \"engagement to be married\", or a ceremony held on the occasion of such a contract, usually about a month prior to a church wedding, at which the marrying couple formally declared that each accepted the other as spouse.\n\n[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|Handfasting]] was legally binding: as soon as the couple made their vows to each other they were validly married. It was not a temporary arrangement. Just as with church weddings of the period, the union which handfasting created could only be dissolved by death. English legal authorities held that, even if not followed by intercourse, handfasting was as binding as any vow taken in church before a priest.<ref name=\"Nicholl\">Charles Nicholl, ''The Lodger: Shakespeare on Silver Street'', London, Allen Lane, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-713-99890-0}} Chapter 27, pp. 251\u2013258</ref>\n\nDuring handfasting the man and woman in turn would take the other by the right hand and declare aloud that they there and then accepted each other as man and wife.  The words might vary but traditionally consisted of a simple formula such as \u201cI (Name) take thee (Name) to my wedded husband/wife, till death us depart, and thereto I plight thee my troth\u201d.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Because of this, handfasting was also known in England as \u201ctroth-plight\u201d.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Gifts were often exchanged, especially rings:<ref>The rings might be plain \u2013 one was made on the spot out of a rush lying on the floor \u2013 or elaborate. They often had a posy engraved. One surviving example is a \"[[gimmal ring|gimmal]]\" ring, a double ring which twists apart to become two rings interlinked.  It is in the shape of two clasped hands and has the posy \"As handes doe shut/so hart be knit\". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=er-L6cizlRgC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22as+hands+do+shut%22&source=bl&ots=HnRY6PM7q4&sig=EanzigiuQ-vH8agUUFNLW5-BSPU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ax2-T_7TIILC0QWPmeQk&ved=0CFAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22as%20hands%20do%20shut%22&f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=5AXwFsTm1Z8C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22as+handes+doe+shut+so+hart%22&source=bl&ots=NW6ZH247M-&sig=RPNIeUEc_2H2IyQmT2W4vY3MJVo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4jAAUNzKKYXT0QX-2IWFBw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22as%20handes%20doe%20shut%20so%20hart%22&f=false]</ref><ref>Some rings incorporated \"memento mori\" devices, to remind the wearer the marriage was till death.  See Diana Scarisbrick, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', Tate Publishing, 1995. \u201c(Thomas Gresham's) wedding-ring has a twin 'gimmal' hoop inscribed in Latin 'Let not man put asunder those whom God has joined together', and beneath the ruby and diamond bezel there are cavities enclosing an infant and a skeleton alluding to the vanity of riches.\"</ref> a gold coin broken in half between the couple was also common. Other tokens recorded include gloves, a crimson ribbon tied in a knot, and even a silver toothpick.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Handfasting might take place anywhere, indoors or out.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> It was frequently in the home of the bride, but according to records handfastings also took place in taverns, in an orchard and even on horseback. The presence of a credible witness or witnesses was usual.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\nFor much of the relevant period church courts dealt with marital matters. Ecclesiastical law recognised two forms of handfasting, ''sponsalia per verba de praesenti'' (\"espousal by word given at the present time\") and ''[[sponsalia de futuro|sponsalia per verba de futuro]]'' (\"espousal by word at a future time\"). In the former \u2014 the most common form \u2014 the couple declared they there and then accepted each other as man and wife; the latter form was a  betrothal, as the couple took hands only to declare their intention to marry each other at some future date and could be ended with the consent of both parties \u2013 but only if the relationship was unconsummated. If intercourse did take place, then the ''sponsalia de futuro'' \"was automatically converted into ''[[de iure]]'' marriage\".<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, the [[Council of Trent]] legislated more specific marriage requirements, such as the presence of a priest and two witnesses, as well as promulgation of the marriage announcement thirty days prior to the ceremony. These laws did not extend to the regions affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Despite the validity of handfasting it was expected to be solemnised by a church wedding fairly soon afterwards. Penalties might follow for those who did not comply.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994. \"A public church marriage was necessary to ensure the inheritance of property\".</ref> Ideally the couple were also supposed to refrain from intercourse until then.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> Complaints by preachers suggest that they often did not wait,<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/> but at least until the early 1600s the common attitude to this kind of anticipatory behaviour seems to have been lenient.<ref>In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s 1604 comedy ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' a young man sleeps with his betrothed wife before his church wedding. Judged technically guilty of fornication, under puritanical laws he is condemned to die. The plot is driven by the need to rescue him, and audience sympathy is clearly expected to be on his side.</ref> Handfasting remained an acceptable way of marrying in England throughout the Middle Ages but declined in the early modern period.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994.  \"Between the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-seventeenth century the number of spousal actions in the church courts declined markedly, partly because of the increasing belief that the only proper form of marriage was one solemnized in church.\"</ref> In some circumstances handfasting was open to abuse, with persons who had undergone \"troth-plight\" occasionally refusing to proceed to a church wedding, creating ambiguity about their former betrothed's marital status.<ref name =\"Nicholl\"/>\n\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] negotiated and witnessed a handfasting in 1604, and was called as a witness in a suit about the dowry in 1612 and historians speculate that his own marriage to [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway]] was so conducted when he was a young man in 1582, as the practice still had credence in Warwickshire at the time.<ref name=\"Nicholl\"/><ref>Shakespeare's Wife,  Germaine Greer, Harper Perennial, 2009, pg 108-110.</ref>\n\n===17th to 19th centuries===\n[[Image:FleetStreetMarriage 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Caricature of a clandestine Fleet Marriage, taking place in England before the [[Marriage Act 1753]]]]\n[[File:William Hogarth 023.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' depicting a wedding in the 18th century]]\nAfter the beginning of the 17th century, gradual changes in English law meant the presence of an officiating priest or magistrate became necessary for a marriage to be lawful.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History''.</ref> Up until this point in England, clergy performed many clandestine marriages, such as so-called [[Fleet Marriage]], which were held legally valid;<ref>In 1601 the poet [[John Donne]] married clandestinely in a private room where only he, his bride, his friend Christopher Brooke and Brooke's brother Samuel, a clergyman, were present. No banns were called and the bride's parents did not give consent; nevertheless, the bride's father did not later legally dispute the validity of the marriage. David Colclough, 'Donne, John (1572\u20131631)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7819, accessed 23 April 2012]</ref> and in [[Marriage in Scotland|Scotland]], unsolemnised [[common-law marriage]] was still valid.\n\nThe [[Marriage Duty Acts]] of 1694 and 1695 required that banns or [[marriage licence]]s must be obtained. The 1753 Act also laid down rules for where marriages were allowed to take place, whom you were and were not allowed to marry, the requirement for at least two witnesses to be present at the marriage ceremony and set a minimum marriageable age. This led to the practice of couples who could not meet the conditions in England and Wales [[Elopement (marriage)|eloping]] to [[Gretna Green#Marriage|Scotland]].\n\nLegal [[common-law marriage]] was, for practical purposes, abolished under the [[Marriage Act 1753|1753 Marriage Act]], also known as [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]]'s Marriage Act. This was aimed at suppressing clandestine marriages by introducing more stringent conditions for validity, and thereafter only marriages conducted by the Church of England, [[Quakers]], or under [[Jew]]ish law, were recognised in [[England and Wales]]. This effectively ended earlier practices.<ref>Anne Laurence, ''Women in England, 1500\u20131760: A Social History'', London, Phoenix Press, 1994. \"From 1754...Pre-contracts (promises to marry someone in the future) and oral spousals ceased to have any force...\u201d</ref> Any other form of marriage was abolished; children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically [[Inheritance|inherit]] the property or titles of their parents.<ref>The term \"common law marriage\" is frequently used to describe mere cohabitation, but such a \"marriage\" is extremely rarely recognised in law; cohabitation does not generally confer any of the rights or obligations associated with marriage on the parties. It survives only in a few highly exceptional circumstances, where people who want to marry are unable to do so any other way and can simply declare that they are taking each other as husband and wife in front of witnesses - British civilians [[interned]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] who did so were later deemed to be legally married.</ref> For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland.\n\nThe [[Marriage Act 1836]] re-introduced [[civil marriage]], and also allowed ministers of other faiths ([[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s) to act as registrars. This act was contemptuously referred to as the \"[[Jumping the broom|Broomstick Marriage Act]]\" (a phrase which referred to a custom in supposed \"sham marriages\") by those who felt that a marriage outside the [[Church of England|Anglican church]] did not deserve legal recognition.<ref>''Jackson\u2019s Oxford Journal'' 12 September 1840, p. 1; ''Saint Valentine: or, Thoughts on the evil of Love in Mercantile Community: The Galanti Show'' (1843) 13 ''Bentley\u2019s Miscellany'' 151</ref>\n\nThe bill also proscribed certain [[affinity (law)|affinities]], such as the marriage of a man to his deceased wife's sister.

Any member of the royal family over the age of 25 who has been refused the sovereign's consent may marry one year after giving notice to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] of their intention to so marry, unless Parliament passes an act against the marriage in the interim. In 2005, the Queen consented formally to the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles]].\n\nThe royal family was specifically excluded from the Marriage Act 1836, which instituted civil marriages in England. However, Prince Charles's civil marriage raised questions. [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]] told the [[House of Lords (UK)|House of Lords]] that the 1836 Act had been repealed by the Marriage Act 1949, which had different wording, and that the [[British Government]] were satisfied that it was lawful for the couple to marry by a civil ceremony in accordance with Part III of the 1949 Act, and the [[Registrar General]] [[Len Cook]] determined that a civil marriage would in fact be valid. Any doubt as to the interpretation of the Marriage Act 1949 was put to rest{{dubious|date=November 2016}} by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which requires that legislation be interpreted in conformity with [[European Convention on Human Rights|convention rights]] wherever possible (including the right to marry, without discrimination).<ref>Under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], an English judge is not permitted to overrule an Act of Parliament but may only issue a certificate of incompatibility.  Thus, if the validity of Prince Charles' civil marriage to [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] had been challenged, a judicial proceeding likely would have been required, and Charles might not have been able to obtain relief except by an action in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Civil Partnership]]\n*[[English Law]]\n*[[Fleet Marriage]]\n*[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[Marriage Certificate]]\n*[[Marriage in Northern Ireland]]\n*[[Marriage in Scotland]]\n*[[Melltith]], a 200-year-old Welsh marriage custom.\n\n==References and sources==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n*[[Rebecca Probert]],  ''Marriage Law and Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009)\n* Anton, A.
