Their middle child and eldest son, Charlie, is a deceptive and mischievous troublemaker, who is constantly plotting schemes to achieve his goal with his best friends, the equally-troublesome Alison and the moralled and more sensible Ben. Charlie's parents, Kevin and Helen, run the dysfunctional bed-and-breakfast and usually try to improve it in different ways, while his selfish, rude older sister Hannah is often trying to achieve a goal too, and his eccentric, gullible younger brother Louie believing a tale that will traumatize him and will try to conquer it. Each episode ends with Charlie complaining about his punishment by uttering his catchphrase \u2013 \"It's a travesty of justice!\" The only episodes that didn't end with this is the Series 1 Christmas special \"Murderer\" and the 2015 Christmas special \"Santa\". Although filmed with all the Series 2 episodes in the summer of 2014, \"Santa\" did not actually air until 2015, therefore not being part of Series 2. It was the final episode.\n\nIn September 2019 a boxset of the entire first series was made available on BBC iPlayer.\n\n==Main cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Cast list of ''All At Sea''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Series\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 1\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 2\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| Special\n|-\n| Ryan Wilkinson\n| Charlie\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Olivia Cosgrove\n| Alison\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Steve Edge]]\n| Kevin\n| (Voice Wayne Forester)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Nicola Stephenson]]\n| Helen\n| (Voice Tamsin Heatley)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Sam Hattersley\n| Ben\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Milly Zero\n| Hannah\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Adam Greaves-Neal\n| Louie\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Series\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired\n|-\n!

Their middle child and eldest son, Charlie, is a deceptive and mischievous troublemaker, who is constantly plotting schemes to achieve his goal with his best friends, the equally-troublesome Alison and the moralled and more sensible Ben. Charlie's parents, Kevin and Helen, run the dysfunctional bed-and-breakfast and usually try to improve it in different ways, while his selfish, rude older sister Hannah is often trying to achieve a goal too, and his eccentric, gullible younger brother Louie believing a tale that will traumatize him and will try to conquer it. Each episode ends with Charlie complaining about his punishment by uttering his catchphrase \u2013 \"It's a travesty of justice!\" The only episodes that didn't end with this is the Series 1 Christmas special \"Murderer\" and the 2015 Christmas special \"Santa\". Although filmed with all the Series 2 episodes in the summer of 2014, \"Santa\" did not actually air until 2015, therefore not being part of Series 2. It was the final episode.\n\nIn September 2019 a boxset of the entire first series was made available on BBC iPlayer.\n\n==Main cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Cast list of ''All At Sea''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Series\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 1\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 2\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| Special\n|-\n| Ryan Wilkinson\n| Charlie\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Olivia Cosgrove\n| Alison\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Steve Edge]]\n| Kevin\n| (Voice Wayne Forester)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Nicola Stephenson]]\n| Helen\n| (Voice Tamsin Heatley)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Sam Hattersley\n| Ben\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Milly Zero\n| Hannah\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Adam Greaves-Neal\n| Louie\n| (Voice Emma Tate)\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Series\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired\n|-\n!

He was imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].\n\nThe composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] wrote a musical piece titled ''Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk'' based on the journalist's diary ''Notes from the Gallows'' and meant it as a tribute to his resilience in the face of Nazi aggression.<ref>Marta, Nono's life, p.32</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJulius Fu\u010d\u00edk was born into a working-class family in [[Prague]]. His father was a steelworker, and he was the nephew and namesake of the composer [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]]. In 1913, Fu\u010d\u00edk moved with his family from Prague to [[Plze\u0148]] (Pilsen) where he attended the state vocational high school. Already as a twelve-year-old boy he was planning to establish a newspaper named ''Slovan'' (The Slav). He showed himself to be interested in both politics and literature. As a teenager he frequently acted in local amateur theatre.\n\n== Journalism and politics ==\nIn 1920 he took up study in Prague and joined the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party]], through which he was later to find himself swept up in the left-wing current. In May 1921 this wing founded the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (CPC). Fu\u010d\u00edk then first wrote cultural contributions for the local Plze\u0148 CPC newspaper.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Fu\u010d\u00edk found a position as an editor with the literary newspaper ''Kmen'' (\"Stem\"). Within the CPC he became responsible for cultural work. In the year 1929 he went to [[literary critic]] Franti\u0161ek Xaver \u0160alda's magazine ''Tvorba'' (\"Creation\"). Moreover, he constantly worked on the CPC newspaper ''[[Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo]]'' (\"Red Right\") and several other journals. In this time Fu\u010d\u00edk was arrested repeatedly by the Czechoslovak Secret Police, managing to avoid an eight-month prison sentence in 1934.\n\nIn 1930, he visited the [[Soviet Union]] for four months, including the Czechoslovak [[collectivist]] colony [[Interhelpo]] in [[Central Asia]], and painted a very positive picture of the situation there in the book ''V zemi, kde z\u00edtra ji\u017e znamen\u00e1 v\u010dera'' (\"In a Land, Where Tomorrow is Already Yesterday\", published in 1932). In July 1934, just after [[Adolf Hitler]] had suppressed the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], he visited [[Bavaria]] and described his experiences in ''Cesta do Mnichova'' (\"The Road to [[Munich]]\"). He went to the Soviet Union again in 1934, this time for two years, and wrote various reports, which again worked to support the Party's strength. After his return, there were heated arguments with authors such as [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Weil]] and Jan Slav\u00edk, who criticized developments under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Fu\u010d\u00edk took the Stalinist side and criticized such statements critical of Stalin as fatal to the CPC.\n\nIn 1938 Fu\u010d\u00edk married Augusta Kode\u0159i\u010dov\u00e1, later known as [[Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1]].\n\nIn the wake of the [[Munich Conference]], the Prague government disbanded the CPC from September 1938 and the CPC went underground. After [[Nazi Germany]]'s troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Fu\u010d\u00edk moved to his parents' house in [[Chotim\u011b\u0159]] ([[Litom\u011b\u0159ice|Litom\u011b\u0159ice District]]) and published in civilian newspapers, especially about historical and literary topics. He also started to work for the now underground CPC. In 1940 the Gestapo started to search for him in Chotim\u011b\u0159 because of his cooperation with the CPC, and so he decided to move back to Prague.\n\nBeginning early in 1941, he belonged to the CPC's Central Committee. He provided handbills and tried to publish the Communist Party newspaper ''Rud\u00e9 Pr\u00e1vo'' regularly. On 24 April 1942 he and six others were arrested in Prague by the [[Gestapo]], probably rather coincidentally during a police raid. Although Fu\u010d\u00edk had two guns at the time, he did not use them. The only survivor of the incident, Riva Friedov\u00e1-Krieglov\u00e1, claimed in the 1990s that Fu\u010d\u00edk had had orders to shoot himself to avoid capture.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/lupacr/79.shtml \u00c8esk\u00e1 redakce | BBC World Service<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bbc.co.uk</ref>\n\n== ''Notes from the Gallows'' ==\n[[File:notesfromthegallows.jpg|thumb|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk's ''Notes from the Gallows'' (first uncensored Czech edition, 1995)]]\n\nFirst, Fu\u010d\u00edk was detained in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]] in Prague, where he was also interrogated and tortured. In this time arose Fu\u010d\u00edk's ''Notes from the Gallows'' ({{lang-cs|Report\u00e1\u017e psan\u00e1 na opr\u00e1tce}}, literally ''Reports Written Under the Noose''), which was written on pieces of cigarette paper and smuggled out by sympathetic prison wardens named Kol\u00ednsk\u00fd and Hora. The book describes events in the prison since Fu\u010d\u00edk's arrest and is filled with hope for a better, Communist future. In later years its authenticity was contested. The book was published in a more \"acceptable\" version, from which the less pleasant passages, which did not quite fit into everyone's picture of heroic resistance fighters, had been stricken. After his death those letters were treated as great literary works itself. The notes translated in many languages all over the world.\n\n== Trial and death ==\nIn May 1943 Fu\u010d\u00edk was brought to Germany. He was first detained in [[Bautzen]] for somewhat more than two months, and afterwards in Berlin. On 25 August 1943 in Berlin, he was accused of [[high treason]] in connection with his political activities by the [[People's Court (Germany)|''Volksgerichtshof'']], which was presided over by the notorious [[Roland Freisler]]. Fu\u010d\u00edk was found guilty and was sentenced to death along with Jaroslav Klecan, who had been arrested with Fu\u010d\u00edk. Fu\u010d\u00edk was hanged two weeks later on 8 September 1943 in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in Berlin (not beheaded as is often stated).\n\nAfter the war, his wife, Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, who had also been in a Nazi [[concentration camp]], researched and retrieved all of his prison writings. She edited them with help of CPC and published them as ''Notes from the Gallows'' in 1947. The book was successful, and its influence increased after the Stalinist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948. It has been translated into at least 90 languages.\n\n== Fu\u010d\u00edk as an ideological symbol ==\n[[File:Memorial to Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk in Bautzen II.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk in [[Bautzen II]]]]\nThe Party found Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk and his book convenient for use as [[propaganda]] and turned them into one of the most visible symbols of the Party. The book was required reading in schools and by the age of 10 every pupil growing up in communist Czechoslovakia was familiar with Fu\u010d\u00edk's work and life. Fu\u010d\u00edk became a hero whose portrait was displayed at political meetings. Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 was given a high position in the Party hierarchy (the chairmanship of a women's organization), holding it for decades.\n\nMany places were named after Fu\u010d\u00edk, among them a large entertainment park in Prague (''Park kultury a oddechu Julia Fu\u010d\u00edka''), the city theatre in [[Jablonec nad Nisou]] (1945\u201398), a factory in [[Brno]] (''Elektrotechnick\u00e9 z\u00e1vody Julia Fu\u010d\u00edka''), a military unit, and countless streets and squares. In 1955, [[Milan Kundera]] published a poetic tale entitled ''Posledn\u00ed m\u00e1j'' (''The Last May'') that depicts an encounter between Fu\u010d\u00edk and his Nazi interrogators.\n\nThe [[MV Yulius Fuchik|''Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk'']] (''\u042e\u043b\u0438\u0443\u0441 \u0424\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043a'') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and later [[Russia]]n [[barge carrier]]. In Tom Clancy's 1986 novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'', about a hypothetical war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, this ship was given the role of being used for the Soviet invasion of Iceland.\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nThe position and reverence of Fu\u010d\u00edk during Communst Czechoslovakia is depicted by Milan Kundera in his book [[The Joke]] from 1967. There he describes how the portrait of Fu\u010d\u00edk hangs in public buildings where public expulsions from the Communist Party took place, and how Fu\u010d\u00edk's book is recited and used as propaganda by the Communist party.\n\n\"I recognized Fu\u010d\u00edk's Notes from the Gallows...That text, written clandestinely in prison, then published after the war in a million copies, broadcast over the radio, studied in schools as required reading, was the sacred book of the era.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kundera |first1=Milan |title=The Joke |date=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins Publisher INC |location=New York |isbn=978-0-571-16693-0 |page=189 |edition=First}}</ref>\n\n== Reassessment ==\nAfter the Party [[Velvet Revolution|lost its power in 1989]], the legend of Fu\u010d\u00edk became a target of scrutiny.

He was imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].\n\nThe composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] wrote a musical piece titled ''Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk'' based on the journalist's diary ''Notes from the Gallows'' and meant it as a tribute to his resilience in the face of Nazi aggression.<ref>Marta, Nono's life, p.32</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJulius Fu\u010d\u00edk was born into a working-class family in [[Prague]]. His father was a steelworker, and he was the nephew and namesake of the composer [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]]. In 1913, Fu\u010d\u00edk moved with his family from Prague to [[Plze\u0148]] (Pilsen) where he attended the state vocational high school. Already as a twelve-year-old boy he was planning to establish a newspaper named ''Slovan'' (The Slav). He showed himself to be interested in both politics and literature. As a teenager he frequently acted in local amateur theatre.\n\n== Journalism and politics ==\nIn 1920 he took up study in Prague and joined the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party]], through which he was later to find himself swept up in the left-wing current. In May 1921 this wing founded the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (CPC). Fu\u010d\u00edk then first wrote cultural contributions for the local Plze\u0148 CPC newspaper.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Fu\u010d\u00edk found a position as an editor with the literary newspaper ''Kmen'' (\"Stem\"). Within the CPC he became responsible for cultural work. In the year 1929 he went to [[literary critic]] Franti\u0161ek Xaver \u0160alda's magazine ''Tvorba'' (\"Creation\"). Moreover, he constantly worked on the CPC newspaper ''[[Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo]]'' (\"Red Right\") and several other journals. In this time Fu\u010d\u00edk was arrested repeatedly by the Czechoslovak Secret Police, managing to avoid an eight-month prison sentence in 1934.\n\nIn 1930, he visited the [[Soviet Union]] for four months, including the Czechoslovak [[collectivist]] colony [[Interhelpo]] in [[Central Asia]], and painted a very positive picture of the situation there in the book ''V zemi, kde z\u00edtra ji\u017e znamen\u00e1 v\u010dera'' (\"In a Land, Where Tomorrow is Already Yesterday\", published in 1932). In July 1934, just after [[Adolf Hitler]] had suppressed the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], he visited [[Bavaria]] and described his experiences in ''Cesta do Mnichova'' (\"The Road to [[Munich]]\"). He went to the Soviet Union again in 1934, this time for two years, and wrote various reports, which again worked to support the Party's strength. After his return, there were heated arguments with authors such as [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Weil]] and Jan Slav\u00edk, who criticized developments under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Fu\u010d\u00edk took the Stalinist side and criticized such statements critical of Stalin as fatal to the CPC.\n\nIn 1938 Fu\u010d\u00edk married Augusta Kode\u0159i\u010dov\u00e1, later known as [[Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1]].\n\nIn the wake of the [[Munich Conference]], the Prague government disbanded the CPC from September 1938 and the CPC went underground. After [[Nazi Germany]]'s troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Fu\u010d\u00edk moved to his parents' house in [[Chotim\u011b\u0159]] ([[Litom\u011b\u0159ice|Litom\u011b\u0159ice District]]) and published in civilian newspapers, especially about historical and literary topics. He also started to work for the now underground CPC. In 1940 the Gestapo started to search for him in Chotim\u011b\u0159 because of his cooperation with the CPC, and so he decided to move back to Prague.\n\nBeginning early in 1941, he belonged to the CPC's Central Committee. He provided handbills and tried to publish the Communist Party newspaper ''Rud\u00e9 Pr\u00e1vo'' regularly. On 24 April 1942 he and six others were arrested in Prague by the [[Gestapo]], probably rather coincidentally during a police raid. Although Fu\u010d\u00edk had two guns at the time, he did not use them. The only survivor of the incident, Riva Friedov\u00e1-Krieglov\u00e1, claimed in the 1990s that Fu\u010d\u00edk had had orders to shoot himself to avoid capture.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/lupacr/79.shtml \u00c8esk\u00e1 redakce | BBC World Service<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bbc.co.uk</ref>\n\n== ''Notes from the Gallows'' ==\n[[File:notesfromthegallows.jpg|thumb|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk's ''Notes from the Gallows'' (first uncensored Czech edition, 1995)]]\n\nFirst, Fu\u010d\u00edk was detained in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]] in Prague, where he was also interrogated and tortured. In this time arose Fu\u010d\u00edk's ''Notes from the Gallows'' ({{lang-cs|Report\u00e1\u017e psan\u00e1 na opr\u00e1tce}}, literally ''Reports Written Under the Noose''), which was written on pieces of cigarette paper and smuggled out by sympathetic prison wardens named Kol\u00ednsk\u00fd and Hora. The book describes events in the prison since Fu\u010d\u00edk's arrest and is filled with hope for a better, Communist future. In later years its authenticity was contested. The book was published in a more \"acceptable\" version, from which the less pleasant passages, which did not quite fit into everyone's picture of heroic resistance fighters, had been stricken. After his death those letters were treated as great literary works itself. The notes translated in many languages all over the world.\n\n== Trial and death ==\nIn May 1943 Fu\u010d\u00edk was brought to Germany. He was first detained in [[Bautzen]] for somewhat more than two months, and afterwards in Berlin. On 25 August 1943 in Berlin, he was accused of [[high treason]] in connection with his political activities by the [[People's Court (Germany)|''Volksgerichtshof'']], which was presided over by the notorious [[Roland Freisler]]. Fu\u010d\u00edk was found guilty and was sentenced to death along with Jaroslav Klecan, who had been arrested with Fu\u010d\u00edk. Fu\u010d\u00edk was hanged two weeks later on 8 September 1943 in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in Berlin (not beheaded as is often stated).\n\nAfter the war, his wife, Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, who had also been in a Nazi [[concentration camp]], researched and retrieved all of his prison writings. She edited them with help of CPC and published them as ''Notes from the Gallows'' in 1947. The book was successful, and its influence increased after the Stalinist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948. It has been translated into at least 90 languages.\n\n== Fu\u010d\u00edk as an ideological symbol ==\n[[File:Memorial to Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk in Bautzen II.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk in [[Bautzen II]]]]\nThe Party found Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk and his book convenient for use as [[propaganda]] and turned them into one of the most visible symbols of the Party. The book was required reading in schools and by the age of 10 every pupil growing up in communist Czechoslovakia was familiar with Fu\u010d\u00edk's work and life. Fu\u010d\u00edk became a hero whose portrait was displayed at political meetings. Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 was given a high position in the Party hierarchy (the chairmanship of a women's organization), holding it for decades.\n\nMany places were named after Fu\u010d\u00edk, among them a large entertainment park in Prague (''Park kultury a oddechu Julia Fu\u010d\u00edka''), the city theatre in [[Jablonec nad Nisou]] (1945\u201398), a factory in [[Brno]] (''Elektrotechnick\u00e9 z\u00e1vody Julia Fu\u010d\u00edka''), a military unit, and countless streets and squares. In 1955, [[Milan Kundera]] published a poetic tale entitled ''Posledn\u00ed m\u00e1j'' (''The Last May'') that depicts an encounter between Fu\u010d\u00edk and his Nazi interrogators.\n\nThe [[MV Yulius Fuchik|''Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk'']] (''\u042e\u043b\u0438\u0443\u0441 \u0424\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043a'') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and later [[Russia]]n [[barge carrier]]. In Tom Clancy's 1986 novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'', about a hypothetical war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, this ship was given the role of being used for the Soviet invasion of Iceland.\n\n== Reassessment ==\nAfter the Party [[Velvet Revolution|lost its power in 1989]], the legend of Fu\u010d\u00edk became a target of scrutiny. It was made public that some parts of the book ''Notes from the Gallows'' (around 2%) had been omitted and that the text had been \"sanitized\" by [[Gusta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1]]. There were speculations as to how much information he gave his torturers, and whether he had turned traitor. In 1995 the complete text of the book was published.
