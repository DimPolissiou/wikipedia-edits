Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. When Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later, drowning in the swimming pool at his home [[27 club|at the age of 27]].\n\nLong-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] said of Jones, \"He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential, very important, and then slowly lost it \u2013 highly intelligent \u2013 and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowman |first=Rob |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441 |title=Roll of a lifetime: Founding bassist Bill Wyman looks back at the Stones |date=27 October 2002 |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918152345/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441|archivedate=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLewis Brian Hopkins Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], on 28 February 1942.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=3}}<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\">{{cite book |last=Wyman |first=Bill |title=Rolling With the Stones |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-4646-2}}p. 10 & 16.</ref> An attack of [[croup]] at the age of four left Jones with [[asthma]] that lasted for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\" /> His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (''n\u00e9e'' Simmonds), were of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent. Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 and died on 14 October 1945 of [[leukemia]]; and Barbara, born on 22 August 1946.<ref>Wyman 2002, p. 10.</ref>\n\nBoth Jones' parents were interested in music: his father, Lewis, was a [[piano]] teacher in addition to his job as an [[aeronautical engineer]], and his mother, Louisa, played piano and [[organ (music)|organ]] and led the [[choir]] at the local [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\"/> In 1957, Jones first heard [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s music; this inspired his interest in [[jazz]].

He enjoyed [[badminton]] and [[diving (sport)|diving]] at school, and became first [[clarinet]] in the school orchestra. He reportedly obtained seven [[O-levels|O-level]] passes in 1957, thence continuing into the [[sixth form]] and obtaining a further two O-levels. He also took three [[A-levels]] in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], passing the first two and failing biology.<ref name=\"wymanp19\">Wyman 2002. p.19.</ref>\n\nJones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> However, he found school regimented, and disliked the school uniforms and [[conformism]] in general; he angered teachers with his behaviour, though he was popular with classmates.<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones himself said: \"When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend: \"He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/>\n\nIn late summer 1959, Jones' girlfriend (they were both aged 17), a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ride |first=Graham |title=Foundation Stone |year=2001 |isbn=1-904221-02-5 |pages=103\u20137}}</ref> Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an [[abortion]], she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David Corbett (later Simon) for [[adoption]].<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling for a summer through northern Europe. During this period, he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, [[busking]] with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.<ref name=\"wymanp28\">Wyman 2002. p. 28.</ref>\n\nJones listened to [[classical music]] as a child but preferred [[blues]], particularly [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. Jones began performing at local blues and jazz clubs, while busking and working odd jobs. He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, for which he was fired.<ref name=\"wymanp35-36\">Wyman 2002. pp. 35&ndash;36.</ref>\n\nIn November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in [[Guildford]] to see a band perform. He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy. Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby, Belinda, born on 4 August 1960. Jones never knew about her birth.<ref name=\"wymanp28\" />\n\nIn 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to [[Cheltenham Art College]]. He was initially accepted into the programme, but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college, calling Jones an irresponsible [[vagrant|drifter]].<ref name=\"wymanp29\">Wyman 2002. p. 29.</ref>\n\nOn 22 October 1961, Jones' girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child, Julian Mark Andrews.<ref name=\"wymanp30-31\">Wyman 2002. pp. 30&ndash;31.</ref> Jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the newborn. He lived with them for a while. On 23 July 1964, another woman, Linda Lawrence (later married to [[Donovan]]), gave birth to Jones' fourth child, Julian Brian Lawrence.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=93}} In early October 1964 an occasional girlfriend of Brian's, Dawn Molloy, announced to Brian and [[the Rolling Stones]]'s management that she was pregnant by him. She received a cheque for \u00a3700 ({{Inflation|UK|700|1964|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from group manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. In return, she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and that she would make no statement about Jones or the child to the public or the press.

Jones became a blues musician, for a brief time calling himself \"Elmo Lewis\", and playing [[slide guitar]]. He also started a group with Paul Jones called the Roosters. In January 1963, after both Brian and Paul left the group, [[Eric Clapton]] took over Brian's position as guitarist.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clapton |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Clapton |title=Clapton: The Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/claptonautobiogr00clapt |url-access=registration |edition=First |year=2007 |publisher=[[Broadway Books]] |isbn=978-0-385-51851-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/claptonautobiogr00clapt/page/40 40]}}</ref>\n\nJones placed an advertisement in ''Jazz News'' (a [[Soho (London)|Soho]] club information sheet) on 2 May 1962, inviting musicians to audition for a new R&B group at the Bricklayer's Arms pub; pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] was the first to respond. Later, singer Mick Jagger also joined this band; Jagger and his childhood friend [[Keith Richards]] had met Brian when he and Paul Jones were playing Elmore James' \"[[Dust My Broom]]\" with Korner's band at the [[Ealing Jazz Club]].<ref name=\"wymanp32\">Wyman 2002. p. 32.</ref> Jagger brought guitarist Richards to rehearsals; Richards then joined the band. Jones' and Stewart's acceptance of Richards and the [[Chuck Berry]] songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]] and Brian Knight, who had no tolerance for Chuck Berry.<ref name=\"wymanp35-36\"/>\n\nAs Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the \"Rollin' Stones\" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. \"The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?'

At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group [[Blues Incorporated]].\n\nWatts described Jones' role in these early days: \"Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]] and to be billed as an R&B band\".<ref>Jagger, Mick; Richards, Keith; Watts, Charlie; Wood, Ronnie. ''According to the Rolling Stones.''

Prior to his firing in 1969, on any instrument apart from the standard rock set up of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones was  the one playing it. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as [[Rickenbacker]], [[Gibson]], and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the [[open E tuning]] and [[open G tuning]].<ref>Paul Trynka interview with [[Dick Taylor]], early bass player for the Rolling Stones: {{cite web |last1=[[Paul Trynka|Trynka]] |first1=Paul |title=Open G tunings and open secrets |url=http://trynka.net/2014/08/open-g-tunings-and-open-secrets/ |accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\" (1963), \"[[I'm a King Bee]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\" (1964), \"[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]\" (1965), \"Doncha Bother Me\" and \"[[No Expectations]]\". Jones can also be heard playing [[Bo Diddley]]-style rhythm guitar on \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|I Need You Baby]]\" and on \"[[Please Go Home]]\", the guitar riff in \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\";<ref>{{cite web |author=Ian |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOLastTime.html |title=The Last Time |publisher=Timeisonourside.com |accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> [[sitar]] on \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\"; organ on \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\"; [[marimba]] on \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", \"[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]\" and \"[[Yesterday's Papers]]\"; [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] on \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and \"All Sold Out\"; saxophone on \"Child of the Moon\" and \"[[Citadel (song)|Citadel]]\"; [[kazoo]] on \"Cool, Calm and Collected\"; [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on \"I Am Waiting\" and \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", [[Mellotron]] on \"[[She's a Rainbow]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Stray Cat Blues]]\", \"[[2000 Light Years from Home]]\", and \"Citadel\"; and the [[autoharp]] on \"[[Ride On, Baby]]\" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in \"[[Dandelion]]\".\n\nJones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]\" (1963), \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" (1964), \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"Now I've Got a Witness\" (1964), \"Good Times, Bad Times\" (1964), \"[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]\" (1964) (from the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Five By Five''), \"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\", \"One More Try\" (1965), \"High and Dry\" and \"[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]\" (1966), \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\" (1966), \"Cool Calm and Collected\", \"Who's Been Sleeping Here\" (1967), and \"[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]\" and \"Prodigal Son\" (1968).\n\nIn the early years, Jones often served as a backing [[vocalist]]. Notable examples are \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\", \"[[Walking the Dog]]\", \"[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]\", \"I'm Alright\", \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\". He is also responsible for the whistling on \"Walking the Dog\".\n\nRichards maintains that what he calls \"guitar weaving\"<ref>[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view Rolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021141144/http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view |date=21 October 2013}}</ref> emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: \"We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five\".<ref>Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 39</ref> Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.\n\n===Estrangement from bandmates===\n[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], Shepard Sherbell, Jones and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (Amsterdam, 1967)]]\nOldham's arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow [[wikt:estrangement|estrangement]]. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and that playing [[cover version|covers]] would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, he wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more [[Jagger/Richards]] originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.<ref name=\"wymanp76\">Wyman 2002. p. 76.</ref>\n\nAccording to Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.<ref>Andrew Loog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 \u2013 300.</ref> When the first [[concert tour|tour]]s were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He \"resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up\".<ref>Oldham 2005. p. 210.</ref> The toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.\n\nIn March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to [[Morocco]],<ref>''Life'', pp. 198\u2013199</ref> further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' [[substance abuse]] increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s promotional film for ''[[We Love You#Promotional film|We Love You]]'', made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=161}}\n\nJones was arrested for [[drug possession]] on 10 May 1967, shortly after the \"Redlands\" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use, but claimed he did not use hard drugs.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=154}}\n\nIn June 1967, he attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] who were not yet well known in the [[United States]].\n\nHostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.<ref>Stanley Booth, ''The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (Canongate Books, 2012), p. 107.</ref> Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult.<ref>Richards and Fox, ''Life'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref> By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': \"There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.\"<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 83</ref> \"He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond\".<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 76</ref>\n\nJones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album. He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\".\n\nWhere once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part-concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].<ref name=\"rnrcircus\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend | title=Rock and Roll Circus |medium=commentary to the 2004 DVD release |publisher=ABKCO Films |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.<ref name=\"rnrcircus\"/>\n\n===Legal troubles and departure from the Rolling Stones===\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of [[cannabis]], which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Owing to his being on [[probation]], he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him \u00a350 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) plus \u00a3105 in costs ({{Inflation|UK|105|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn |UK |df=y}}) and told him: \"For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really ''will'' be serious\".<ref name=\"wymanp311\">Wyman 2002. p. 311</ref>\n\nJones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969, for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in a fit condition to tour, and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US [[work visa]]. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic. When he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was \"literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding\".<ref>Gary Herman, ''Rock 'N' Roll Babylon'' (Norfolk: Fakenham Press, 1982), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThis behaviour was problematic during the ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''Let It Bleed''. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home.<ref name=\"wymanp323\">Wyman 2002. p. 323</ref> In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> From this point, he was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: [[autoharp]] on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\" and percussion on \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at [[St. Katherine Docks]], [[Tower Bridge]], London and then at [[Ethan Russell]]'s photographic studio in [[South Kensington]]. The photos would appear on the album ''[[Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)]]'' in September 1969.<ref>\"Wyman\".\"Rolling with the Stones\" p.\"344\"</ref>\n\nThe Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for July 1969 in the US) they would start a tour of North America in November 1969. However, the Stones' management was informed that Jones would not receive a work permit, owing to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist. On 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Jagger, Richards and Watts, and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.<ref name=\"wymanp324-326\">Wyman 2002. p. 324-326</ref>\n\nTo the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that, \"I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting\".<ref name=\"wymanp326\">Wyman 2002. p. 326</ref> He was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist [[Mick Taylor]], formerly of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]].\n\nDuring the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at [[Cotchford Farm]] in [[East Sussex]], the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]],<ref name=\"teleg2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9258085/The-rock-n-roll-house-at-Pooh-corner.html |title=The rock 'n' roll house at Pooh corner |first=Christopher |last=Middleton| date=12 May 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed \"happier than he had ever been\".<ref name=\"wymanp329\">Wyman 2002, p. 329</ref> Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Stewart, [[John Lennon]], [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Alan Price]], and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] about intentions to put together another band.

His [[Swedish people|Swedish]] girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, at the age of 27. The coroner's report stated \"[[death by misadventure]]\", and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by past drug and alcohol abuse.<ref name=\"wymanp329\"/> However, during the [[autopsy]] doctors found that the cause of Jones' death was accidental drowning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/08/archive-brian-jones-death-1969|title=From the archive, 8 July 1969: Jones drowned while 'drunk and drugged'|date=2011-07-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nUpon Jones' death, the Who's Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled \"A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day\" (printed in ''[[The Times]]''), Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television, and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] published a poem titled \"Ode to L.A.

The band decided to dedicate the concert (which had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present their new guitarist, Mick Taylor) to Jones. Before the Stones' set, Jagger read excerpts from \"[[Adonais]]\", a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and [[stagehand]]s released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones' favourites, \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\".\n\nJones was reportedly buried {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep in Cheltenham Cemetery, to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters.

The journalist has also uncovered unseen police files held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour was leaving for work on the morning of Jones' death and saw a large [[bonfire]] on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> In 2010, following the review, Sussex Police stated it would not be reopening the case. It asserted that \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date= 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting credits==\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second \"[[Rice Krispies]]\" [[advertising jingle|jingle]] for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally.<ref name=\"wymanp90\">Wyman 2002. p. 90.</ref> Jones was also included in the \"[[Nanker Phelge|Nanker/Phelge]]\" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.\n\nAccording to Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after \"becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion\", but after two days of sessions \"the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists\".<ref>Oldham (2005). p. 288.</ref> In 1995, Mick Jagger told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: \"To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.\"<ref name=\"jaggerremembers\" />\n\nFaithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and presented it to the group. [[Victor Bockris]] reported that Richards and Jones worked out the final melody in the studio.<ref>Bockris, Keith Richards, Dutch translation, 1993, p.93-94</ref> Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Richards) for the instrumental piece \"Hear It\". However, in 1966, Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde [[Germany|German]] film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.\n\nThe only known released Jones song is \"(Thank You) For Being There\", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by [[Carla Olson]]. It appeared on the 1990 album ''True Voices'' as performed by [[Natural Acoustic Band#Krysia Kocjan .28Krysia Kristianne.29|Krysia Kristianne]] and [[Robin Williamson]].\n\n==Other contributions==\n[[File:Brian Jones guitar, HRC Sacramento.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jones' [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]], retired for display]]\nIn summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] ([[Jajouka]]), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as ''[[Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka]]''. Jagger and Richards visited [[Jajouka]] in 1989 after recording \"Continental Drift\" for the Rolling Stones album ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]] in [[Tangier]]. An homage to Jones entitled \"Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned\", painted by [[Mohamed Hamri]], who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967, appeared on the cover of ''[[Joujouka Black Eyes]]'' by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995.\n\n''Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka'' was rereleased in co-operation with [[Bachir Attar]] and [[Philip Glass]] in 1995.

The coincidence of their deaths at that age has been referred to in popular culture as the \"[[27 Club]]\".

Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. When Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later, drowning in the swimming pool at his home [[27 club|at the age of 27]].\n\nLong-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] said of Jones, \"He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential, very important, and then slowly lost it \u2013 highly intelligent \u2013 and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowman |first=Rob |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441 |title=Roll of a lifetime: Founding bassist Bill Wyman looks back at the Stones |date=27 October 2002 |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918152345/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441|archivedate=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLewis Brian Hopkins Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], on 28 February 1942.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=3}}<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\">{{cite book |last=Wyman |first=Bill |title=Rolling With the Stones |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-4646-2}}p. 10 & 16.</ref> An attack of [[croup]] at the age of four left Jones with [[asthma]] that lasted for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\" /> His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (''n\u00e9e'' Simmonds), were of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.

He enjoyed [[badminton]] and [[diving (sport)|diving]] at school, and became first [[clarinet]] in the school orchestra. He reportedly obtained seven [[O-levels|O-level]] passes in 1957, thence continuing into the [[sixth form]] and obtaining a further two O-levels. He also took three [[A-levels]] in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], passing the first two and failing biology.<ref name=\"wymanp19\">Wyman 2002. p.19.</ref>\n\nJones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> However, he found school regimented, and disliked the school uniforms and [[conformism]] in general; he angered teachers with his behaviour, though he was popular with classmates.<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones himself said: \"When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend: \"He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/>\n\nIn late summer 1959, Jones' girlfriend (they were both aged 17), a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ride |first=Graham |title=Foundation Stone |year=2001 |isbn=1-904221-02-5 |pages=103\u20137}}</ref> Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an [[abortion]], she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David Corbett (later Simon) for [[adoption]].<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling for a summer through northern Europe. During this period, he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, [[busking]] with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.<ref name=\"wymanp28\">Wyman 2002. p. 28.</ref>\n\nJones listened to [[classical music]] as a child but preferred [[blues]], particularly [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].

Jones never knew about her birth.<ref name=\"wymanp28\" />\n\nIn 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to [[Cheltenham Art College]].

Prior to his firing in 1969, on any instrument apart from the standard rock set up of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones was  the one playing it. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as [[Rickenbacker]], [[Gibson]], and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the [[open E tuning]] and [[open G tuning]].<ref>Paul Trynka interview with [[Dick Taylor]], early bass player for the Rolling Stones: {{cite web |last1=[[Paul Trynka|Trynka]] |first1=Paul |title=Open G tunings and open secrets |url=http://trynka.net/2014/08/open-g-tunings-and-open-secrets/ |accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\" (1963), \"[[I'm a King Bee]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\" (1964), \"[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]\" (1965), \"Doncha Bother Me\" and \"[[No Expectations]]\". Jones can also be heard playing [[Bo Diddley]]-style rhythm guitar on \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|I Need You Baby]]\" and on \"[[Please Go Home]]\", the guitar riff in \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\";<ref>{{cite web |author=Ian |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOLastTime.html |title=The Last Time |publisher=Timeisonourside.com |accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> [[sitar]] on \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\"; organ on \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\"; [[marimba]] on \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", \"[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]\" and \"[[Yesterday's Papers]]\"; [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] on \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and \"All Sold Out\"; saxophone on \"Child of the Moon\" and \"[[Citadel (song)|Citadel]]\"; [[kazoo]] on \"Cool, Calm and Collected\"; [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on \"I Am Waiting\" and \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", [[Mellotron]] on \"[[She's a Rainbow]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Stray Cat Blues]]\", \"[[2000 Light Years from Home]]\", and \"Citadel\"; and the [[autoharp]] on \"[[Ride On, Baby]]\" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in \"[[Dandelion]]\".\n\nJones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]\" (1963), \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" (1964), \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"Now I've Got a Witness\" (1964), \"Good Times, Bad Times\" (1964), \"[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]\" (1964) (from the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Five By Five''), \"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\", \"One More Try\" (1965), \"High and Dry\" and \"[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]\" (1966), \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\" (1966), \"Cool Calm and Collected\", \"Who's Been Sleeping Here\" (1967), and \"[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]\" and \"Prodigal Son\" (1968).\n\nIn the early years, Jones often served as a backing [[vocalist]]. Notable examples are \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\", \"[[Walking the Dog]]\", \"[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]\", \"I'm Alright\", \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\". He is also responsible for the whistling on \"Walking the Dog\".\n\nRichards maintains that what he calls \"guitar weaving\"<ref>[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view Rolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021141144/http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view |date=21 October 2013}}</ref> emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: \"We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five\".<ref>Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 39</ref> Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.\n\n===Estrangement from bandmates===\n[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], Shepard Sherbell, Jones and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (Amsterdam, 1967)]]\nOldham's arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow [[wikt:estrangement|estrangement]]. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and that playing [[cover version|covers]] would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, he wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more [[Jagger/Richards]] originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.<ref name=\"wymanp76\">Wyman 2002. p. 76.</ref>\n\nAccording to Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.<ref>Andrew Loog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 \u2013 300.</ref> When the first [[concert tour|tour]]s were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He \"resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up\".<ref>Oldham 2005. p. 210.</ref> The toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.\n\nIn March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to [[Morocco]],<ref>''Life'', pp. 198\u2013199</ref> further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' [[substance abuse]] increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s promotional film for ''[[We Love You#Promotional film|We Love You]]'', made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=161}}\n\nJones was arrested for [[drug possession]] on 10 May 1967, shortly after the \"Redlands\" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use, but claimed he did not use hard drugs.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=154}}\n\nIn June 1967, he attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] who were not yet well known in the [[United States]].\n\nHostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.<ref>Stanley Booth, ''The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (Canongate Books, 2012), p. 107.</ref> Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult.<ref>Richards and Fox, ''Life'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref> By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': \"There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.\"<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 83</ref> \"He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond\".<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 76</ref>\n\nJones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album. He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\".\n\nWhere once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part-concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].<ref name=\"rnrcircus\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend | title=Rock and Roll Circus |medium=commentary to the 2004 DVD release |publisher=ABKCO Films |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.<ref name=\"rnrcircus\"/>\n\n===Legal troubles and departure from the Rolling Stones===\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of [[cannabis]], which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Owing to his being on [[probation]], he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him \u00a350 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) plus \u00a3105 in costs ({{Inflation|UK|105|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn |UK |df=y}}) and told him: \"For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really ''will'' be serious\".<ref name=\"wymanp311\">Wyman 2002. p. 311</ref>\n\nJones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969, for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in a fit condition to tour, and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US [[work visa]]. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic. When he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was \"literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding\".<ref>Gary Herman, ''Rock 'N' Roll Babylon'' (Norfolk: Fakenham Press, 1982), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThis behaviour was problematic during the ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''Let It Bleed''. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home.<ref name=\"wymanp323\">Wyman 2002. p. 323</ref> In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> From this point, he was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: [[autoharp]] on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\" and percussion on \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at [[St. Katherine Docks]], [[Tower Bridge]], London and then at [[Ethan Russell]]'s photographic studio in [[South Kensington]]. The photos would appear on the album ''[[Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)]]'' in September 1969.<ref>\"Wyman\".\"Rolling with the Stones\" p.\"344\"</ref>\n\nThe Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for July 1969 in the US) they would start a tour of North America in November 1969. However, the Stones' management was informed that Jones would not receive a work permit, owing to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist. On 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Jagger, Richards and Watts, and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.<ref name=\"wymanp324-326\">Wyman 2002. p. 324-326</ref>\n\nTo the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that, \"I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting\".<ref name=\"wymanp326\">Wyman 2002. p. 326</ref> He was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist [[Mick Taylor]], formerly of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]].\n\nDuring the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at [[Cotchford Farm]] in [[East Sussex]], the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]],<ref name=\"teleg2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9258085/The-rock-n-roll-house-at-Pooh-corner.html |title=The rock 'n' roll house at Pooh corner |first=Christopher |last=Middleton| date=12 May 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed \"happier than he had ever been\".<ref name=\"wymanp329\">Wyman 2002, p. 329</ref> Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Stewart, [[John Lennon]], [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Alan Price]], and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] about intentions to put together another band. Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death, including \"Has Anybody Seen My Baby?\" and \"Chow Time\".<ref name=\"aeppli.ch\">{{cite web |url=http://aeppli.ch/TUG08/CDJonesUp.pdf |title=The Pipes of Pan |publisher=Aeppli.ch |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones - geograph.org.uk - 670236.jpg|thumb|right|Jones' grave in Cheltenham Cemetery]]\nAt around midnight on the night of 2\u20133 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm. His [[Swedish people|Swedish]] girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, at the age of 27. The coroner's report stated \"[[death by misadventure]]\", and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by past drug and alcohol abuse.<ref name=\"wymanp329\"/> However, during the [[autopsy]] doctors found that the cause of Jones' death was accidental drowning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/08/archive-brian-jones-death-1969|title=From the archive, 8 July 1969: Jones drowned while 'drunk and drugged'|date=2011-07-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nUpon Jones' death, the Who's Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled \"A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day\" (printed in ''[[The Times]]''), Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television, and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] published a poem titled \"Ode to L.A.

The band decided to dedicate the concert (which had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present their new guitarist, Mick Taylor) to Jones. Before the Stones' set, Jagger read excerpts from \"[[Adonais]]\", a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and [[stagehand]]s released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones' favourites, \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\".\n\nJones was reportedly buried {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep in Cheltenham Cemetery, to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters.

The journalist has also uncovered unseen police files held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour was leaving for work on the morning of Jones' death and saw a large [[bonfire]] on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> In 2010, following the review, Sussex Police stated it would not be reopening the case. It asserted that \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date= 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting credits==\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second \"[[Rice Krispies]]\" [[advertising jingle|jingle]] for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally.<ref name=\"wymanp90\">Wyman 2002. p. 90.</ref> Jones was also included in the \"[[Nanker Phelge|Nanker/Phelge]]\" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.\n\nAccording to Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after \"becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion\", but after two days of sessions \"the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists\".<ref>Oldham (2005). p. 288.</ref> In 1995, Mick Jagger told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: \"To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.\"<ref name=\"jaggerremembers\" />\n\nFaithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and presented it to the group. [[Victor Bockris]] reported that Richards and Jones worked out the final melody in the studio.<ref>Bockris, Keith Richards, Dutch translation, 1993, p.93-94</ref> Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Richards) for the instrumental piece \"Hear It\". However, in 1966, Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde [[Germany|German]] film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.\n\nThe only known released Jones song is \"(Thank You) For Being There\", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by [[Carla Olson]]. It appeared on the 1990 album ''True Voices'' as performed by [[Natural Acoustic Band#Krysia Kocjan .28Krysia Kristianne.29|Krysia Kristianne]] and [[Robin Williamson]].\n\n==Other contributions==\n[[File:Brian Jones guitar, HRC Sacramento.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jones' [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]], retired for display]]\nIn summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] ([[Jajouka]]), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as ''[[Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka]]''. Jagger and Richards visited [[Jajouka]] in 1989 after recording \"Continental Drift\" for the Rolling Stones album ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]] in [[Tangier]].

In contrast to most other [[Indo-European languages]], English does not retain [[grammatical gender]] and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el humano'') or grammatically feminine (as in [[French language|French]] ''la personne''), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in [[German language|German]] ''das M\u00e4dchen''), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.\n\nIn addressing [[Grammatical_gender#Natural gender|natural gender]], English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived [[Acceptance#Social acceptance|social acceptability]] of such strategies.\n\n==Debate==\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. \nMany people find non-neutral language to be offensive.<ref>{{cite web |last = Chappell |first = Virginia |title = Tips for Using Inclusive, Gender Neutral Language |work=Marquette.edu |date=2007 |url=http://www.marquette.edu/wac/neutral/NeutralInclusiveLanguage.shtml | accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic.

They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The ''their'' there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.<ref>{{harvp|Pinker |2000}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome [[style guide]]s {{which|date=April 2020}} accept singular ''they'' as grammatically correct,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage |last=Peters |first=Pam |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00pete_0 |ref= }}</ref> while others reject it.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\n<blockquote>\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\"\n</blockquote>\n\"If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been ''he has difficulties in childbirth''\", Miller and Swift comment.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=15}}</ref> Writing for the [[American Philosophical Association]], Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word ''man'' would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Virginia L. |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language |url=https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]] |accessdate=29 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302025159/https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |archivedate=2 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of ''man'' has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=492}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word ''men'' in its principal sense of ''males'', and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\"/>\n</blockquote>\nFor reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having ''man'' and ''men'' refer unambiguously to males, and ''human(s)'' or ''people'' to all persons;<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=493}}</ref> similarly, the word ''mankind'' replaced by ''humankind'' or ''humanity''<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=27}}</ref><!--\n\nIn gender-neutral language, when the description of defined genders has a practical need, the words \"Male and Female\" are often used as opposed to \"Men and Women\" in an attempt to make emphasis on the scientific features of male and female humans as opposed to cultural associations and baggage that may come with the words \"Men and Women\". {{clarification needed|date=January 2013}}-->\n\nThe use of the word ''man'' as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988\"/>\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Third-person pronoun#English}}\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine [[English personal pronouns|pronoun]] ''he'' (and its derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself'') to refer to antecedents of [[Grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|indeterminate gender]]. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The ''their'' there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.<ref>{{harvp|Pinker |2000}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome [[style guide]]s accept singular ''they'' as grammatically correct,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage |last=Peters |first=Pam |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00pete_0 |ref= }}</ref> while others reject it.

The city's original settlements, San Vicente de Balanac and San Guillermo de Dalangdang, were attacked by pirates and headhunters.\n\nIn 1759, Augustinian friar Jos\u00e9 Torres fused these two settlements to Pindangan (local word for a place to dry fish), where a church dedicated to San Guillermo the Hermit was located; this church is now the [[Cathedral of St. William the Hermit]]. The massive 1860s earthquake{{which|date=December 2019}} destroyed the church which was later rebuilt.\n\nAfter the formation of the province La Union, San Fernando became its ''cabecera'' or provincial capital in 1850.\n\nFrom 1896 until 1898, during the [[Philippine Revolution]], the Spanish garrison of San Fernando was attacked by Filipino insurgents under [[Manuel Tinio y Bundoc]] and Mauro Ortiz. Spanish administration ceased; a short while later, the United States acquired control over the country by the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] following the events of the [[Spanish-American War]].\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], the last battle of San Fernando was fought during the Japanese occupation at Barangay Bacsil. The Bacsil Ridge Monument was built on the site in the city, the north-eastern portion of the town plaza. The victory enabled the establishment of the United States Army Base, Base M at Poro Point (a buildup area for the Japan invasion).<ref name=\"LocalPHCom\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |title=Battle of San Fernando Marker in San Fernando (La Union) |website=localphilippines.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200236/http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |archive-date=2 June 2014 |access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> The town was liberated in 1945.<ref name=\"SanFernandoCityGovPH-History\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |title=History |website=Official Website of San Fernando, La Union |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127062703/http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |archive-date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Ilocanos are perceived to have been largely silent about the authoritarian practices and [[Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship|abuses of the Marcos administration]], <ref name=\"AtlanticDamagedCulture\">{{cite web| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028125710/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/11/a-damaged-culture/505178|title=From 1987: &#39;A Damaged Culture&#39; in the Philippines - The Atlantic|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Today\">Manila Today.

The city's original settlements, San Vicente de Balanac and San Guillermo de Dalangdang, were attacked by pirates and headhunters.\n\nIn 1759, Augustinian friar Jos\u00e9 Torres fused these two settlements to Pindangan (local word for a place to dry fish), where a church dedicated to San Guillermo the Hermit was located; this church is now the [[Cathedral of St. William the Hermit]]. The massive 1860s earthquake{{which|date=December 2019}} destroyed the church which was later rebuilt.\n\nAfter the formation of the province La Union, San Fernando became its ''cabecera'' or provincial capital in 1850.\n\nFrom 1896 until 1898, during the [[Philippine Revolution]], the Spanish garrison of San Fernando was attacked by Filipino insurgents under [[Manuel Tinio y Bundoc]] and Mauro Ortiz. Spanish administration ceased; a short while later, the United States acquired control over the country by the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] following the events of the [[Spanish-American War]].\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], the last battle of San Fernando was fought during the Japanese occupation at Barangay Bacsil. The Bacsil Ridge Monument was built on the site in the city, the north-eastern portion of the town plaza. The victory enabled the establishment of the United States Army Base, Base M at Poro Point (a buildup area for the Japan invasion).<ref name=\"LocalPHCom\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |title=Battle of San Fernando Marker in San Fernando (La Union) |website=localphilippines.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200236/http://www.localphilippines.com/attractions/1240/battle-of-san-fernando-marker |archive-date=2 June 2014 |access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> The town was liberated in 1945.<ref name=\"SanFernandoCityGovPH-History\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |title=History |website=Official Website of San Fernando, La Union |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127062703/http://www.sanfernandocity.gov.ph/city/history.php |archive-date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Ilocanos are perceived to have been largely silent about the authoritarian practices and [[Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship|abuses of the Marcos administration]], <ref name=\"AtlanticDamagedCulture\">{{cite web| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028125710/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/11/a-damaged-culture/505178|title=From 1987: &#39;A Damaged Culture&#39; in the Philippines - The Atlantic|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Today\">Manila Today.

Akkadian and its successor Aramaic, however, are only ever attested in Mesopotamia and the Near East.\n\nWithin the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] subgroup (with [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]]). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] or [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order. This novel word order is due to the influence of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] substratum, which has an SOV order.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAdditionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]]s ''ina'' and ''ana'' ([[locative case]], English ''in''/''on''/''with'', and [[dative case|dative]]-locative case, ''for''/''to'', respectively). Other Semitic languages like [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] have the prepositions ''bi/b\u0259'' and ''li/l\u0259'' (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.\n\nIn contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant [[fricative consonant|fricative]]: '''\u1e2b''' {{IPA|[x]}}. Akkadian lost both the [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian [[sibilant]]s were exclusively [[affricate consonant|affricated]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and writing==\n\n===Writing===\n{{Main|Akkadian cuneiform}}\n[[Image:AkkadischLand.png|200px|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform writing]] (Neoassyrian script)<br />(1 = Logogram (LG) \"mix\"/syllabogram (SG) ''{{IPA|\u1e2bi}}'',<br />2 = LG \"moat\",<br />3 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u02be}}'',<br />4 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|e\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|i\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|u\u1e2b}}'',<br />5 = SG ''kam'',<br />6 = SG ''im'',<br />7 = SG ''bir'')]]\nOld Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c. 2500 BC. It was written using [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[logogram]]s (''i.e.'', picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) [[phonetic complement]]s. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged [[Syllabary|syllabic script]], and the original [[Logogram|logographic]] nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign ''AN'' can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ''ilum'' ('god') and on the other signify the god [[Anu]] or even the syllable ''-an-''. Additionally, this sign was used as a [[determinative]] for divine names.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ''{{transl|sem|A\u1e2a}}'', do not distinguish between the different [[vowel]] qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ''{{transl|sem|-\u0161a-}}'', for example, is rendered by the sign ''{{transl|sem|\u0160A}}'', but also by the sign ''{{transl|sem|N\u012a\u011c}}''. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.\n\nCuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important [[phonemes]] in Semitic, including a [[glottal stop]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and [[emphatic consonant]]s. In addition, cuneiform was a [[syllabary]] writing system\u2014i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit\u2014frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).\n\n===Development===\nAkkadian is divided into several [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] based on [[geography]] and [[historical period]]:<ref>Caplice, p.5 (1980)</ref>\n*Old Akkadian, 2500\u20131950 BC\n*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950\u20131530 BC\n*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530\u20131000 BC\n*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000\u2013600 BC\n*Late Babylonian, 600 BC\u2013100 AD\n[[File:Antiochus cylinder.jpg|thumb|left|Cylinder of Hellenistic king [[Antiochus I]] (r.281\u2013261 BC), as great king of kings of [[Babylon]], restorer of gods [[Esagila|E-sagila]] and [[E-zida]].

During the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.\n\nOld Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect [[Mari, Syria|Mariotic]], is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related [[Eblaite language]]. For this reason, forms like ''lu-prus'' ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older ''la-prus''. While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the \"Assyrian [[vowel harmony]]\". Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and a [[relative pronoun]] declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Akkadian have been recovered from the [[K\u00fcltepe]] site in [[Anatolia]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.<ref>K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}</ref>\n\nOld Babylonian was the language of king [[Hammurabi]] and his [[Code of Hammurabi|code]], which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].) The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire [[Ancient Near East]], including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from [[Northwest Semitic languages]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.\n\nMiddle Assyrian served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in much of the [[Ancient Near East]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] ([[Amarna Period]]). During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by [[Old Aramaic]]. Under the [[Achaemenids]], Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the [[Hellenistic period]] when it was further marginalized by [[Koine Greek]], even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunger |first1=Hermann |last2=de Jong |first2=Teije |title=Almanac W22340a From Uruk: The Latest Datable Cuneiform Tablet |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie |date=30 January 2014 |volume=104 |issue=2 |doi=10.1515/za-2014-0015}}</ref> However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=C.

From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.\n\nDuring the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a ''lingua franca''. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and [[Aramaic]] were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of [[Neo-Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]]. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction in 612 BC. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a ''lingua franca''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejongjul.org/archive/view_article?pid=jul-5-1-1|title=Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538-333 B.C.E.)|last=Bae|first=Chul-hyun|date=2004|website=Journal of Universal Language|doi=10.22425/jul.2004.5.1.1|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian.\n\nAfter the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which were conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.  The last positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD.<ref>John Huehnergard & Christopher Woods, 2004 \"Akkadian and Eblaite\", ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'', pg. 218.</ref>\n\n===Decipherment===\n[[File:Georg Friedrich Grotefend.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 275\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Edward Hincks.jpg\n | width1            = 600\n | height1           = 728\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Edward Hincks]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Henry Creswicke Rawlinson.jpg\n | width2            = 1274\n | height2           = 1600\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]]\n}}\nThe Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when [[Carsten Niebuhr]] in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from [[Edward Hincks]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Jules Oppert]] in the middle of the 19th century.  The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago recently completed a 21-volume dictionary of the Akkadian language, which is available commercially and [http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad online].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13715296 | title=Dictionary 90 years in the making| work=BBC News| date=2011-06-14| last1=Hebblethwaite| first1=Cordelia}}</ref>\n[[Image:GilgameshTablet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] tablet of the [[Gilgamesh]] epic in Akkadian.]]\n\n===Dialects===\nThe following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian identified with certainty so far.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Known Akkadian dialects\n !

Sommerfeld 2003) believe that the Old Akkadian variant used in the older texts is not an ancestor of the later Assyrian and Babylonian dialects, but rather a separate dialect that was replaced by these two dialects and which died out early.\n\n[[Eblaite language|Eblaite]], formerly thought of as yet another Akkadian dialect, is now generally considered a separate East Semitic language.\n\n==Phonetics and phonology==\n{{anchor|Phonology}}\nBecause Akkadian as a spoken language is extinct and no contemporary descriptions of the pronunciation are known, little can be said with certainty about the [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of Akkadian. Some conclusions can be made, however, due to the relationship to the other [[Semitic language]]s and variant spellings of Akkadian words.\n\n===Consonants===\n\nThe following table gives the [[consonant]] sounds distinguished in the Akkadian use of cuneiform, with the presumed pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription according to Huehnergard and Woods,<ref name=\":0\" /> which most closely corresponds to recent reconstructions of [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic phonology]]. The parenthesised symbol following is the transcription used in the literature, in the cases where that symbol is different from the phonetic symbol.

For the sibilants, traditionally /\u0161/ has been held to be postalveolar {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and /s/, /z/, /{{transl|sem|\u1e63}}/ analyzed as fricatives; but attested [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] in Akkadian suggest otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\". In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68.</ref> For example, when the possessive suffix ''-\u0161u'' is added to the root ''awat'' ('word'), it is written ''awassu'' ('his word') even though ''\u0161\u0161'' would be expected. The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from ''t\u0161'' to ''ss'' is that /s, \u1e63/ form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s t\u0361s\u02bc]}}, *\u0161 is a voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|[s]}}, and *z is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative {{IPA|[d\u0361z~z]}}. The assimilation is then [awat+su] > {{IPA|[awatt\u0361su]}}. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *\u0161 is *s\u0320, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible, however. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} could have been assimilated to the preceding {{IPA|[t]}}, yielding {{IPA|[ts]}}, which would later have been simplified to {{IPA|[ss]}}.\n\nThe phoneme /r/ has traditionally been interpreted as a trill but its pattern of alternation with /{{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e2b}}/ suggests it was a velar (or uvular) fricative. In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian /r/ was transcribed using the Greek \u03c1, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]] (though Greeks may also have perceived a [[uvular trill]] as \u03c1).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Descent from Proto-Semitic ===\nSeveral [[Proto-Semitic]] phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop {{transl|sem|[[Aleph (letter)|*\u02be]], as well as the fricatives [[Ayin|*\u02bf]]}}, {{transl|sem|[[He (letter)|*h]], [[Heth (letter)|*\u1e25]]}} are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality ''e'' not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The [[voiceless lateral fricatives]] ({{transl|sem|[[\u015aawt|*\u015b]], [[\u1e0c\u0101d|*\u1e63\u0301]]}}) merged with the sibilants as in [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], leaving 19 consonantal phonemes.

(section on vowels and semi-vowels)</ref> There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Akkadian and Eblaite|url = https://www.academia.edu/6933497|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19|last = Huehnergard & Woods|page = 233}}</ref>\n\nAll consonants and [[vowel]]s appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are represented in writing as double consonants, and long vowels are written with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u016b). This distinction is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and is used in the grammar, for example ''iprusu'' ('that he decided') versus ''iprus\u016b'' ('they decided').\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns of Akkadian are disputed, with some authors claiming that nothing is known of the topic. There are however certain points of reference, such as the rule of vowel syncope, and some forms in the cuneiform that might represent the stressing of certain vowels; however, attempts at identifying a rule for stress have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nHuenergard (2005:3-4) claims that stress in Akkadian is completely predictable. In his syllable typology there are three syllable weights: ''light'' (V, CV); ''heavy'' (CVC, CV\u0304, CV\u0302), and ''superheavy'' (CV\u0302C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed.\n\nA rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is ''PaRiS-''. Thus the masculine singular nominative is ''PaRS-um'' (< ''*PaRiS-um'') but the feminine singular nominative is ''PaRiStum'' (< ''*PaRiS-at-um''). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Consonantal root====\nMost roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants (called the radicals), but some roots are composed of four consonants (so-called quadriradicals). The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example ''PRS'' (to decide). Between and around these radicals various [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[prefix]]es, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. Also, the middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription (and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself).\n\nThe consonants ''{{IPA|\u0294}}'', ''{{IPA|w}}'', ''{{IPA|j}}'' and ''{{IPA|n}}'' are termed \"weak radicals\" and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.\n\n==== Case, number and gender ====\nFormally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]]). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.), and adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single [[oblique case]].\n\nAkkadian, unlike [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but like [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], has only \"sound\" plurals formed by means of a plural ending (i.e. no [[broken plurals]] formed by changing the word stem). As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (''-\u0101t'').\n\nThe nouns ''\u0161arrum'' (king) and ''\u0161arratum'' (queen) and the adjective ''dannum'' (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Noun and adjective paradigms\n !\n !

Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in ''-um'' in the singular and the resulting forms serve as [[adverbial]]s. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the ''um''-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition ''ina''.\n\nIn the later stages of Akkadian the [[mimation]] (word-final ''-m'') - along with [[nunation]] (dual final \"-n\") - that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to ''-u'' and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings (although often sporadically and incorrectly). As the most important [[Language contact|contact language]] throughout this period was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomenon.\n\n====Noun states and nominal sentences====\nAs is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of \"states\" depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the ''status rectus'' (the [[governed state]]), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the ''status absolutus'' (the [[absolute state]]) and the ''status constructus'' ([[Construct state]]). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.\n\nThe status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. ''aw\u012bl'' < ''aw\u012blum'', ''\u0161ar'' < ''\u0161arrum''). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.\n\n(1) ''Aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161\u016b'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr\u0101q.''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | he <small>(3rd masc. personal pronoun)</small> || Align=\"right\" | thief (status absolutus)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' This man is a thief\n\n(2) ''\u0161arrum l\u0101 \u0161an\u0101n''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''l\u0101'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161an\u0101n.''\n|-\n| King <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | not <small>(negative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | oppose <small>(verbal infinitive, status absolutus)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king who cannot be rivaled\n\nThe status constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the ''shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible''. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:\n\n(3) ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n|-\n| Son (status constructus) + his <small>(3rd person singular possessive pronoun) </small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' His son, its (masculine) son\n\nbut\n\n(4) ''m\u0101r \u0161arr-im''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101r'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-im''\n|-\n| Son (Status constructus) || king (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king's son\n\nThere are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like ''kalbum'' (dog) and ''ma\u1e2brum'' (front) would have illegal construct state forms ''*kalb'' and ''*ma\u1e2br'' unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. ''kalab'', ''ma\u1e2bar''). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ''\u0161aknum'' < ''*\u0161akinum'' \"governor\"). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so ''\u0161aknum'' yields ''\u0161akin'').\n\n(5) ''kalab belim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''kalab'' || Align=\"center\" | ''bel-im''\n|-\n| dog (Status constructus) || master (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The master's dog\n\n(6) ''\u0161akin \u0101lim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161akin'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0101l-im''\n|-\n| Governor (Status constructus) || city (genitive singular)\n|}\n\nA genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ''\u0161a'', and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.\n\n(7) sal\u012bm\u0101tum \u0161a aw\u012bl E\u0161nunna\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''sal\u012bm\u0101tum'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''aw\u012bl''|| Align=\"center\" | ''E\u0161nunna''\n|-\n| Alliances <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | which <small>(relative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | man <small>(status constructus)</small> || Align=\"right\" | E\u0161nunna <small>(genitive, unmarked)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The alliances of the Ruler of E\u0161nunna (literally \"Alliances which man of E\u0161nunna (has)\")\n\nThe same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.\n\n(7) ''aw\u012bl-um \u0161a m\u0101t-am i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101t-am'' || Align=\"center\" | ''i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | that <small>(relative pronoun)</small> || Align=\"center\" | land (singular, accusative) || Align=\"center\" | 3rd person - conquer (preterite) - singular, masculine - subjunctive\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The man who conquered the land\n\n====Verbal morphology====\n\n=====Verb aspects=====\nThe Akkadian verb has six [[Finite verb|finite]] [[Grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] ([[preterite]],  [[Perfective|perfect]], [[present tense|present]], [[imperative (grammar)|imperative]], [[Irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] and [[vetitive]]) and three [[Non-finite verb|infinite]] forms ([[infinitive]], [[participle]] and [[Non-finite verb|verbal adjective]]). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Imperative mood#Indicative and prohibitive mood|prohibitive]], formed by the present form of the verb and the negative [[adverb]] l\u0101, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a [[verbal noun]], and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in [[grammatical case|case]]. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the [[semantics]] of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the [[English gerund]].\n\nThe following table shows the conjugation of the [[Derived stem|G-stem]] verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!\n!

The subjunctive is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix -u (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives), but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost\n#[[Ventive|Venitive]] or [[allative]]. The venitive is not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the 1st person dative pronominal suffix -am/-m/-nim. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion towards an object or person (e.g. ''illik'', \"he went\" vs. ''illikam'', \"he came\"). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\",\"to separate\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

[[Ventive|Venitive]]\n| ''iprusam'' || ''parsam''\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t4}}\n\n=====Verb patterns=====\nAkkadian verbs have thirteen separate [[derived stem]]s formed on each [[Triliteral|root]]. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning \"basic stem\"). [[Causative]] or [[intensive]] forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The \u0160-stem is formed by adding a prefix ''\u0161-'', and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a ''n-'' prefix. However the ''n-'' element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.\n\nFurthermore, [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[iterative]] verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix ''-ta'', and the [[derived stems]] are therefore called Gt, Dt, \u0160t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix ''-tan-'', giving the Gtn, Dtn, \u0160tn and Ntn. Because of the [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of ''n'', the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt [[Dynamic verb|durative]].\n\nThe final stem is the \u0160D-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the \u0160-stem or the D-stem of the same verb.  It is formed with the \u0160 prefix (like the \u0160-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).\n\nAn alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using [[Roman numeral]]s so that G, D, \u0160 and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the [[infix]]es are numbered using [[Arabic numeral]]s; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the \u0160tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.\n\nThere is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and \u0160-stems.\n\nThe stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular [[Akkadian language#Stative|stative]] of the verb ''par\u0101sum'' (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n! # || Stem || Verb || Description || Correspondence\n|-\n|I.1||G||''PaRiS''||the simple stem, used for [[Transitive verbs|transitive]] and [[intransitive verbs]]|| Arabic stem I (''fa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew pa'al\n|-\n|II.1||D||''PuRRuS''||gemination of the second radical, indicating the intensive|| Arabic stem II (''fa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''pi\u2018el''\n|-\n|III.1||\u0160||''\u0161uPRuS''||\u0161-preformative, indicating the causative|| Arabic stem IV (''\u2019af\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hiph\u2018il''\n|-\n|IV.1||N||''naPRuS''||n-preformative, indicating the reflexive/passive|| Arabic stem VII (''infa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''niph\u2018al''\n|-\n|I.2||Gt||''PitRuS''||simple stem with t-infix after first radical, indicating reciprocal or reflexive|| Arabic stem VIII (''ifta\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ithpe\u2018al'' (tG)\n|-\n|II.2||Dt||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by infixed t, indicating intensive reflexive|| Arabic stem V (''tafa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hithpa\u2018el'' (tD)\n|-\n|III.2||\u0160t||''\u0161utaPRuS''||\u0161-preformative with t-infix, indicating reflexive causative|| Arabic stem X (''istaf\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ittaph\u2018al'' (tC)\n|-\n|IV.2||Nt||''itaPRuS'' || n-preformative with a t-infix preceding the first radical, indicating reflexive passive || rowspan='6' bgcolor='gray' |\n|-\n|I.3||Gtn||''PitaRRuS''||simple stem with tan-infix after first radical|\n|-\n|II.3||Dtn||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by tan-infix\n|-\n|III.3||\u0160tn|| ''\u0161utaPRuS'' ||\u0161-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|IV.3||Ntn||''itaPRuS''||n-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|||\u0160D||''\u0161uPuRRuS''||\u0161-preformative with doubled second radical\n|}\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n===Stative===\nA very often appearing form which can be formed by [[noun]]s, [[adjectives]] as well as by [[predicative verb|verbal adjectives]] is the [[stative]]. [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Nominal predicatives]] occur in the [[status absolutus]] and correspond to the verb \"to be\" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ''\u0161arrum'' (king), the adjective ''rap\u0161um'' (wide) and the verbal adjective ''parsum'' (decided).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!''\u0161arrum''\n!''rap\u0161um''\n!''parsum''\n|-\n| '''1st Person singular''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ku'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ku'' || ''pars-\u0101ku''\n|-\n| '''1st Person plural''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101nu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101nu'' || ''pars-\u0101nu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ta'' || ''pars-\u0101ta''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ti'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ti'' || ''pars-\u0101ti''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tunu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tunu'' || ''pars-\u0101tunu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tina'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tina'' || ''pars-\u0101tina''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161ar-\u00d8'' || ''rapa\u0161-\u00d8'' || ''paris-\u00d8''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-at'' || ''rap\u0161-at'' || ''pars-at''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u016b'' || ''rap\u0161-\u016b'' || ''pars-\u016b''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101'' || ''pars-\u0101''\n|-\n|}\n\nThus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' is equivalent to: \"you were king\", \"you are king\" and \"you will be king\". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.\n\n===Derivation===\nBeside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb [[triliteral|roots]]. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is [[labial consonant|labial]] (p, b, m), the [[prefix]] becomes na- (maPRaS > naPRaS).  Examples for this are: ''ma\u0161kanum'' (place, location) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''ma\u0161ra\u1e2bum'' (splendour) from \u0160R\u1e2a (be splendid), ''ma\u1e63\u1e63arum'' (guards) from N\u1e62R (guard), ''nap\u1e2barum'' (sum) from  P\u1e2aR (summarize).\n\nA very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example ''ma\u0161kattum'' (deposit) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''narkabtum'' (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).\n\nThe [[suffix]] - \u016bt is used to derive [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract nouns]]. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. ''ab\u016btum'' (paternity) from ''abum'' (father), ''rabutum'' (size) from ''rabum'' (large), ''wa\u1e63\u016btum'' (leaving) from W\u1e62Y (leave).\n\nAlso derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of \"make X do something\" or \"becoming X\", for example: ''du\u0161\u0161\u00fbm'' (let sprout) from ''di\u0161u'' (grass), ''\u0161ullu\u0161um'' (to do something for the third time ) from ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' (three).\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\n\n=====Independent personal pronouns=====\nIndependent [[personal pronouns]] in Akkadian are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Nominative || colspan=2 | Oblique || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|Singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| an\u0101ku \"I\" || n\u012bnu \"we\" || y\u0101ti || ni\u0101ti || y\u0101\u0161im || ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  atta \"you\" ||  attunu \"you\" || k\u0101ti (k\u0101ta) || kun\u016bti ||k\u0101\u0161im || kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| atti \"you\" || attina \"you\" || k\u0101ti || kin\u0101ti || k\u0101\u0161im || kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| \u0161\u016b \"he\" || \u0161unu \"they\" || \u0161\u0101tilu (\u0161\u0101tilu) || \u0161un\u016bti ||\u0161u\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| \u0161\u012b \"she\" || \u0161ina \"they\" || \u0161i\u0101ti (\u0161u\u0101ti;\u0161\u0101ti) || \u0161in\u0101ti || \u0161i\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im, \u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====\n[[Suffix]]ed (or [[enclitic]]) pronouns (mainly denoting the [[genitive]], [[accusative]] and [[dative]]) are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Genitive || colspan=2 | Accusative || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| -i, -ya <ref group=t5>-ni is used for the nominative, i.e. following a verb denoting the subject.</ref> || -ni || -ni || -ni\u0101ti || -am/-nim || -ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  -ka ||  -kunu || -ka || -kun\u016bti || -kum || -kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -ki || -kina || -ki || -kin\u0101ti || -kim || -kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161unu || -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161un\u016bti || -\u0161um || -\u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -\u0161a || -\u0161ina || -\u0161i || -\u0161in\u0101ti || -\u0161im || -\u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n====Demonstrative pronouns====\n[[Demonstrative pronoun]]s in Akkadian differ from the [[West Semitic languages|Western Semitic]] variety.

However, only the form ''\u0161a'' (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.\n\n====Interrogative pronouns====\nThe following table shows the [[Interrogative pronouns]] used in Akkadian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Akkadian\n! English\n|-\n| ''mannu''||who?\n|-\n| ''m\u012bn\u016b''||what?\n|-\n| ''ayyu''||which?\n|-\n|}\n\n===Prepositions===\nAkkadian has [[preposition]]s which consist mainly of only one word. For example: ''ina'' (in, on, out, through, under), ''ana'' (to, for, after, approximately), ''adi'' (to), ''a\u0161\u0161u'' (because of), ''eli'' (up, over), ''i\u0161tu/ultu'' (of, since), ''mala'' (in accordance with), ''itti'' (also, with). There are, however, some compound prepositions which are combined with ''ina'' and ''ana'' (e.g. ''ina ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards), ''ina balu'' (without), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r'' (up to), ''ana ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the [[genitive]] [[case ending|case]].\n\nExamples: ''ina b\u012btim'' (in the house, from the house), ''ana dummuqim'' (to do good), ''itti \u0161arrim'' (with the king), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r m\u0101r\u012b\u0161u'' (up to his son).\n\n===Numerals===\nSince [[Numeral system|numeral]]s are written mostly as a number sign in the [[cuneiform]] script, the [[transliteration]] of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the [[cardinal number|cardinal numeral]]s are in the [[status absolutus]]. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the [[status rectus]] are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21\u201329, 31\u201339, 41\u201349 correspond with the counted in the [[grammatical gender]], while the numerals 3\u201320, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by [[polarity of gender]], i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa. This polarity is typical of the [[Semitic language]]s and appears also in [[Arabic language|classical Arabic]] for example. The numerals 60, 100 and 1000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. However, body parts which occur in pairs appear in the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form  in Akkadian. e.g. ''\u0161epum'' (foot) becomes ''\u0161ep\u0101n'' (two feet).\n\nThe [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s are formed (with a few exceptions) by adding a [[case ending]] to the nominal form PaRuS (the P, R and S. must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral). It is noted, however, that in the case of the numeral \"one\", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] occurs in the numeral \"four\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Akkadian numbers<ref>Huehnergard, 3rd ed., \u00a723.2</ref>\n!rowspan=3|#\n!colspan=4|Cardinal \n!Congruence \n!colspan=2|Ordinal\n|-\n!colspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(Gender agreement of the cardinal numeral)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n|-\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n|-\n| align='left' | 1 || ''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113num'') || ''i\u0161teat'', ''i\u0161t\u0113t'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113tum'') || Congruent (no gender polarity) || ''p\u0101n\u00fbm''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u00fbm''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012b\u02beum'')<br>''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || ''p\u0101n\u012btum''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u012btum''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012btum'')<br>''i\u0161teat''\n|-\n| align='left' | 2 || ''\u0161in\u0101'' || \u2014 || ''\u0161itt\u0101'' || \u2014 || Congruent || ''\u0161an\u00fbm'' || ''\u0161an\u012btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 3 || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161at'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u0161al\u0161um'' || ''\u0161alu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 4 || ''erbet(ti)'' || ''erbettum'' || ''erbe'', ''erba'' || ''erb\u00fbm'' || Gender polarity || ''reb\u00fbm'' || ''reb\u016btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 5 || ''\u1e2bam\u0161at'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161tum'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161'' || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || ''\u1e2bamu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 6 || ''\u0161e\u0161\u0161et'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161''?

(Modern [[South Semitic]] languages in [[Ethiopia]] also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO) language [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].) It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the [[Sumerian language]], which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a [[sprachbund]] could have formed.{{sfn | Deutscher | 2000 | p=21}} Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb.  Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin. Although classified as '[[East Semitic]]', many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages. For example: ''m\u0101ru'' 'son' (Semitic *bn), ''q\u0101tu'' 'hand' (Semitic *yd), ''\u0161\u0113pu'' 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), ''qab\u00fb'' 'say' (Semitic *qwl), ''izuzzu'' 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), ''ana'' 'to, for' (Semitic *li).\n\nDue to extensive contact with Sumerian and [[Aramaic]], the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words, however, were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of [[Mesopotamia]], whereas Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from [[Hurrian]], [[Kassite language|Kassite]], [[Ugaritic]] and other ancient languages.\nSince Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. However, some verbs were borrowed (along with many nouns) from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.\n\nThe following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Akkadian\n!Meaning\n!Source\n!Word in the language of origin\n|-\n| ''d\u00fb'' || hill || Sumerian || ''du''\n|-\n| ''er\u0113qu'' || flee || Aramaic || ''\u02bfRQ'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''gadal\u00fb'' || dressed in linen || Sumerian || ''gada l\u00e1''\n|-\n| ''isinnu'' || firmly || Sumerian || ''ezen''\n|-\n| ''kasulat\u1e2bu'' || a device of copper || Hurrian || ''kasulat\u1e2b-''\n|-\n| ''kisallu'' || court || Sumerian || ''kisal''\n|-\n| ''laq\u0101\u1e2bu'' || take || Ugaritic || ''LQ\u1e24''([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''para\u0161\u0161annu'' || part of horse riding gear || Hurrian || ''para\u0161\u0161ann-''\n|-\n| ''purkullu'' || stone cutter || Sumerian || ''bur-gul''\n|-\n| ''qa\u1e6d\u0101lu'' || kill || Aramaic || ''Q\u1e6cL'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''uri\u1e2bullu'' || conventional penalty || Hurrian || ''uri\u1e2bull-''\n|-\n|}\nAkkadian was also a source of borrowing to other languages, above all [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. Some examples are: Sumerian ''da-ri'' ('lastingly', from Akkadian ''d\u0101ru''), Sumerian ''ra gaba'' ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian ''r\u0101kibu'').\n\n==Sample text==\nThe following is the 7th section of the [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi law code]], written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| \u0161umma aw\u012bl-um l\u016b kasp-am l\u016b \u1e2bur\u0101\u1e63-am l\u016b ward-am l\u016b amt-am\n| if man-NOM or silver-ACC or gold-ACC or slave-M.ACC or slave-F.ACC\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| l\u016b alp-am l\u016b immer-am l\u016b im\u0113r-am \u016b l\u016b {mimma \u0161um\u0161u} ina\n| or cattle/oxen-ACC or sheep-ACC or donkey-ACC and or something from\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| q\u0101t m\u0101r aw\u012bl-im \u016b l\u016b warad aw\u012bl-im balum \u0161\u012bb-\u012b u\n| hand-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} son-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN and or slave-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN without witnesses-GEN and\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| riks-\u0101tim i-\u0161t\u0101m-\u00d8 \u016b l\u016b ana ma\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r\u016bt-im i-m\u1e2bur-\u00d8\n| contracts-GEN bought-3.SG.PERF and or for safekeeping-GEN received-3.SG.PRET\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q i-dd\u0101k\n| man-NOM he-3.M.SG stealer-{{gcl|ABS|Status Absolutus|Absolute state}} is_killed-3.SG.PASS-PRS\n|}}\n\nTranslation:\n:''If a man has bought silver or gold, a male or a female slave,<br/>an ox, a sheep, or a donkey\u2014or anything for that matter\u2014<br/>from another man or from another man\u2019s slave without witnesses or contract,<br/>or if he accepted something for safekeeping without same,<br/>then this man is a thief and hence to be killed.''\n\n==Akkadian literature==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n{{Main|Akkadian literature}}\n*[[Atrahasis Epic]] (early 2nd millennium BC)\n*[[En\u00fbma Elish]] (c. 18th century BC)\n*[[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC)\n*[[Epic of Gilgamesh]] ([[Sin-liqe-unninni]]', Standard Babylonian version, 13th to 11th century BC)\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi|Ludlul Bel Nemeqi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Aro, Jussi (1957).

In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, correspondence, political and military events, and many other examples. \n\nAkkadian (in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ([[Akkadian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]]) throughout the later Bronze Age, and Akkadian became the [[lingua franca]] of much of the Ancient [[Near East]] by the time of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. Its decline began in the Iron Age,   during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], by about the 8th century BC ([[Tiglath-Pileser III]]), \nin favour of [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]].  By the [[Hellenistic period]], the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia.

Akkadian and its successor Aramaic, however, are only ever attested in Mesopotamia and the Near East.\n\nWithin the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] subgroup (with [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]]). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] or [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order. This novel word order is due to the influence of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] substratum, which has an SOV order.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAdditionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]]s ''ina'' and ''ana'' ([[locative case]], English ''in''/''on''/''with'', and [[dative case|dative]]-locative case, ''for''/''to'', respectively). Other Semitic languages like [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] have the prepositions ''bi/b\u0259'' and ''li/l\u0259'' (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.\n\nIn contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant [[fricative consonant|fricative]]: '''\u1e2b''' {{IPA|[x]}}. Akkadian lost both the [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian [[sibilant]]s were exclusively [[affricate consonant|affricated]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and writing==\n\n===Writing===\n{{Main|Akkadian cuneiform}}\n[[Image:AkkadischLand.png|200px|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform writing]] (Neoassyrian script)<br />(1 = Logogram (LG) \"mix\"/syllabogram (SG) ''{{IPA|\u1e2bi}}'',<br />2 = LG \"moat\",<br />3 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u02be}}'',<br />4 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|e\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|i\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|u\u1e2b}}'',<br />5 = SG ''kam'',<br />6 = SG ''im'',<br />7 = SG ''bir'')]]\nOld Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c. 2500 BC. It was written using [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[logogram]]s (''i.e.'', picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) [[phonetic complement]]s. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged [[Syllabary|syllabic script]], and the original [[Logogram|logographic]] nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign ''AN'' can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ''ilum'' ('god') and on the other signify the god [[Anu]] or even the syllable ''-an-''. Additionally, this sign was used as a [[determinative]] for divine names.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ''{{transl|sem|A\u1e2a}}'', do not distinguish between the different [[vowel]] qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ''{{transl|sem|-\u0161a-}}'', for example, is rendered by the sign ''{{transl|sem|\u0160A}}'', but also by the sign ''{{transl|sem|N\u012a\u011c}}''. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.\n\nCuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important [[phonemes]] in Semitic, including a [[glottal stop]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and [[emphatic consonant]]s. In addition, cuneiform was a [[syllabary]] writing system\u2014i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit\u2014frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).\n\n===Development===\nAkkadian is divided into several [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] based on [[geography]] and [[historical period]]:<ref>Caplice, p.5 (1980)</ref>\n*Old Akkadian, 2500\u20131950 BC\n*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950\u20131530 BC\n*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530\u20131000 BC\n*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000\u2013600 BC\n*Late Babylonian, 600 BC\u2013100 AD\n[[File:Antiochus cylinder.jpg|thumb|left|Cylinder of Hellenistic king [[Antiochus I]] (r.281\u2013261 BC), as great king of kings of [[Babylon]], restorer of gods [[Esagila|E-sagila]] and [[E-zida]].

During the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.\n\nOld Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect [[Mari, Syria|Mariotic]], is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related [[Eblaite language]]. For this reason, forms like ''lu-prus'' ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older ''la-prus''. While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the \"Assyrian [[vowel harmony]]\". Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and a [[relative pronoun]] declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Akkadian have been recovered from the [[K\u00fcltepe]] site in [[Anatolia]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.<ref>K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}</ref>\n\nOld Babylonian was the language of king [[Hammurabi]] and his [[Code of Hammurabi|code]], which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].) The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire [[Ancient Near East]], including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from [[Northwest Semitic languages]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.\n\nMiddle Assyrian served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in much of the [[Ancient Near East]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] ([[Amarna Period]]). During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by [[Old Aramaic]]. Under the [[Achaemenids]], Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the [[Hellenistic period]] when it was further marginalized by [[Koine Greek]], even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunger |first1=Hermann |last2=de Jong |first2=Teije |title=Almanac W22340a From Uruk: The Latest Datable Cuneiform Tablet |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie |date=30 January 2014 |volume=104 |issue=2 |doi=10.1515/za-2014-0015}}</ref> However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=C.

From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.\n\nDuring the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a ''lingua franca''. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and [[Aramaic]] were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of [[Neo-Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]]. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction in 612 BC. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a ''lingua franca''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejongjul.org/archive/view_article?pid=jul-5-1-1|title=Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538-333 B.C.E.)|last=Bae|first=Chul-hyun|date=2004|website=Journal of Universal Language|doi=10.22425/jul.2004.5.1.1|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian.\n\nAfter the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which were conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.

The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from [[Edward Hincks]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Jules Oppert]] in the middle of the 19th century.

For the sibilants, traditionally /\u0161/ has been held to be postalveolar {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and /s/, /z/, /{{transl|sem|\u1e63}}/ analyzed as fricatives; but attested [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] in Akkadian suggest otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\". In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68.</ref> For example, when the possessive suffix ''-\u0161u'' is added to the root ''awat'' ('word'), it is written ''awassu'' ('his word') even though ''\u0161\u0161'' would be expected. The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from ''t\u0161'' to ''ss'' is that /s, \u1e63/ form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s t\u0361s\u02bc]}}, *\u0161 is a voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|[s]}}, and *z is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative {{IPA|[d\u0361z~z]}}. The assimilation is then [awat+su] > {{IPA|[awatt\u0361su]}}. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *\u0161 is *s\u0320, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible, however. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} could have been assimilated to the preceding {{IPA|[t]}}, yielding {{IPA|[ts]}}, which would later have been simplified to {{IPA|[ss]}}.\n\nThe phoneme /r/ has traditionally been interpreted as a trill but its pattern of alternation with /{{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e2b}}/ suggests it was a velar (or uvular) fricative. In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian /r/ was transcribed using the Greek \u03c1, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]] (though Greeks may also have perceived a [[uvular trill]] as \u03c1).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Descent from Proto-Semitic ===\nSeveral [[Proto-Semitic]] phonemes are lost in Akkadian.

(section on vowels and semi-vowels)</ref> There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Akkadian and Eblaite|url = https://www.academia.edu/6933497|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19|last = Huehnergard & Woods|page = 233}}</ref>\n\nAll consonants and [[vowel]]s appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are represented in writing as double consonants, and long vowels are written with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u016b). This distinction is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and is used in the grammar, for example ''iprusu'' ('that he decided') versus ''iprus\u016b'' ('they decided').\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns of Akkadian are disputed, with some authors claiming that nothing is known of the topic. There are however certain points of reference, such as the rule of vowel syncope, and some forms in the cuneiform that might represent the stressing of certain vowels; however, attempts at identifying a rule for stress have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nHuenergard (2005:3-4) claims that stress in Akkadian is completely predictable. In his syllable typology there are three syllable weights: ''light'' (V, CV); ''heavy'' (CVC, CV\u0304, CV\u0302), and ''superheavy'' (CV\u0302C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed.\n\nA rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is ''PaRiS-''. Thus the masculine singular nominative is ''PaRS-um'' (< ''*PaRiS-um'') but the feminine singular nominative is ''PaRiStum'' (< ''*PaRiS-at-um''). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Consonantal root====\nMost roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants (called the radicals), but some roots are composed of four consonants (so-called quadriradicals). The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example ''PRS'' (to decide). Between and around these radicals various [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[prefix]]es, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. Also, the middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription (and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself).\n\nThe consonants ''{{IPA|\u0294}}'', ''{{IPA|w}}'', ''{{IPA|j}}'' and ''{{IPA|n}}'' are termed \"weak radicals\" and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.\n\n==== Case, number and gender ====\nFormally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]]). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.), and adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single [[oblique case]].\n\nAkkadian, unlike [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but like [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], has only \"sound\" plurals formed by means of a plural ending (i.e. no [[broken plurals]] formed by changing the word stem). As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (''-\u0101t'').\n\nThe nouns ''\u0161arrum'' (king) and ''\u0161arratum'' (queen) and the adjective ''dannum'' (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Noun and adjective paradigms\n !\n !

Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in ''-um'' in the singular and the resulting forms serve as [[adverbial]]s. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the ''um''-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition ''ina''.\n\nIn the later stages of Akkadian the [[mimation]] (word-final ''-m'') - along with [[nunation]] (dual final \"-n\") - that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to ''-u'' and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings (although often sporadically and incorrectly). As the most important [[Language contact|contact language]] throughout this period was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomenon.\n\n====Noun states and nominal sentences====\nAs is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of \"states\" depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the ''status rectus'' (the [[governed state]]), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the ''status absolutus'' (the [[absolute state]]) and the ''status constructus'' ([[Construct state]]). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.\n\nThe status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. ''aw\u012bl'' < ''aw\u012blum'', ''\u0161ar'' < ''\u0161arrum''). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.\n\n(1) ''Aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161\u016b'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr\u0101q.''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | he <small>(3rd masc. personal pronoun)</small> || Align=\"right\" | thief (status absolutus)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' This man is a thief\n\n(2) ''\u0161arrum l\u0101 \u0161an\u0101n''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''l\u0101'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161an\u0101n.''\n|-\n| King <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | not <small>(negative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | oppose <small>(verbal infinitive, status absolutus)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king who cannot be rivaled\n\nThe status constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the ''shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible''. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:\n\n(3) ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n|-\n| Son (status constructus) + his <small>(3rd person singular possessive pronoun) </small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' His son, its (masculine) son\n\nbut\n\n(4) ''m\u0101r \u0161arr-im''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101r'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-im''\n|-\n| Son (Status constructus) || king (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king's son\n\nThere are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like ''kalbum'' (dog) and ''ma\u1e2brum'' (front) would have illegal construct state forms ''*kalb'' and ''*ma\u1e2br'' unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. ''kalab'', ''ma\u1e2bar''). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ''\u0161aknum'' < ''*\u0161akinum'' \"governor\"). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so ''\u0161aknum'' yields ''\u0161akin'').\n\n(5) ''kalab belim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''kalab'' || Align=\"center\" | ''bel-im''\n|-\n| dog (Status constructus) || master (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The master's dog\n\n(6) ''\u0161akin \u0101lim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161akin'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0101l-im''\n|-\n| Governor (Status constructus) || city (genitive singular)\n|}\n\nA genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ''\u0161a'', and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.\n\n(7) sal\u012bm\u0101tum \u0161a aw\u012bl E\u0161nunna\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''sal\u012bm\u0101tum'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''aw\u012bl''|| Align=\"center\" | ''E\u0161nunna''\n|-\n| Alliances <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | which <small>(relative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | man <small>(status constructus)</small> || Align=\"right\" | E\u0161nunna <small>(genitive, unmarked)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The alliances of the Ruler of E\u0161nunna (literally \"Alliances which man of E\u0161nunna (has)\")\n\nThe same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.\n\n(7) ''aw\u012bl-um \u0161a m\u0101t-am i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101t-am'' || Align=\"center\" | ''i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | that <small>(relative pronoun)</small> || Align=\"center\" | land (singular, accusative) || Align=\"center\" | 3rd person - conquer (preterite) - singular, masculine - subjunctive\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The man who conquered the land\n\n====Verbal morphology====\n\n=====Verb aspects=====\nThe Akkadian verb has six [[Finite verb|finite]] [[Grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] ([[preterite]],  [[Perfective|perfect]], [[present tense|present]], [[imperative (grammar)|imperative]], [[Irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] and [[vetitive]]) and three [[Non-finite verb|infinite]] forms ([[infinitive]], [[participle]] and [[Non-finite verb|verbal adjective]]). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Imperative mood#Indicative and prohibitive mood|prohibitive]], formed by the present form of the verb and the negative [[adverb]] l\u0101, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a [[verbal noun]], and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in [[grammatical case|case]]. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the [[semantics]] of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the [[English gerund]].\n\nThe following table shows the conjugation of the [[Derived stem|G-stem]] verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!\n!

The subjunctive is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix -u (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives), but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost\n#[[Ventive|Venitive]] or [[allative]]. The venitive is not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the 1st person dative pronominal suffix -am/-m/-nim. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion towards an object or person (e.g. ''illik'', \"he went\" vs. ''illikam'', \"he came\"). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\",\"to separate\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Preterite.<ref group=t4 name=third-pm>Both verbs are for the 3rd person masculine singular.</ref>\n! [[Akkadian language#Stative|Stative]].<ref group=t4 name=third-pm/>\n|-\n!

[[Ventive|Venitive]]\n| ''iprusam'' || ''parsam''\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t4}}\n\n=====Verb patterns=====\nAkkadian verbs have thirteen separate [[derived stem]]s formed on each [[Triliteral|root]]. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning \"basic stem\"). [[Causative]] or [[intensive]] forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The \u0160-stem is formed by adding a prefix ''\u0161-'', and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a ''n-'' prefix. However the ''n-'' element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.\n\nFurthermore, [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[iterative]] verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix ''-ta'', and the [[derived stems]] are therefore called Gt, Dt, \u0160t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix ''-tan-'', giving the Gtn, Dtn, \u0160tn and Ntn. Because of the [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of ''n'', the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt [[Dynamic verb|durative]].\n\nThe final stem is the \u0160D-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the \u0160-stem or the D-stem of the same verb.  It is formed with the \u0160 prefix (like the \u0160-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).\n\nAn alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using [[Roman numeral]]s so that G, D, \u0160 and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the [[infix]]es are numbered using [[Arabic numeral]]s; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the \u0160tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.\n\nThere is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and \u0160-stems.\n\nThe stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular [[Akkadian language#Stative|stative]] of the verb ''par\u0101sum'' (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n! # || Stem || Verb || Description || Correspondence\n|-\n|I.1||G||''PaRiS''||the simple stem, used for [[Transitive verbs|transitive]] and [[intransitive verbs]]|| Arabic stem I (''fa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew pa'al\n|-\n|II.1||D||''PuRRuS''||gemination of the second radical, indicating the intensive|| Arabic stem II (''fa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''pi\u2018el''\n|-\n|III.1||\u0160||''\u0161uPRuS''||\u0161-preformative, indicating the causative|| Arabic stem IV (''\u2019af\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hiph\u2018il''\n|-\n|IV.1||N||''naPRuS''||n-preformative, indicating the reflexive/passive|| Arabic stem VII (''infa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''niph\u2018al''\n|-\n|I.2||Gt||''PitRuS''||simple stem with t-infix after first radical, indicating reciprocal or reflexive|| Arabic stem VIII (''ifta\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ithpe\u2018al'' (tG)\n|-\n|II.2||Dt||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by infixed t, indicating intensive reflexive|| Arabic stem V (''tafa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hithpa\u2018el'' (tD)\n|-\n|III.2||\u0160t||''\u0161utaPRuS''||\u0161-preformative with t-infix, indicating reflexive causative|| Arabic stem X (''istaf\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ittaph\u2018al'' (tC)\n|-\n|IV.2||Nt||''itaPRuS'' || n-preformative with a t-infix preceding the first radical, indicating reflexive passive || rowspan='6' bgcolor='gray' |\n|-\n|I.3||Gtn||''PitaRRuS''||simple stem with tan-infix after first radical|\n|-\n|II.3||Dtn||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by tan-infix\n|-\n|III.3||\u0160tn|| ''\u0161utaPRuS'' ||\u0161-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|IV.3||Ntn||''itaPRuS''||n-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|||\u0160D||''\u0161uPuRRuS''||\u0161-preformative with doubled second radical\n|}\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n===Stative===\nA very often appearing form which can be formed by [[noun]]s, [[adjectives]] as well as by [[predicative verb|verbal adjectives]] is the [[stative]]. [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Nominal predicatives]] occur in the [[status absolutus]] and correspond to the verb \"to be\" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ''\u0161arrum'' (king), the adjective ''rap\u0161um'' (wide) and the verbal adjective ''parsum'' (decided).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!''\u0161arrum''\n!''rap\u0161um''\n!''parsum''\n|-\n| '''1st Person singular''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ku'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ku'' || ''pars-\u0101ku''\n|-\n| '''1st Person plural''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101nu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101nu'' || ''pars-\u0101nu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ta'' || ''pars-\u0101ta''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ti'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ti'' || ''pars-\u0101ti''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tunu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tunu'' || ''pars-\u0101tunu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tina'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tina'' || ''pars-\u0101tina''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161ar-\u00d8'' || ''rapa\u0161-\u00d8'' || ''paris-\u00d8''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-at'' || ''rap\u0161-at'' || ''pars-at''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u016b'' || ''rap\u0161-\u016b'' || ''pars-\u016b''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101'' || ''pars-\u0101''\n|-\n|}\n\nThus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' is equivalent to: \"you were king\", \"you are king\" and \"you will be king\". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.\n\n===Derivation===\nBeside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb [[triliteral|roots]]. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is [[labial consonant|labial]] (p, b, m), the [[prefix]] becomes na- (maPRaS > naPRaS).  Examples for this are: ''ma\u0161kanum'' (place, location) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''ma\u0161ra\u1e2bum'' (splendour) from \u0160R\u1e2a (be splendid), ''ma\u1e63\u1e63arum'' (guards) from N\u1e62R (guard), ''nap\u1e2barum'' (sum) from  P\u1e2aR (summarize).\n\nA very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example ''ma\u0161kattum'' (deposit) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''narkabtum'' (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).\n\nThe [[suffix]] - \u016bt is used to derive [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract nouns]]. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. ''ab\u016btum'' (paternity) from ''abum'' (father), ''rabutum'' (size) from ''rabum'' (large), ''wa\u1e63\u016btum'' (leaving) from W\u1e62Y (leave).\n\nAlso derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of \"make X do something\" or \"becoming X\", for example: ''du\u0161\u0161\u00fbm'' (let sprout) from ''di\u0161u'' (grass), ''\u0161ullu\u0161um'' (to do something for the third time ) from ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' (three).\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\n\n=====Independent personal pronouns=====\nIndependent [[personal pronouns]] in Akkadian are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Nominative || colspan=2 | Oblique || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|Singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| an\u0101ku \"I\" || n\u012bnu \"we\" || y\u0101ti || ni\u0101ti || y\u0101\u0161im || ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  atta \"you\" ||  attunu \"you\" || k\u0101ti (k\u0101ta) || kun\u016bti ||k\u0101\u0161im || kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| atti \"you\" || attina \"you\" || k\u0101ti || kin\u0101ti || k\u0101\u0161im || kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| \u0161\u016b \"he\" || \u0161unu \"they\" || \u0161\u0101tilu (\u0161\u0101tilu) || \u0161un\u016bti ||\u0161u\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| \u0161\u012b \"she\" || \u0161ina \"they\" || \u0161i\u0101ti (\u0161u\u0101ti;\u0161\u0101ti) || \u0161in\u0101ti || \u0161i\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im, \u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====\n[[Suffix]]ed (or [[enclitic]]) pronouns (mainly denoting the [[genitive]], [[accusative]] and [[dative]]) are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Genitive || colspan=2 | Accusative || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| -i, -ya <ref group=t5>-ni is used for the nominative, i.e. following a verb denoting the subject.</ref> || -ni || -ni || -ni\u0101ti || -am/-nim || -ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  -ka ||  -kunu || -ka || -kun\u016bti || -kum || -kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -ki || -kina || -ki || -kin\u0101ti || -kim || -kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161unu || -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161un\u016bti || -\u0161um || -\u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -\u0161a || -\u0161ina || -\u0161i || -\u0161in\u0101ti || -\u0161im || -\u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n====Demonstrative pronouns====\n[[Demonstrative pronoun]]s in Akkadian differ from the [[West Semitic languages|Western Semitic]] variety.

However, only the form ''\u0161a'' (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.\n\n====Interrogative pronouns====\nThe following table shows the [[Interrogative pronouns]] used in Akkadian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Akkadian\n! English\n|-\n| ''mannu''||who?\n|-\n| ''m\u012bn\u016b''||what?\n|-\n| ''ayyu''||which?\n|-\n|}\n\n===Prepositions===\nAkkadian has [[preposition]]s which consist mainly of only one word. For example: ''ina'' (in, on, out, through, under), ''ana'' (to, for, after, approximately), ''adi'' (to), ''a\u0161\u0161u'' (because of), ''eli'' (up, over), ''i\u0161tu/ultu'' (of, since), ''mala'' (in accordance with), ''itti'' (also, with). There are, however, some compound prepositions which are combined with ''ina'' and ''ana'' (e.g. ''ina ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards), ''ina balu'' (without), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r'' (up to), ''ana ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the [[genitive]] [[case ending|case]].\n\nExamples: ''ina b\u012btim'' (in the house, from the house), ''ana dummuqim'' (to do good), ''itti \u0161arrim'' (with the king), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r m\u0101r\u012b\u0161u'' (up to his son).\n\n===Numerals===\nSince [[Numeral system|numeral]]s are written mostly as a number sign in the [[cuneiform]] script, the [[transliteration]] of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the [[cardinal number|cardinal numeral]]s are in the [[status absolutus]]. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the [[status rectus]] are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21\u201329, 31\u201339, 41\u201349 correspond with the counted in the [[grammatical gender]], while the numerals 3\u201320, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by [[polarity of gender]], i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa. This polarity is typical of the [[Semitic language]]s and appears also in [[Arabic language|classical Arabic]] for example. The numerals 60, 100 and 1000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. However, body parts which occur in pairs appear in the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form  in Akkadian. e.g. ''\u0161epum'' (foot) becomes ''\u0161ep\u0101n'' (two feet).\n\nThe [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s are formed (with a few exceptions) by adding a [[case ending]] to the nominal form PaRuS (the P, R and S. must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral). It is noted, however, that in the case of the numeral \"one\", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] occurs in the numeral \"four\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Akkadian numbers<ref>Huehnergard, 3rd ed., \u00a723.2</ref>\n!rowspan=3|#\n!colspan=4|Cardinal \n!Congruence \n!colspan=2|Ordinal\n|-\n!colspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(Gender agreement of the cardinal numeral)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n|-\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n|-\n| align='left' | 1 || ''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113num'') || ''i\u0161teat'', ''i\u0161t\u0113t'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113tum'') || Congruent (no gender polarity) || ''p\u0101n\u00fbm''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u00fbm''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012b\u02beum'')<br>''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || ''p\u0101n\u012btum''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u012btum''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012btum'')<br>''i\u0161teat''\n|-\n| align='left' | 2 || ''\u0161in\u0101'' || \u2014 || ''\u0161itt\u0101'' || \u2014 || Congruent || ''\u0161an\u00fbm'' || ''\u0161an\u012btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 3 || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161at'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u0161al\u0161um'' || ''\u0161alu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 4 || ''erbet(ti)'' || ''erbettum'' || ''erbe'', ''erba'' || ''erb\u00fbm'' || Gender polarity || ''reb\u00fbm'' || ''reb\u016btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 5 || ''\u1e2bam\u0161at'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161tum'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161'' || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || ''\u1e2bamu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 6 || ''\u0161e\u0161\u0161et'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161''?

(Modern [[South Semitic]] languages in [[Ethiopia]] also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO) language [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].) It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the [[Sumerian language]], which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a [[sprachbund]] could have formed.{{sfn | Deutscher | 2000 | p=21}} Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb.  Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin. Although classified as '[[East Semitic]]', many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages. For example: ''m\u0101ru'' 'son' (Semitic *bn), ''q\u0101tu'' 'hand' (Semitic *yd), ''\u0161\u0113pu'' 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), ''qab\u00fb'' 'say' (Semitic *qwl), ''izuzzu'' 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), ''ana'' 'to, for' (Semitic *li).\n\nDue to extensive contact with Sumerian and [[Aramaic]], the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words, however, were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of [[Mesopotamia]], whereas Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from [[Hurrian]], [[Kassite language|Kassite]], [[Ugaritic]] and other ancient languages.\nSince Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. However, some verbs were borrowed (along with many nouns) from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.\n\nThe following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Akkadian\n!Meaning\n!Source\n!Word in the language of origin\n|-\n| ''d\u00fb'' || hill || Sumerian || ''du''\n|-\n| ''er\u0113qu'' || flee || Aramaic || ''\u02bfRQ'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''gadal\u00fb'' || dressed in linen || Sumerian || ''gada l\u00e1''\n|-\n| ''isinnu'' || firmly || Sumerian || ''ezen''\n|-\n| ''kasulat\u1e2bu'' || a device of copper || Hurrian || ''kasulat\u1e2b-''\n|-\n| ''kisallu'' || court || Sumerian || ''kisal''\n|-\n| ''laq\u0101\u1e2bu'' || take || Ugaritic || ''LQ\u1e24''([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''para\u0161\u0161annu'' || part of horse riding gear || Hurrian || ''para\u0161\u0161ann-''\n|-\n| ''purkullu'' || stone cutter || Sumerian || ''bur-gul''\n|-\n| ''qa\u1e6d\u0101lu'' || kill || Aramaic || ''Q\u1e6cL'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''uri\u1e2bullu'' || conventional penalty || Hurrian || ''uri\u1e2bull-''\n|-\n|}\nAkkadian was also a source of borrowing to other languages, above all [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. Some examples are: Sumerian ''da-ri'' ('lastingly', from Akkadian ''d\u0101ru''), Sumerian ''ra gaba'' ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian ''r\u0101kibu'').\n\n==Sample text==\nThe following is the 7th section of the [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi law code]], written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| \u0161umma aw\u012bl-um l\u016b kasp-am l\u016b \u1e2bur\u0101\u1e63-am l\u016b ward-am l\u016b amt-am\n| if man-NOM or silver-ACC or gold-ACC or slave-M.ACC or slave-F.ACC\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| l\u016b alp-am l\u016b immer-am l\u016b im\u0113r-am \u016b l\u016b {mimma \u0161um\u0161u} ina\n| or cattle/oxen-ACC or sheep-ACC or donkey-ACC and or something from\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| q\u0101t m\u0101r aw\u012bl-im \u016b l\u016b warad aw\u012bl-im balum \u0161\u012bb-\u012b u\n| hand-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} son-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN and or slave-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN without witnesses-GEN and\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| riks-\u0101tim i-\u0161t\u0101m-\u00d8 \u016b l\u016b ana ma\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r\u016bt-im i-m\u1e2bur-\u00d8\n| contracts-GEN bought-3.SG.PERF and or for safekeeping-GEN received-3.SG.PRET\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q i-dd\u0101k\n| man-NOM he-3.M.SG stealer-{{gcl|ABS|Status Absolutus|Absolute state}} is_killed-3.SG.PASS-PRS\n|}}\n\nTranslation:\n:''If a man has bought silver or gold, a male or a female slave,<br/>an ox, a sheep, or a donkey\u2014or anything for that matter\u2014<br/>from another man or from another man\u2019s slave without witnesses or contract,<br/>or if he accepted something for safekeeping without same,<br/>then this man is a thief and hence to be killed.''\n\n==Akkadian literature==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n{{Main|Akkadian literature}}\n*[[Atrahasis Epic]] (early 2nd millennium BC)\n*[[En\u00fbma Elish]] (c. 18th century BC)\n*[[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC)\n*[[Epic of Gilgamesh]] ([[Sin-liqe-unninni]]', Standard Babylonian version, 13th to 11th century BC)\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi|Ludlul Bel Nemeqi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Aro, Jussi (1957).
