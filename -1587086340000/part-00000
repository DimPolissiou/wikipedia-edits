The Fleet Air Arm wings badges also feature a crown and fouled anchor, reflecting the naval aspect of the flying undertaken. They are worn on the left sleeve of naval aviators, above the rank \"rings\" as opposed to on the left breast of uniforms, like the RAF and Army Air Corps. Unlike the RAF and the Army Air Corps, Naval aircrew are awarded their wings after Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), whereupon they are posted to a frontline squadron, the majority of their flying training complete. Therefore, while a Navy and RAF aircrew might take a similar amount of time to reach an operational squadron, the Naval officer has to wait until he has completed his conversion training to receive his wings. \n\nRoyal Naval Observers are awarded their own aircrew brevet, consisting of shorter wings either side of a fouled anchor surmounted by a Crown, upon completion of their OCU, like Royal Navy pilots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/june/12/170612-aviators-get-their-wings|title=Aviators get their Flying Wings {{!}} Royal Navy|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nRoyal Naval Aircrewmen are awarded a brevet similar in shape to the Observer wings, with slightly narrower wings and a similar anchor, but with no crown. \n\nAll Royal Navy aircrew wear their wings on the left sleeve of the Number 1 dress uniform jacket, above any rank insignia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/-/media/royal-navy-responsive/documents/reference-library/br-3-vol-1/chapter-39.pdf|title=Royal Navy BR3 - Dress Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===British Army===\n[[File:Army_Air_Corps_brevet.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Army Air Corps Pilot Flying Badge]]\nThe [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] pilot wings are awarded upon completion of the basic helicopter course at [[RAF Shawbury]] and a subsequent Army course at [[AAC Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop Airfield]]. Aircrew are then dispatched to their OCU to receive type training on either the [[AgustaWestland Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter or the [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat]] battlefield support helicopter. A small number of Army aircrew are streamed fixed wing to fly the Army's [[Britten-Norman Defender|Islander/Defender]] reconnaissance aircraft, or to become instructors at the Defence Elementary Flying School on the [[Grob G 115|Tutor]] training aircraft.\n\nThe Army is unique in the British military in that both [[Officer (armed forces)#United Kingdom|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer#United Kingdom|Non-Commissioned Officers]] can become aircrew and aircraft commanders. The wings are identical for both Officers and Other Ranks, and are worn on the left chest above any medals, similar to the RAF.\n\nIn all the services, award of wings does not confer any operational capability \u2013 this is declared by a front-line squadron once the student has reached satisfactory standard to allow them to be deployed operationally. This milestone, or 'Combat Ready Status', is the threshold necessary for the award of Flying Pay, a discretionary additional salary bonus for aircrew due to the nature of their work.\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Brevet1.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Australian Air Force loadmaster flying badge]]\n\n[[Royal Australian Air Force]] flying badges differ from those in the RAF mainly in having a crown on all Flying Badges (not just on pilot's wings) and in normally having blue wreaths.
