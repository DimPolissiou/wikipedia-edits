From that time onwards, all the property around Hampton Court also became the property of the Monarch and this included The Old Court House. It is the only house on Hampton Court Green, other than [[Hampton Court]] itself, to have a garden that stretches to the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=TelegApr13/>\n\nWren's dining room is now used as a study. This beautifully proportioned room features wood panelling chosen by Wren and a fine marble fireplace similar to the one he installed for [[William III of England|King William III]] in the King's dining room in Hampton Court Palace. Beyond the reception hall, a flight of stone steps take you into the garden which leads right down to the Thames. In Wren's day his most important visitors \u2013 normally royalty \u2013 would arrive by river, walk across the garden and up those steps to enter his house via the back door. This meant the garden had to be just as magnificent as the house. The building is accordingly surrounded by several different types of tree and copious bushes bursting with figs, walnuts, apples, [[crab apples]], cherries, raspberries, mint and [[borage]]. The greenery extends all the way to the river bank while York stone terraces lead to a pea shingle path which is flanked by lawn. This path then leads to a pond and fountain that was built by Wren and which was listed before The Old Court House itself. Wren's tool house is now a charming garden room from which to enjoy the garden in the summer.\n\n==History==\n\nKing Henry VIII took the newly built Hampton Court Palace from Cardinal Wolsey in 1526. All the property around Hampton Court then belonged to the Monarch. (See ''Hampton Court: The Story of a Village'' by Gerald Heath.)\n\nIn 1669, Wren (1632-1723) was appointed as the Royal Surveyor by King Charles II. Previously, Inigo Jones and Sir John Denham held this post. The King had been impressed by Wren's plans to reconstruct the City of London after the Great Fire of 1666. The Royal Surveyor, or Surveyor General, was like a modern Minister of Works. He ordered the King's works at all of the palaces; Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James Palace and Windsor Castle. Wren held this post for 49 years until 1718, straddling 5 reigns: Charles II, James II, William III and Mary II, and Anne and George I, while at the same time building many city churches, including St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nAt each Royal palace, the Surveyor General had lodgings. These at Hampton Court became the Old Court House Built in 1536. Wren's biggest task at Hampton Court was the construction of the Eastern part of Hampton Court Palace (the square part) including the main East and South fronts, and Fountain Court. William and Mary had wanted to rebuild Hampton Court Palace entirely, but with the early death of Mary in 1694, King William lost heart. The project was only half done. Hampton Court was left as it remains today, half Tudor and half Wren.\n\nWren, already aged 76, was granted in 1708, a 50-year lease of The Old Court House by Queen Anne. This was partly in lieu of arrears of salary for building St Pauls Cathedral. He had been paid on a time basis. The authorities thought that, to be paid more, he had dragged his feet. See Parentalia p 343:\n\n''\u201cIn an act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of King William for the completing and adorning of the cathedral church of St Paul, London, a clause was inserted to suspend a moiety (i.e. half) of the surveyor\u2019s salary until the said church should be finished; thereby the better to encourage to him to finish the same with the utmost diligence and expedition.''\n\n''\u201cIt was at this time a common notion and misreport that the surveyor received a large annual salary for that building and consequently it was in his interest to prolong the finishing of the fabrick for the continuance of this supposed emolument. Which it would seem occasioned that clause...''\n\n''\u201cUpon the compleating of this great fabric (St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in 1708) a clause passed in the act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne declaring the church finished, to empower the commissioners to pay the surveyor the arrears of this moiety of his salary.\u201d''\n\n''NB: The bottom of page 344 says: \u201cHe then betook himself to country retirement.\u201d''\n\nThe word \"retirement\" here has its ancient meaning. It means withdraw or drawing back (not ceasing to be employed or moving house). Wren had already lived in the Old Court House since 1669, and since 1708 as long leaseholder.\n\nThe Treasury minutes, page 26 1708 say:\n\n''\u201cHer Majesty (Queen Anne) observes that when Sir Christopher dies his house will go to his executors and consequently the surveyor of the works who will have no house at the Hampton Court. Nevertheless in regard Sir Christopher has been an old servant to the Crown, the Queen will gratify him in his request.\u201d''\n\nStephen Wren in 1749 sold the rest of his grandfather's 50-year Crown lease.\n\n===Wren and subsequent owners and occupiers===\n\nIn 1669 Wren was appointed as the Royal Surveyor by King Charles II. He ordered the King's works at all of the palaces; Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James Palace and Windsor Castle. Wren held this post for 49 years until 1718, straddling five reigns; Charles II, James II, William III and Mary II, Anne and George I whilst at the same time building many city churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. At each palace the Royal Surveyor had lodgings. At Hampton Court these were The Old Court House.\n\nTowards the end of World War I until 1921 The Old Court House was the temporary site of the Hampton Court Auxiliary Hospital which had been started by the British Red Cross and the Order of St. John to nurse wounded soldiers (see \"The Story of Molesey Hospital\" by Rowland G. M. Baker, published 1981).\n\nSubsequent lessees included Admiral Sir Alexander Montgomery, the Dowager Lady Clinton and General [[Henry Wheatley|Sir Henry Wheatley]].\n\nNorman Lamplugh, a distinguished collector, lived at the house from 1908 to 1938 (see 1 October 1938 issue of ''Country Life''). He was followed by the 2nd Earl of Ypres who was a [[watercolour]] painter. He was the son of 1st World War Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] who became the 1st Earl of Ypres.\n\nIn 1958, the form of tenure changed. In part exchange for an increase in the Queen's civil list, many Crown freeholds were passed from the property section of Buckingham Palace to Crown Estates. A 99-year Crown Estate lease began with Ronald Lee (at The Old Court House 1958-64). He was a well-known dealer in antiques, especially in clocks, in Bruton Street, London W1. His lease included permission to trade in antiques from The Old Court House. He hived off and sold the lease of the neighbouring Paper House which had been joined to the Old Court House since 1810. (Prior to 1810, The Old Court House had been called Paper House.)\n\nIn 1964, Ronald Lee sold the house to Stewart De Quincey Walker \u2013 the partner-in-crime of the notorious Dr [[Emil Savundra]]. Both were jailed for fraud in 1968.\n\nEarlier in 1966, the house was sold, reputedly for a suitcase full of banknotes, to Julian Reynolds. He sold the remaining 89-year lease in 1968 to [[Toby Jessel]], then one of the two [[Greater London Council]] members for the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, in which Hampton Court Palace and The Old Court House are both situated.\n\nToby Jessel was elected MP for Twickenham in 1970 and served for 27 years until 1997. In 1980, he married the actress and singer Eira Heath and he owned The Old Court House for over 45 years.\n\nIn 1984 The Crown Estates department sold the freeholds to many leaseholders of houses around Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James and Windsor including The Old Court House, the freehold to which was acquired by Jessel. During his ownership of The Old Court House, Jessel entertained many people from the political establishment at The Old Court House, including [[Margaret Thatcher]] when she was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].\n\n==The Old Court House \u2013 the building==\n\n''Tudor times''\n\nThe original Tudor building of Old Court House was built for the Surveyor general in 1536 (see Gerald Heath book). The Knight Frank and Rutley brochure of 1966 p4 mentions a carved stone surround of Tudor design behind the existing Charles II fireplace in the study (formerly the dining room), but we have not exposed this.\n\nSome of the brick wall in the garden is probably Tudor, being \"English bond\" (pre 1689 when William of Orange who became William III introduced \"Flemish Bond\"). The cobbled part of Faraday yard behind has similar cobbles to Tudor cobbles both in the palace and in the Royal mews in Hampton Court road. There is a (possibly) Tudor beam in the cellar, previously the kitchen.\n\n===Early changes to The Old Court House===\n\n1660-68 \u2013 Gerald Heath's paper pages (G) 1, 2, 3 shows works to the surveyors \"lodgings\" when the Royal Surveyor was Sir John Denham.\n\n1669 \u2013 Wren became the Surveyor General, from 1670 repairs were made to the surveyors \"house\" (pages 3,4,5)\n\n1706 \u2013 Wren referred to the \"great decay\" of the house, 1708 prior to Wren's 50-year lease Savil Travers(?) reported it as \"old and decayed and will be expensive to repair\".\n\n1708 \u2013 Wren's lease of 50 years started (see pages 3, 4)\n\n1709-10 \u2013 Wren undertook extensive renovations of The Old Court House in 1706. Wren altered the house a great deal- he built a virtually new house.\n\nIn 1708 Queen Anne granted him a 50-year lease on the property in lieu of overdue payments for his work on [[St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n1723 \u2013 Death of Wren.\n\n1730s or 1740s \u2013 The back (south) half of the house was added in the time of Christopher Wren junior. This includes the drawing room on the first floor, and 3 of the 5 bedrooms on the second floor, and the new dining room (previously the library) the back hall, and the kitchen on the ground floor.\n\nIn 1749 his grandson Stephen Wren sold the remainder of the lease.\n\n===Later changes to The Old Court House===\n\n1810-? \u2013 The master gardener's house (now called Paper House) was joined to the Old Court House to make one house. They were finally separated in 1960 after Ronald Lee had, in 1958, bought a 99-year crown lease of the whole.\n\nThe effects of the 1810 to 1960 join include (i) a joint roof over the front; and (ii) the Old Court House cellar (the original kitchen) goes a little under Paper House. Neither has led to any problems between the two households.\n\n1823 or later \u2013 The Greek motifs were put into the drawing room and what is now the master bedroom on the 1st floor probably by General Sir Henry Wheatley (era of Byron, and schools then taught Greek).\n\nAfter 1858 the 2 drawing rooms were made into one. Lady Clinton put bow windows onto the front of the house.\n\nLamplugh (1908\u201338) installed works of art as set out in the Country Life article of 1 October 1938. He altered the back hall to put in two 16th century Venetian paintings into the ceiling and put up the carved door into the current dining room.\n\nDe Quincey Walker (1964\u201366) put polished oak stripped floors were put into the hall and study on the ground floor and into the drawing room and landing on the first floor; a pillared and marble double bathroom on the first floor adjoining the master bedroom.\n\nIn 1968-69 Toby Jessel:\n# Put new bathroom (the 4th bath in house) beside the Red room on top floor \u2013 space was taken from the Chinese room.\n# Constructed a steel beam over the dining room ceiling to support a heavy chandelier (Drawings available).\n# Turned the library into the dining room and turned the dining room into a study.\n# Closed the 2nd doorway from the main bedroom to the first floor landing to create a 2nd bedroom cupboard.\n# Closed the 2nd doorway from the front hall to the study to create an alcove for books (this had been accessed from the kitchen to what had previously been the dining room).\n# Removed dilapidated glass conservatory from balcony outside first floor drawing room. Put in new balustrades.\n\n===Changes to the outbuildings and garden 1930s \u2013 ===\n\nFront garden: Lamplugh put in a wrought iron gate, previously a wooden gate (see old photos) which is still in situ today.  Back garden: the early map marked \"P\" shows two gardens separated by a wall. The long thin one with parallel sides with access from the Thames, and the semi-trapezium shape to the West, presumably the kitchen garden. It is not known when the wall between was knocked down.  Between the 1st and 2nd World Wars, what is now the Mitre Hotel's river garden was hived off from the Old Court House to the Mitre. The curved path leading round into it can be traced.  Lamplugh had a small museum between the Green and the Mitre Hotel \u2013 traces of a doorway in the wall are still visible by Wren's pond.\n\nIn 1996 [[English Heritage]] marked Wren at the Old Court House with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name='EngHer'>{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/wren-sir-christopher-1632-1723|title=WREN, SIR CHRISTOPHER (1632\u20131723)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{LB Richmond}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Old Court House, The}}\n[[Category:1536 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Christopher Wren buildings in London]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed houses]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in the 18th century]]\n[[Category:Houses in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2017}}\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name =The Old Court House\n| native_name =\n| native_language =\n| image =Christopher Wren - The Old Court House Hampton Court Green East Molesey KT8 9BS.jpg\n| caption =\n| locmapin =Greater London\n| coordinates = {{coord|51|24|18.4|N|0|20|32.5|W|display=inline,title}}\n| location =Hampton Court Green, [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], England\n| area =\n| built =early 18th century<ref name='EngHet'/>\n| architect = \n| architecture = [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]]\n| governing_body = Privately owned\n| designation1 =Grade II* listed building\n| designation1_offname =The Old Court House<ref name='EngHet'/>\n| designation1_date =25 June 1983<ref name='EngHet'>{{NHLE|desc=The Old Court House|num=1080796|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n| designation1_number =1080796\n| designation2 =\n| designation2_offname =\n| designation2_date =\n| designation2_number =\n}}\n\n'''The Old Court House''' is a [[Listed building|Grade II* listed]]<ref name='EngHet'/> house located off Hampton Court Green in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]; its origins date back to 1536.

She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\".

He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage.

She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\".

He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage.

{"title_page": "Exploitation of labour", "text_new": "{{short description|Economic phenomenon}}\n'''Exploitation of labour''' is the act of using [[power]] to systematically extract more value from workers than is given to them. It is a [[social relationship]] based on an asymmetry of power between workers and their employers. When speaking about exploitation, there is a direct affiliation with consumption in [[social theory]] and traditionally this would label exploitation as unfairly taking advantage of another person because of their inferior position, giving the exploiter the power.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dowding, Keith (2011). \"Exploitation\". ''Encyclopedia of Power''. SAGE Publications. pp. 232\u2013235. {{ISBN|9781412927482}}.</ref>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] is considered the most classical and influential theorist of exploitation. Marx recognized exploitation of labour as morally unjust, but put more emphasis on economic injustice, highlighting the mathematical inequity of pay to value produced. In analyzing exploitation, economists are split on the explanation of the exploitation of labour given by Marx and [[Adam Smith]]. Smith did not see exploitation as an inherent systematic phenomena in certain economic systems as Marx did, but rather as an optional moral injustice.<ref>Horace L. Fairlamb, 'Adam's Smith's Other Hand: A Capitalist Theory of Exploitation', ''Social Theory and Practice'', 1996.</ref>\n\n== Marxist theory ==\n{{Marxian economics}}\nMarx's exploitation theory is one of the major elements analyzed in [[Marxian economics]] and some social theorists consider it to be a cornerstone in Marxist thought. Marx credited the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] writers for originally propounding a [[Materialism|materialist]] interpretation of history.<ref>Andrew Reeve, ''Modern Theories of Exploitation''\"</ref> In his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', Marx set principles that were to govern the distribution of welfare under [[socialism]] and [[communism]]\u2014these principles saw distribution to each person according to their work and needs. Exploitation is when these two principles are not met, when the agents are not receiving according to their work or needs.<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\">Jon Elster, \"Exploring Exploitation\", ''The Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17</ref> This process of exploitation is a part of the redistribution of labour, occurring during the process of separate agents exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\">John E. Roemer, 'Should Marxists be Interested in Exploitation', ''Philosophy & Public Affairs'', Vol. 14, No. 1, 1985, pg 30-65</ref> The labour put forth toward production is embodied in the goods and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth.<ref>John E. Roemer, \"Origins of Exploitation and Class: Value Theory of Pre-Capitalist Economy\", ''Econometrica'', Vol. 50, No. 1, 1982, pp. 163-192</ref> This labour performed by a population over a certain time period is equal to the labour embodied to the goods that make up the [[net national product]] (NNP). The NNP is then parceled out to the members of the population in some way and this is what creates the two groups, or agents, involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/>\n\nThe exploiters are the agents able to command goods, with revenue from their wages, that are embodied with more labour than the exploiters themselves have put forth- based on the exploitative [[Relations of production|social relations]] of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist production]]. These agents often have class status and ownership of productive assets that aid the optimization of exploitation. The exploiters would typically be the [[bourgeoisie]]. Meanwhile, the exploited are those who receive less than the average product he or she produces. If workers receive an amount equivalent to their average product, there is no revenue left over and therefore these workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours and the difference between what is made and what that can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to need.<ref>Jon Elster, \"Exploring Exploitation\", The Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17</ref> The exploited are the [[proletariat]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Surplus labour and labour theory of value ===\nExploiters appropriate another's [[surplus labour]], which is the amount of labour exceeding what is necessary for the reproduction of a worker's [[labour power]] and basic living conditions. In other terms, this entails the worker being able to maintain living conditions sufficient to be able to continue work. Marx does not attempt to tie this solely to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] institutions as he notes how historically, there are accounts of this appropriation of surplus labour in institutions with forced labour, like those based on [[slavery]] and [[Feudalism|feudal]] societies. However, the difference he emphasizes is the fact that when this appropriation of surplus labour occurs in societies like capitalist ones, it is occurring in institutions having abolished forced labour and resting on free labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This comes from Marx's [[labour theory of value]] which states that the [[Exchange value|exchange-value]] of a [[commodity]] is proportional to the [[Socially necessary labour time|socially necessary amount of labour time]] to produce the commodity.\n\nIn a capitalist economy, workers are paid according to this value and value is the source of all wealth. Value is determined by a good's particular utility for an actor and if the good results from human activity, it must be understood as a product of concrete labour, qualitatively defined labour. Capitalists are able to purchase labour power from the workers, who can only bring their own labour power in the market. Once capitalists are able to pay the worker less than the value produced by their labour, surplus labour forms and this results in the capitalists' profits. This is what Marx meant by \"[[surplus value]]\", which he saw as \"an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital, or of the laborer by the capitalist\".<ref>Marx, Karl. [1867] 1967. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, vol. 1. New York: International Publishers.</ref> This profit is used to pay for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] and personal consumption by the capitalist, but was most importantly used to accelerate growth and thus promote a greater system of exploitation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe degree of exploitation of labour power is dictated by the rate of surplus value as the proportion between surplus value/[[Surplus product|product]] and necessary value/product. The surplus value/product is the materialized surplus labour or surplus labour time while the necessary value/product is materialized necessary labour in regard to workers, like the reproduction of the labour power.<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\" /> Marx called the rate of surplus value an \"exact expression of the degree of exploitation of labour power by capital\".<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital'', Vol. 1, as translated in J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 233, {{ISBN|978-90-04-32331-5}}, which also explains the significance of the difference between this translation of Marx's phrase, and the translation reproduced earlier in this Wikipedia entry, which, Furner argues, is wrong. </ref> These theories ultimately demonstrate Marx's main issue with capitalism: it was not that capitalism was not an institution where the labour exchange is coercive, but that in this institution one class still becomes significantly more rich while the other becomes impoverished.\n\n=== Critique and rejection ===\nMany capitalist critics have pointed out that Marx assumes that capital owners contribute nothing to the process of production. They suggest that Marx should have allowed for two things; namely, permit a fair profit on the risk of capital investment and allow for the efforts of management be paid their due.\n\n[[David Ramsay Steele]] argues that [[Marginal productivity|marginal productivity theory]] renders Marx's theory of exploitation untenable. According to this theoretical framework and assuming competitive market conditions, a worker's compensation is determined by his or her contribution to marginal output. Similarly, owners of machines and real estate are compensated according to the marginal productivity of their capital's contribution to marginal output. However, Steele notes that this does not in any way touch the ethical argument of socialists who acknowledge non-labour contributions to marginal output, but contend that it is illegitimate for a class of passive owners to receive an [[unearned income]] from ownership of capital and land.<ref>{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 143|quote= One of the fateful consequences of marginal productivity is that it sweeps away such theories as Marx\u2019s which see interest as \u2018unpaid labour\u2019. Under competitive market conditions, a worker tends to be paid what his labour contributes to output, no more and no less. The same goes for an owner of a machine or piece of real estate. The analysis demonstrates the symmetry of all types of inputs: there is as much sense as saying that labour exploits capital, or that electricity exploits roofing tiles. Of course, this does not touch the ethical arguments of socialists who acknowledge that non-labour factors make a determinate contribution to output, analytically separable from labour\u2019s contribution, yet still contend that it is illegitimate for anyone to own capital or land and reap the payment for their services. But that is not the position of Marx, nor many other socialists. }}</ref>\n\n[[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai]] observed that there is also the prospect of surplus value arising from sources other than labour and a classic given example is winemaking. When grapes are harvested and crushed, labour is used. However, when yeast is added and the grape juice is left to ferment in order to get wine, the value of wine exceeds that of the grapes significantly, yet labour contributes nothing to the extra value. Marx had ignored capital inputs due to placing them all together in constant capital\u2014translating the wear and tear of capital in production in terms of its labour value. Yet examples such as this demonstrated that value and surplus value could come from somewhere other than labour.<ref>Desai, Meghnad, ''Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism'', 2002, Verso Books, page 264</ref> \n\nThe theory has been opposed by [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]], among others. In ''History and Critique of Interest Theories'' (1884), he argues that capitalists do not exploit their workers, as they actually help employees by providing them with an income well in advance of the revenue from the goods they produced, stating: \"Labor cannot increase its share at the expense of capital\". In particular, he argues that the theory of exploitation ignores the dimension of time in production. From this criticism, it follows that, according to B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, the whole value of a product is not produced by the worker, but that labour can only be paid at the present value of any foreseeable output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/story/1680 |title=B\u00f6hm-Bawerk\u2019s Critique of the Exploitation Theory of Interest &#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref>\n\n[[John Roemer]] studied and criticized Marx's theory by putting forth a model to deal with exploitation in all modes of production, hoping to lay the foundations for an analysis of the laws of motion of socialism. In his works published in the 1980s, Roemer posits a model of exploitation based upon unequal ownership of human (physical labour skills) and non-human property (land and means of production). He states that this model of property rights has great superiority over the conventional surplus labour model of exploitation, therefore rejecting the labour theory of value.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/> In his attempt to put forward a theory of exploitation that also includes feudal, capitalist and socialist modes of production, he defines exploitation in each of the modes in terms of property rights. Roemer rejects the labour theory of value because he sees that exploitation can exist in the absence of employment relations, like in a subsistence economy, therefore backing the model of exploitation that is based on property rights. He tests his theory of exploitation using game theory to construct contingently feasible alternative states where the exploited agents could improve their welfare by withdrawing with their share of society's alienable and inalienable assets.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/> Feudal, capitalist and socialist exploitation all come from the theory of exploitation on the basis of inequitable distribution of property rights. There has been a range of agreement and disagreement from various economists, neo-classical economists favoring the model the most.\n\nSome theorists criticize Roemer for his entire rejection of the labour theory of value and the surplus labour approach to exploitation, for they were the central aspects of Marxist thought in regard to exploitation.<ref>Khalid Nadvi, 'Exploitation and Labour Theory Of Value: A Critique of Roemer's Theory of Exploitation and Class', ''Economic and Political Weekly'', Vol. 20, No. 25, 1985, 1479-1494</ref> Others criticize his commitment to a specifically liberal as opposed to a Marxist account of the wrongs of exploitation.<ref>For example, [[Allen W. Wood]], ''Karl Marx'' (Routledge 2004) and [[Nicolas Vrousalis]], 'Exploitation, Vulnerability and Social Domination', ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', Vol. 41, 2013, 131-157</ref>\n\n== Other theories ==\n=== Liberal theory ===\n{{liberalism sidebar}}\nMany assume that [[liberalism]] intrinsically lacks any adequate theory of exploitation because its phenomenon commits itself only to the primacy of personal rights and liberties and to individual choice as the basic explanatory datum. [[Hillel Steiner]] provided an argument to refute the claim that liberalism cannot supply an adequate theory of exploitation.<ref>Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', ''Ethics'', Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 225-241</ref> He discusses interpersonal transfers and how there are three types: donation, exchange and theft. Exchange is the only of the three that consists of a voluntary bilateral transfer, where the beneficiary receives something at a value greater than zero on the shared scale of value, although at times there can be ambiguity between more complex types of transfer. He describes the three dimensions of transfers as either unilateral/bilateral, voluntary/involuntary and equal/unequal. Despite these types of transfers being able to distinguish the differences in the four types of transfers, it is not enough to provide a differentiating characterization of exploitation. Unlike theft, an exploitative transfer is bilateral and the items are transferred voluntarily at both unequal and greater-than-zero value. The difference between a benefit and exploitation despite their various shared features is a difference between their counterfactual presuppositions, meaning that in an exploitation there is a voluntary bilateral transfer of unequally valued items because the possessors of both items would voluntarily make the transfer if the items to be transferred were of equal value, but in a benefit the possessor of the higher-value item would not voluntarily make the transfer if the items were at equal value. Put simply, the exploitation can be converted to an exchange: both exploiters and exploited would voluntarily become exchangers when benefactors would not.\n\nIn an exploitation both transfers are voluntary, but part of one of the two transfers is unnecessary. The circumstances that bring out exploitation are not the same as what brings about exploitative transfers. Exploitative circumstance is due to the factors other than what motivates individuals to engage in nonaltruistic bilateral transfers (exchanges and exploitations) as they are not sufficient circumstances to bring about exploitative transfers.\n\nTo further explain the occurrence of exploitative circumstances certain generalizations about social relations must be included to supply generalizations about social institutions. He says that 'if (i) certain things are true of the institutions within which interpersonal transfers occur and (ii) at least some of these transfers are nonaltruistic bilateral ones, then at least some of these transfers are exploitative.<ref>Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', ''Ethics'', Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 229</ref> Steiner looks at the institutional conditions of exploitation and finds that in general exploitation is considered unjust and to understand why it is necessary to look at the concept of a right, an inviolable domain of practical choice and the way rights are established to form social institutions. Institutional exploitation can be illustrated by schematized forms of exploitation to reach two points:\n:#Despite the mode of deprivation in exploitation, it is not the same as the mode involved in a violation of rights and it does result from such violations and the two deprivations may be of the same value.\n:#Rights violation (theft) is a bilateral relation, but exploitation is trilateral one. There are at least three persons needed for exploitation.\n\nOn a liberal view, exploitation can be described as a quadrilateral relation between four relevantly distinct parties: the state, the exploited, the exploiter and those who suffer rights violations. However, it can be argued that the state's interests with the exploiters action can be viewed as unimpeachable because you cannot imply that the exploiter would ever withhold consent from exploiting due to altruistic concerns. So this trilateral conception of exploitation identifies exploited, exploiters and sufferers of rights violations.\n\nIn terms of ridding exploitation, the standard liberal view holds that a regime of ''laissez-faire'' is a necessary condition. Natural rights thinkers [[Henry George]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] reject this view and claim that property rights belong to everyone, i.e. that all land to be valid must belong to everyone. Their argument aims to show that traditional liberalism is mistaken in holding that nonintervention in commerce is the key to non exploitation and they argue it is necessary, but not sufficient.\n\n=== Neoclassical notions ===\nThe majority of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] only would view exploitation existing as an abstract deduction of the classic school and of [[David Ricardo#Ricardo's theories of wages and profits|Ricardo's theory of surplus-value]].<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\"/> However, in some neoclassical economic theories exploitation is defined by the unequal marginal productivity of workers and wages, such that wages are lower. Exploitation is sometimes viewed to occur when a necessary agent of production receives less wages than its marginal product.<ref>J. Schumpter, ''The theory of economic development'', Harvard University Press, 1949</ref> Neoclassical theorists also identify the need for some type of [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution of income]] to the poor, disabled, to the farmers and peasants, or whatever socially alienated group from the [[social welfare function]]. However, it is not true that neoclassical economists would accept the marginal productivity theory of just income as a general principle like other theorists do when addressing exploitation. The general neoclassical view sees that all factors can be simultaneously rewarded according to their marginal productivity: this means that factors of production should be awarded according to their marginal productivity as well, Euler's [[Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions|theorem for homogeneous function]] of the first order proves this:\n:''f''(K,L)= ''f''<sub>K</sub>(K,L)K+''f''<sub>L</sub>(K,L)L\nThe production function where K is capital and L is labour. Neoclassical theory requires that ''f'' be continuously differentiable in both variables and that there are constant returns to scale. If there are constant returns to scale, there will be perfect equilibrium if both capital and labour are rewarded according to their marginal products, exactly exhausting the total product.\n\nThe primary concept is that there is exploitation towards a factor of production, if it receives less than its marginal product. Exploitation can only occur in imperfect capitalism due to imperfect competition, with the neoclassical notion of productivity wages there is little to no exploitation in the economy.<ref>Milan Zafirovski, 'Measuring and Making Sense of Labor Exploitation in Contemporary Society: A Comparative Analysis', ''Review of Radical Political Economies'', 2003, Vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 462-484</ref> This blames [[monopoly]] in the product market, [[monopsony]] in the labour market and [[cartel]]lization as the main causes for exploitation of workers.\n\n== In developing nations ==\n[[Developing country|Developing nations]], commonly called [[Third World]] countries, are the focus of much debate over the issue of exploitation, particularly in the context of the global economy.\n\nCritics of foreign companies allege that firms such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap Inc.]] resort to [[child labour]] and [[sweatshop]]s in [[developing nations]], paying their workers wages far lower than those that prevail in [[developed nations]] (where the products are sold). It is argued that this is insufficient to allow workers to attain the local subsistence standard of living if working hours common in the [[First World]] are observed, so that working hours much longer than in the first world are necessary. It is also argued that work conditions in these developing world factories are more unsafe and much more unhealthy than in the First World. For example, observers point to cases where employees were unable to escape factories burning down\u2014and thus dying\u2014because of locked doors, a common signal that sweatshop conditions exist, similar to the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] of 1911.\n\nOthers argue that in the absence of compulsion the only way that corporations are able to secure adequate supplies of labour is to offer wages and benefits superior to preexisting options and that the presence of workers in corporate factories indicates that the factories present options which are seen as better\u2014by the workers themselves\u2014than the other options available to them (see [[principle of revealed preference]]).\n\nA common response is that this is disingenuous as the companies are in fact exploiting people by the terms of unequal human standards (applying lower standards to their Third World workers than to their First World ones). Furthermore, the argument goes that if people choose to work for low wages and in unsafe conditions because it is their only alternative to starvation or scavenging from garbage dumps (the \"preexisting options\"), this cannot be seen as any kind of \"free choice\" on their part. It also argued that if a company intends to sell its products in the First World, it should pay its workers by First World standards.\n\nFollowing such a view, some in the [[United States]] propose that the American government should mandate that businesses in foreign countries adhere to the same labour, environmental, health and safety standards as the United States before they are allowed to trade with businesses in the United States (this has been advocated by [[Howard Dean]], for example). They believe that such standards would improve the [[quality of life]] in less developed nations.\n\nAccording to others, this would harm the economies of less developed nations by discouraging the United States from investing in them. [[Milton Friedman]] was an economist who thought that such a policy would have that effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawkins |first=John |url=http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/friedman.php |title=An Interview With Milton Friedman &#124; John Hawkins' Right Wing News |publisher=Rightwingnews.com |date=2015-03-25 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref> According to this argument, the result of ending perceived exploitation would therefore be the corporation pulling back to its developed nation, leaving their former workers out of a job.\n\nGroups who see themselves as fighting against global exploitation also point to secondary effects such as the dumping of government-subsidized corn on developing world markets which forces subsistence farmers off of their lands, sending them into the cities or across borders in order to survive. More generally, some sort of international regulation of [[multinational corporations|transnational corporations]] is called for, such as the enforcement of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s labour standards.\n\nThe [[fair trade]] movement seeks to ensure a more equitable treatment of producers and workers, therefore minimizing exploitation of labour forces in developing countries. The exploitation of labour is not limited to the aforementioned large scale corporate outsourcing, but it can also be found within the inherent structure of local markets in developing countries like Kenya.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martinus van Tilborgh |url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/mission/how-do-we-find-our-artists |title=How do we find our artists |publisher=Villagemarkets.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref>\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{main|Labour economics}}\n{{see also|Wage slavery}}\n{{labour}}\nWage labour as institutionalized under today's market economic systems has been criticized,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> especially by both mainstream [[Socialism|socialists]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]],<ref name=\"English Working Class p. 599\">{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.</ref><ref name=\"English Working Class p. 912\">{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.</ref><ref name=\"Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133\">{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.</ref><ref name=\"Shop Floor p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.</ref> utilising the pejorative term [[wage slavery]].<ref name=\"merriam-webster.com\">{{cite web |title= Wage Slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> They regard the trade of labour as a commodity as a form of economic exploitation rooting partially from [[capitalism]].\n\nAs per [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era.

Marx recognized exploitation of labour as morally unjust, but put more emphasis on economic injustice, highlighting the mathematical inequity of pay to value produced. In analyzing exploitation, economists are split on the explanation of the exploitation of labour given by Marx and [[Adam Smith]]. Smith did not see exploitation as an inherent systematic phenomena in certain economic systems as Marx did, but rather as an optional moral injustice.<ref>Horace L. Fairlamb, 'Adam's Smith's Other Hand: A Capitalist Theory of Exploitation', ''Social Theory and Practice'', 1996.</ref>\n\n== Marxist theory ==\n{{Marxian economics}}\nMarx's exploitation theory is one of the major elements analyzed in [[Marxian economics]] and some social theorists consider it to be a cornerstone in Marxist thought. Marx credited the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] writers for originally propounding a [[Materialism|materialist]] interpretation of history.<ref>Andrew Reeve, ''Modern Theories of Exploitation''\"</ref> In his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', Marx set principles that were to govern the distribution of welfare under [[socialism]] and [[communism]]\u2014these principles saw distribution to each person according to their work and needs. Exploitation is when these two principles are not met, when the agents are not receiving according to their work or needs.<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\">Jon Elster, \"Exploring Exploitation\", ''The Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17</ref> This process of exploitation is a part of the redistribution of labour, occurring during the process of separate agents exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\">John E. Roemer, 'Should Marxists be Interested in Exploitation', ''Philosophy & Public Affairs'', Vol. 14, No. 1, 1985, pg 30-65</ref> The labour put forth toward production is embodied in the goods and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth.<ref>John E.

Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/>\n\nThe exploiters are the agents able to command goods, with revenue from their wages, that are embodied with more labour than the exploiters themselves have put forth- based on the exploitative [[Relations of production|social relations]] of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist production]]. These agents often have class status and ownership of productive assets that aid the optimization of exploitation. The exploiters would typically be the [[bourgeoisie]]. Meanwhile, the exploited are those who receive less than the average product he or she produces. If workers receive an amount equivalent to their average product, there is no revenue left over and therefore these workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours and the difference between what is made and what that can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to need.<ref>Jon Elster, \"Exploring Exploitation\", The Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 3-17</ref> The exploited are the [[proletariat]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Surplus labour and labour theory of value ===\nExploiters appropriate another's [[surplus labour]], which is the amount of labour exceeding what is necessary for the reproduction of a worker's [[labour power]] and basic living conditions. In other terms, this entails the worker being able to maintain living conditions sufficient to be able to continue work. Marx does not attempt to tie this solely to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] institutions as he notes how historically, there are accounts of this appropriation of surplus labour in institutions with forced labour, like those based on [[slavery]] and [[Feudalism|feudal]] societies. However, the difference he emphasizes is the fact that when this appropriation of surplus labour occurs in societies like capitalist ones, it is occurring in institutions having abolished forced labour and resting on free labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This comes from Marx's [[labour theory of value]] which states that the [[Exchange value|exchange-value]] of a [[commodity]] is proportional to the [[Socially necessary labour time|socially necessary amount of labour time]] to produce the commodity.\n\nIn a capitalist economy, workers are paid according to this value and value is the source of all wealth. Value is determined by a good's particular utility for an actor and if the good results from human activity, it must be understood as a product of concrete labour, qualitatively defined labour. Capitalists are able to purchase labour power from the workers, who can only bring their own labour power in the market. Once capitalists are able to pay the worker less than the value produced by their labour, surplus labour forms and this results in the capitalists' profits. This is what Marx meant by \"[[surplus value]]\", which he saw as \"an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital, or of the laborer by the capitalist\".<ref>Marx, Karl. [1867] 1967. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, vol. 1. New York: International Publishers.</ref> This profit is used to pay for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] and personal consumption by the capitalist, but was most importantly used to accelerate growth and thus promote a greater system of exploitation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe degree of exploitation of labour power is dictated by the rate of surplus value as the proportion between surplus value/[[Surplus product|product]] and necessary value/product. The surplus value/product is the materialized surplus labour or surplus labour time while the necessary value/product is materialized necessary labour in regard to workers, like the reproduction of the labour power.<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\" /> Marx called the rate of surplus value an \"exact expression of the degree of exploitation of labour power by capital\".<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital'', Vol. 1, as translated in J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 233, {{ISBN|978-90-04-32331-5}}, which also explains the significance of the difference between this translation of Marx's phrase, and the translation reproduced earlier in this Wikipedia entry, which, Furner argues, is wrong. </ref> These theories ultimately demonstrate Marx's main issue with capitalism: it was not that capitalism was not an institution where the labour exchange is coercive, but that in this institution one class still becomes significantly more rich while the other becomes impoverished.\n\n=== Critique and rejection ===\nMany capitalist critics have pointed out that Marx assumes that capital owners contribute nothing to the process of production. They suggest that Marx should have allowed for two things; namely, permit a fair profit on the risk of capital investment and allow for the efforts of management be paid their due.\n\n[[David Ramsay Steele]] argues that [[Marginal productivity|marginal productivity theory]] renders Marx's theory of exploitation untenable. According to this theoretical framework and assuming competitive market conditions, a worker's compensation is determined by his or her contribution to marginal output. Similarly, owners of machines and real estate are compensated according to the marginal productivity of their capital's contribution to marginal output. However, Steele notes that this does not in any way touch the ethical argument of socialists who acknowledge non-labour contributions to marginal output, but contend that it is illegitimate for a class of passive owners to receive an [[unearned income]] from ownership of capital and land.<ref>{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 143|quote= One of the fateful consequences of marginal productivity is that it sweeps away such theories as Marx\u2019s which see interest as \u2018unpaid labour\u2019. Under competitive market conditions, a worker tends to be paid what his labour contributes to output, no more and no less. The same goes for an owner of a machine or piece of real estate. The analysis demonstrates the symmetry of all types of inputs: there is as much sense as saying that labour exploits capital, or that electricity exploits roofing tiles. Of course, this does not touch the ethical arguments of socialists who acknowledge that non-labour factors make a determinate contribution to output, analytically separable from labour\u2019s contribution, yet still contend that it is illegitimate for anyone to own capital or land and reap the payment for their services. But that is not the position of Marx, nor many other socialists. }}</ref>\n\n[[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai]] observed that there is also the prospect of surplus value arising from sources other than labour and a classic given example is winemaking. When grapes are harvested and crushed, labour is used. However, when yeast is added and the grape juice is left to ferment in order to get wine, the value of wine exceeds that of the grapes significantly, yet labour contributes nothing to the extra value. Marx had ignored capital inputs due to placing them all together in constant capital\u2014translating the wear and tear of capital in production in terms of its labour value. Yet examples such as this demonstrated that value and surplus value could come from somewhere other than labour.<ref>Desai, Meghnad, ''Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism'', 2002, Verso Books, page 264</ref> \n\nThe theory has been opposed by [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]], among others. In ''History and Critique of Interest Theories'' (1884), he argues that capitalists do not exploit their workers, as they actually help employees by providing them with an income well in advance of the revenue from the goods they produced, stating: \"Labor cannot increase its share at the expense of capital\". In particular, he argues that the theory of exploitation ignores the dimension of time in production. From this criticism, it follows that, according to B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, the whole value of a product is not produced by the worker, but that labour can only be paid at the present value of any foreseeable output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/story/1680 |title=B\u00f6hm-Bawerk\u2019s Critique of the Exploitation Theory of Interest &#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref>\n\n[[John Roemer]] studied and criticized Marx's theory by putting forth a model to deal with exploitation in all modes of production, hoping to lay the foundations for an analysis of the laws of motion of socialism. In his works published in the 1980s, Roemer posits a model of exploitation based upon unequal ownership of human (physical labour skills) and non-human property (land and means of production). He states that this model of property rights has great superiority over the conventional surplus labour model of exploitation, therefore rejecting the labour theory of value.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/> In his attempt to put forward a theory of exploitation that also includes feudal, capitalist and socialist modes of production, he defines exploitation in each of the modes in terms of property rights. Roemer rejects the labour theory of value because he sees that exploitation can exist in the absence of employment relations, like in a subsistence economy, therefore backing the model of exploitation that is based on property rights. He tests his theory of exploitation using game theory to construct contingently feasible alternative states where the exploited agents could improve their welfare by withdrawing with their share of society's alienable and inalienable assets.<ref name=\"John E. Roemer 1985, pg 30-65\"/> Feudal, capitalist and socialist exploitation all come from the theory of exploitation on the basis of inequitable distribution of property rights. There has been a range of agreement and disagreement from various economists, neo-classical economists favoring the model the most.\n\nSome theorists criticize Roemer for his entire rejection of the labour theory of value and the surplus labour approach to exploitation, for they were the central aspects of Marxist thought in regard to exploitation.<ref>Khalid Nadvi, 'Exploitation and Labour Theory Of Value: A Critique of Roemer's Theory of Exploitation and Class', ''Economic and Political Weekly'', Vol. 20, No. 25, 1985, 1479-1494</ref> Others criticize his commitment to a specifically liberal as opposed to a Marxist account of the wrongs of exploitation.<ref>For example, [[Allen W. Wood]], ''Karl Marx'' (Routledge 2004) and [[Nicolas Vrousalis]], 'Exploitation, Vulnerability and Social Domination', ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', Vol. 41, 2013, 131-157</ref>\n\n== Other theories ==\n=== Liberal theory ===\n{{liberalism sidebar}}\nMany assume that [[liberalism]] intrinsically lacks any adequate theory of exploitation because its phenomenon commits itself only to the primacy of personal rights and liberties and to individual choice as the basic explanatory datum. [[Hillel Steiner]] provided an argument to refute the claim that liberalism cannot supply an adequate theory of exploitation.<ref>Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', ''Ethics'', Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 225-241</ref> He discusses interpersonal transfers and how there are three types: donation, exchange and theft. Exchange is the only of the three that consists of a voluntary bilateral transfer, where the beneficiary receives something at a value greater than zero on the shared scale of value, although at times there can be ambiguity between more complex types of transfer. He describes the three dimensions of transfers as either unilateral/bilateral, voluntary/involuntary and equal/unequal. Despite these types of transfers being able to distinguish the differences in the four types of transfers, it is not enough to provide a differentiating characterization of exploitation. Unlike theft, an exploitative transfer is bilateral and the items are transferred voluntarily at both unequal and greater-than-zero value. The difference between a benefit and exploitation despite their various shared features is a difference between their counterfactual presuppositions, meaning that in an exploitation there is a voluntary bilateral transfer of unequally valued items because the possessors of both items would voluntarily make the transfer if the items to be transferred were of equal value, but in a benefit the possessor of the higher-value item would not voluntarily make the transfer if the items were at equal value. Put simply, the exploitation can be converted to an exchange: both exploiters and exploited would voluntarily become exchangers when benefactors would not.\n\nIn an exploitation both transfers are voluntary, but part of one of the two transfers is unnecessary. The circumstances that bring out exploitation are not the same as what brings about exploitative transfers. Exploitative circumstance is due to the factors other than what motivates individuals to engage in nonaltruistic bilateral transfers (exchanges and exploitations) as they are not sufficient circumstances to bring about exploitative transfers.\n\nTo further explain the occurrence of exploitative circumstances certain generalizations about social relations must be included to supply generalizations about social institutions. He saysthat 'if (i) certain things are true of the institutions within which interpersonal transfers occur and (ii) at least some of these transfers are nonaltruistic bilateral ones, then at least some of these transfers are exploitative.<ref>Hillel Steiner, 'A Liberal Theory of Exploitation', ''Ethics'', Vol. 94, No. 2, 1984, pp. 229</ref> Steiner looks at the institutional conditions of exploitation and finds that in general exploitation is considered unjust and to understand why it is necessary to look at the concept of a right, an inviolable domain of practical choice and the way rights are established to form social institutions. Institutional exploitation can be illustrated by schematized forms of exploitation to reach two points:\n:#Despite the mode of deprivation in exploitation, it is not the same as the mode involved in a violation of rights and it does result from such violations and the two deprivations may be of the same value.\n:#Rights violation (theft) is a bilateral relation, but exploitation is trilateral one. There are at least three persons needed for exploitation.\n\nOn a liberal view, exploitation can be described as a quadrilateral relation between four relevantly distinct parties: the state, the exploited, the exploiter and those who suffer rights violations. However, it can be argued that the state's interests with the exploiters action can be viewed as unimpeachable because you cannot imply that the exploiter would ever withhold consent from exploiting due to altruistic concerns. So this trilateral conception of exploitation identifies exploited, exploiters and sufferers of rights violations.\n\nIn terms of ridding exploitation, the standard liberal view holds that a regime of ''laissez-faire'' is a necessary condition. Natural rights thinkers [[Henry George]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] reject this view and claim that property rights belong to everyone, i.e. that all land to be valid must belong to everyone. Their argument aims to show that traditional liberalism is mistaken in holding that nonintervention in commerce is the key to non exploitation and they argue it is necessary, but not sufficient.\n\n=== Neoclassical notions ===\nThe majority of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] only would view exploitation existing as an abstract deduction of the classic school and of [[David Ricardo#Ricardo's theories of wages and profits|Ricardo's theory of surplus-value]].<ref name=\"Jon Elster pp. 3-17\"/> However, in some neoclassical economic theories exploitation is defined by the unequal marginal productivity of workers and wages, such that wages are lower. Exploitation is sometimes viewed to occur when a necessary agent of production receives less wages than its marginal product.<ref>J. Schumpter, ''The theory of economic development'', Harvard University Press, 1949</ref> Neoclassical theorists also identify the need for some type of [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution of income]] to the poor, disabled, to the farmers and peasants, or whatever socially alienated group from the [[social welfare function]]. However, it is not true that neoclassical economists would accept the marginal productivity theory of just income as a general principle like other theorists do when addressing exploitation. The general neoclassical view sees that all factors can be simultaneously rewarded according to their marginal productivity: this means that factors of production should be awarded according to their marginal productivity as well, Euler's [[Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions|theorem for homogeneous function]] of the first order proves this:\n:''f''(K,L)= ''f''<sub>K</sub>(K,L)K+''f''<sub>L</sub>(K,L)L\nThe production function where K is capital and L is labour. Neoclassical theory requires that ''f'' be continuously differentiable in both variables and that there are constant returns to scale. If there are constant returns to scale, there will be perfect equilibrium if both capital and labour are rewarded according to their marginal products, exactly exhausting the total product.\n\nThe primary concept is that there is exploitation towards a factor of production, if it receives less than its marginal product. Exploitation can only occur in imperfect capitalism due to imperfect competition, with the neoclassical notion of productivity wages there is little to no exploitation in the economy.<ref>Milan Zafirovski, 'Measuring and Making Sense of Labor Exploitation in Contemporary Society: A Comparative Analysis', ''Review of Radical Political Economies'', 2003, Vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 462-484</ref> This blames [[monopoly]] in the product market, [[monopsony]] in the labour market and [[cartel]]lization as the main causes for exploitation of workers.\n\n== In developing nations ==\n[[Developing country|Developing nations]], commonly called [[Third World]] countries, are the focus of much debate over the issue of exploitation, particularly in the context of the global economy.\n\nCritics of foreign companies allege that firms such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap Inc.]] resort to [[child labour]] and [[sweatshop]]s in [[developing nations]], paying their workers wages far lower than those that prevail in [[developed nations]] (where the products are sold). It is argued that this is insufficient to allow workers to attain the local subsistence standard of living if working hours common in the [[First World]] are observed, so that working hours much longer than in the first world are necessary. It is also argued that work conditions in these developing world factories are more unsafe and much more unhealthy than in the First World. For example, observers point to cases where employees were unable to escape factories burning down\u2014and thus dying\u2014because of locked doors, a common signal that sweatshop conditions exist, similar to the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] of 1911.\n\nOthers argue that in the absence of compulsion the only way that corporations are able to secure adequate supplies of labour is to offer wages and benefits superior to preexisting options and that the presence of workers in corporate factories indicates that the factories present options which are seen as better\u2014by the workers themselves\u2014than the other options available to them (see [[principle of revealed preference]]).\n\nA common response is that this is disingenuous as the companies are in fact exploiting people by the terms of unequal human standards (applying lower standards to their Third World workers than to their First World ones). Furthermore, the argument goes that if people choose to work for low wages and in unsafe conditions because it is their only alternative to starvation or scavenging from garbage dumps (the \"preexisting options\"), this cannot be seen as any kind of \"free choice\" on their part. It also argued that if a company intends to sell its products in the First World, it should pay its workers by First World standards.\n\nFollowing such a view, some in the [[United States]] propose that the American government should mandate that businesses in foreign countries adhere to the same labour, environmental, health and safety standards as the United States before they are allowed to trade with businesses in the United States (this has been advocated by [[Howard Dean]], for example). They believe that such standards would improve the [[quality of life]] in less developed nations.\n\nAccording to others, this would harm the economies of less developed nations by discouraging the United States from investing in them. [[Milton Friedman]] was an economist who thought that such a policy would have that effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawkins |first=John |url=http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/friedman.php |title=An Interview With Milton Friedman &#124; John Hawkins' Right Wing News |publisher=Rightwingnews.com |date=2015-03-25 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref> According to this argument, the result of ending perceived exploitation would therefore be the corporation pulling back to its developed nation, leaving their former workers out of a job.\n\nGroups who see themselves as fighting against global exploitation also point to secondary effects such as the dumping of government-subsidized corn on developing world markets which forces subsistence farmers off of their lands, sending them into the cities or across borders in order to survive. More generally, some sort of international regulation of [[multinational corporations|transnational corporations]] is called for, such as the enforcement of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s labour standards.\n\nThe [[fair trade]] movement seeks to ensure a more equitable treatment of producers and workers, therefore minimizing exploitation of labour forces in developing countries. The exploitation of labour is not limited to the aforementioned large scale corporate outsourcing, but it can also be found within the inherent structure of local markets in developing countries like Kenya.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martinus van Tilborgh |url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/mission/how-do-we-find-our-artists |title=How do we find our artists |publisher=Villagemarkets.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref>\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{main|Labour economics}}\n{{see also|Wage slavery}}\n{{labour}}\nWage labour as institutionalized under today's market economic systems has been criticized,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> especially by both mainstream [[Socialism|socialists]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]],<ref name=\"English Working Class p. 599\">{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.</ref><ref name=\"English Working Class p. 912\">{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.</ref><ref name=\"Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133\">{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.</ref><ref name=\"Shop Floor p. 37\">{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.</ref> utilising the pejorative term [[wage slavery]].<ref name=\"merriam-webster.com\">{{cite web |title= Wage Slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> They regard the trade of labour as a commodity as a form of economic exploitation rooting partially from [[capitalism]].\n\nAs per [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era.

After struggling to break into the first team, he was loaned out to [[Championnat National]] side [[US Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Ligue 2]] side [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]] in consecutive seasons. He enjoyed prolific spells with both clubs, scoring 39 goals between them, before returning to Bordeaux. After initially being promised an increased role after his successful loans, Sala fell out of favour again, and instead, joined fellow [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] on loan.\n\nIn 2015, he signed for [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] on a permanent basis. With Nantes, he made more than 100 appearances in Ligue 1, and achieved a successful goalscoring record, finishing as the club's top goalscorer for three consecutive seasons. His form prompted a move to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in January 2019, for a club record fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million (\u20ac18&nbsp;million).\n\nSala [[2019 Piper PA-46 Malibu crash|died in a plane crash]] off [[Alderney]] on 21&nbsp;January 2019. He was a passenger aboard a [[Piper PA-46|Piper Malibu]] light aircraft flying from Nantes to Cardiff. An initial three-day search covered {{convert|1,700|sqmi|km2}} across the English Channel.

Sala Taffarel''' ({{IPA-es|emi\u02c8ljano \u02c8sala}}; 31 October 1990 \u2013 21 January 2019; confirmed dead 7 February 2019) was an Argentine professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].\n\nAfter playing youth football in Argentina and following a short spell in [[Portuguese football league system|Portugal's regional leagues]], Sala began his professional career in France with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], making his professional debut in February 2012. After struggling to break into the first team, he was loaned out to [[Championnat National]] side [[US Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Ligue 2]] side [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]] in consecutive seasons. He enjoyed prolific spells with both clubs, scoring 39 goals between them, before returning to Bordeaux. After initially being promised an increased role after his successful loans, Sala fell out of favour again, and instead, joined fellow [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] on loan.\n\nIn 2015, he signed for [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] on a permanent basis. With Nantes, he made more than 100 appearances in Ligue 1, and achieved a successful goalscoring record, finishing as the club's top goalscorer for three consecutive seasons. His form prompted a move to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in January 2019, for a club record fee of \u00a315&nbsp;million (\u20ac18&nbsp;million).\n\nSala [[2019 Piper PA-46 Malibu crash|died in a plane crash]] off [[Alderney]] on 21&nbsp;January 2019. He was a passenger aboard a [[Piper PA-46|Piper Malibu]] light aircraft flying from Nantes to Cardiff. An initial three-day search covered {{convert|1,700|sqmi|km2}} across the English Channel. Two subsequent private searches were launched, resulting in the discovery of the wreckage on 3&nbsp;February; Sala's body was recovered four days later.\n\n==Early life and personal life==\nSala was born in the town of Culul\u00fa, [[Santa Fe Province]], Argentina, to Horacio Sala and Mercedes Taffarel.<ref name=\"vaaju\">{{cite news |url=https://vaaju.com/colombiaeng/its-hopeless-you-cant-believe-emiliano-sala-father-after-the-disappearance-of-the-flight/ |title=\"It's hopeless, you can't believe\": Emiliano Sala father after the disappearance of the flight |website=vaaju.com |date=22 January 2019 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/missing-plane-latest-emiliano-sala-feared-to-be-on-board-flight-travelling-to-cardiff-from-nantes-a4045271.html |title=Emiliano Sala feared dead: desperate hunt for missing plane with Cardiff City's new \u00a315m striker on board called off for the night |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=22 January 2019 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> His father worked as a truck driver; the family later moved to Progreso.<ref name=\"vaaju\" /><ref name=\"fight\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sofoot.com/emiliano-sala-quand-je-veux-quelque-chose-je-me-bats-439685.html |title=Emiliano Sala: Quand je Veux Quelque Chose je Me Bats |website=sofoot.com |language=French |last=Bories |first=Flavien |date=5 March 2017 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> He held an Italian passport.<ref name=\"vaaju\" /> He had a brother, Dario, and a sister, Romina.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/internacional/20190122/454262138384/dario-hermano-de-sala-lo-unico-que-ha-hecho-toda-su-vida-es-estar-con-la-pelota.html |title=Dar\u00edo, hermano de Sala: \"Lo \u00fanico que ha hecho toda su vida es estar con la pelota |publisher=Mundo Deportivo |last=Furlone |first=Aquiles |date=22 January 2019 |access-date=23 January 2019 |language=Spanish}}</ref> He was a fan of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]] and,<ref name=\"shock\">{{cite news |url=https://www.ole.com.ar/fuera-de-juego/pueblo-frances-shock_0_rkJWdSzki3e.html |title=Todo el pueblo franc\u00e9s est\u00e1 en shock |publisher=Ol\u00e9 |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=26 January 2019 |language=Spanish}}</ref> while growing up, he studied footage of his favourite footballer, [[Gabriel Batistuta]].<ref name=\"Batistuta\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sofoot.com/sala-j-ai-beaucoup-regarde-batistuta-180559.html |title=Sala: J'ai Beaucoup Regarde Batistuta |website=sofoot.com |language=French |last=Bougis |first=Axel |date=14 February 2014 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref>  Sala\u2019s father, Horacio, died of a heart attack on 26 April 2019, three months after his son's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48065204|title=Sala's dad dies three months after son|date=2019-04-26|access-date=2019-04-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nSala began playing football for San Mart\u00edn de Progreso, where he remained until he was 15 years old.<ref name=\"Joven\">{{cite news |url=http://www.elsantafesino.com/la-region/2007/09/08/6362 |title=Joven futbolista de Progreso tiene su destino en Espa\u00f1a |publisher=El Santafesino |date=9 September 2007 |access-date=22 January 2019 |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617022848/http://www.elsantafesino.com/la-region/2007/09/08/6362 |archive-date=17 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Diax\">{{cite news |url=http://www.esperanzadiaxdia.com.ar/emiliano-sala-jugara-en-la-premier-league-de-inglaterra/ |title=Emiliano Sala jugar\u00e1 en la Premier League de Inglaterra |publisher=Diaxdia |language=Spanish|date=21 January 2019 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> He then moved to [[San Francisco, C\u00f3rdoba]] to play at football school Proyecto Crecer after being spotted by a scout.<ref name=\"Joven\" /><ref name=\"Diax\" /><ref name=\"fight\" /> The club was directly affiliated with Spanish club [[RCD Mallorca]] and French side [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], scouting local players in the area.<ref name=\"Joven\" /> After joining the club, he moved into a boarding house with other players from the club's youth system.<ref name=\"fight\" /> He played six Preferente matches for Spanish club CD Soledad B between October 2007 and February 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://puntobalonbalear.es/perfil/emiliano-r-sala/temporada/2007-2008/|title=Partidos -
