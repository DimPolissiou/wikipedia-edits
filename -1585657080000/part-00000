Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients.

Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when [[solicitor]] Brian Burgess informed her that a [[will and testament|will]] had been made, apparently by her mother; there were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left \u00a3386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict, and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, examination of his computer showed that they were written after her death.

The [[1917 Stanley Cup Finals|1917]] Metropolitans were the first American-based team to win the [[Stanley Cup]], but folded in 1924, while the [[Seattle Totems]] played in the minor [[Western Hockey League (1952\u20131974)|Western Hockey League]] (WHL) from 1944 until the WHL's dissolution in 1975. On June 12, 1974, the NHL announced that a Seattle group headed by Vince Abbey of the Totems had been awarded an expansion team to begin play in the [[1976\u201377 NHL season|1976\u201377 season]] along with a team in [[Denver Spurs|Denver]].<ref name=\"Times-1974\">{{cite news |last=Parietti |first=Walt |date=June 12, 1974 |title=Seattle gets N.H.L. franchise |page=F1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> The team, which according to season ticket promotions would have kept the WHL name of Totems, never came to fruition because of the original WHL's instability (the WHL was shut down the day the potential NHL team was announced), the inability of Abbey to gather the necessary funding and meet deadlines, and the poor performances on the ice and at the box office of 1974 expansion teams the [[Washington Capitals]] and the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. Abbey later came up short in bid to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and move the team to Seattle when they were sold in a [[bankruptcy]] auction for $4.4 million in June 1975.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 30, 1975 |title=Seattle group bids today for Penguins |page=F1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\nA second attempt at an NHL expansion team in Seattle by a local group was made in 1990, but it failed again over the financial terms the NHL demanded. Then-Sonics owner [[Barry Ackerley]] committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990 deadline as part of a proposed new arena deal. His son Bill would head the expansion effort, while a competing group led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach [[Bill MacFarland]] was preparing their own application. With the Ackerley application already submitted, the two groups would merge with Larson and MacFarland being primary points of contact with the NHL. Then owner of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Bill Yuill, also joined the group. Larson and MacFarland, along with Barry Ackerley and Bill Lear, Ackerley's financial advisor, were set to make a presentation to the NHL's Board of Governors on December 5, 1990. At the meeting, Ackerley and Lear asked to meet with the board first, promptly withdrew their application, and left. Larson and MacFarland were stunned to learn of the development but were unable to pursue any recourse as their names were never on the submitted application.<ref>{{cite web|last=Obermeyer |first=Jeff |url=http://www.seattlehockey.net/Seattle_Hockey_Homepage/Seattle_and_the_NHL.html |title=Seattle and the NHL:  So Close Yet So Far Away. |publisher=NW Hockey Report, SeattleHockey.net |date=Mar-Apr 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Eskenazi |first1=David |last2=Rudman |first2=Steve |url=http://sportspressnw.com/2155236/2013/wayback-machine-seattles-long-wait-for-nhl |title=WAYBACK MACHINE: SEATTLE\u2019S LONG WAIT FOR NHL |publisher=Sportspress NW |date=July 9, 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref> Thought to play a factor in Ackerley's decision were the significant demands by the NHL for an expansion team: a $50 million expansion fee that was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a $5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets weren't sold in the first year\u2014the Sonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least $9 million annually, which would've made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a \"substantial\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured $5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point.

The [[1917 Stanley Cup Finals|1917]] Metropolitans were the first American-based team to win the [[Stanley Cup]], but folded in 1924, while the [[Seattle Totems]] played in the minor [[Western Hockey League (1952\u20131974)|Western Hockey League]] (WHL) from 1944 until the WHL's dissolution in 1975. On June 12, 1974, the NHL announced that a Seattle group headed by Vince Abbey of the Totems had been awarded an expansion team to begin play in the [[1976\u201377 NHL season|1976\u201377 season]] along with a team in [[Denver Spurs|Denver]].<ref name=\"Times-1974\">{{cite news |last=Parietti |first=Walt |date=June 12, 1974 |title=Seattle gets N.H.L. franchise |page=F1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> The team, which according to season ticket promotions would have kept the WHL name of Totems, never came to fruition because of the original WHL's instability (the WHL was shut down the day the potential NHL team was announced), the inability of Abbey to gather the necessary funding and meet deadlines, and the poor performances on the ice and at the box office of 1974 expansion teams the [[Washington Capitals]] and the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. Abbey later came up short in bid to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and move the team to Seattle when they were sold in a [[bankruptcy]] auction for $4.4 million in June 1975.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 30, 1975 |title=Seattle group bids today for Penguins |page=F1 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\nA second attempt at an NHL expansion team in Seattle by a local group was made in 1990, but it failed again over the financial terms the NHL demanded. Then-Sonics owner [[Barry Ackerley]] committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990 deadline as part of a proposed new arena deal. His son Bill would head the expansion effort, while a competing group led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach [[Bill MacFarland]] was preparing their own application. With the Ackerley application already submitted, the two groups would merge with Larson and MacFarland being primary points of contact with the NHL. Then owner of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Bill Yuill, also joined the group. Larson and MacFarland, along with Barry Ackerley and Bill Lear, Ackerley's financial advisor, were set to make a presentation to the NHL's Board of Governors on December 5, 1990. At the meeting, Ackerley and Lear asked to meet with the board first, promptly withdrew their application, and left. Larson and MacFarland were stunned to learn of the development but were unable to pursue any recourse as their names were never on the submitted application.<ref>{{cite web|last=Obermeyer |first=Jeff |url=http://www.seattlehockey.net/Seattle_Hockey_Homepage/Seattle_and_the_NHL.html |title=Seattle and the NHL:  So Close Yet So Far Away. |publisher=NW Hockey Report, SeattleHockey.net |date=Mar-Apr 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Eskenazi |first1=David |last2=Rudman |first2=Steve |url=http://sportspressnw.com/2155236/2013/wayback-machine-seattles-long-wait-for-nhl |title=WAYBACK MACHINE: SEATTLE\u2019S LONG WAIT FOR NHL |publisher=Sportspress NW |date=July 9, 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref> Thought to play a factor in Ackerley's decision were the significant demands by the NHL for an expansion team: a $50 million expansion fee that was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a $5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets weren't sold in the first year\u2014the Sonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least $9 million annually, which would've made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a \"substantial\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured $5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point.

The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]]. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. \n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Thandie Newton.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. Waters arrives at a crime scene where the body of a \"dead kid\" has been discovered. Earlier the previous day, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri are in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]].\" Farhad is forced to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. \n\nLater that night, two black men, Anthony and Peter, [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. At the couple's house, the Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean arguing with Rick, demanding that the locks be changed again as she suspects that Daniel is a gangster due to his tattoos and outfit. Daniel places the keys of the new locks on the kitchen counter and leaves.\n\nSergeant John Ryan and his partner Officer Tom Hansen pull over an [[SUV]] being driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. \n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters gets a phone call from his mother with dementia while having sex with his partner, Ria, which leads to an argument about her ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\nRyan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop.\n\nFarhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush, but as he confronts Daniel and shoots, Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. He gives the gun to his daughter who is then seen going over near the cash register to retrieve the box of gun cartridges that her father had not known were actually blanks.\n\nHansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, who fled from the carjacking that took place earlier. Throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the \"dead kid\". Waters is [[disowned]] by his mother for not finding Peter alive. \n\nAnthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. After driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and setting the Cambodian people free, he passes by a car crash where, once again, an exchange of racially charged insults takes place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}} \n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Det.

And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment.

The film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]]. A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, ''Crash'' was inspired by a real-life incident in which his [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref>''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.</ref> The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]],  [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].\n\n''Crash'' first premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005 by [[Lionsgate Films]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]]. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. \n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Thandie Newton.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. Waters arrives at a crime scene where the body of a \"dead kid\" has been discovered. Earlier the previous day, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri are in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]].\" Farhad is forced to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. \n\nLater that night, two black men, Anthony and Peter, [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. At the couple's house, the Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean arguing with Rick, demanding that the locks be changed again as she suspects that Daniel is a gangster due to his tattoos and outfit. Daniel places the keys of the new locks on the kitchen counter and leaves.\n\nSergeant John Ryan and his partner Officer Tom Hansen pull over an [[SUV]] being driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. \n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters gets a phone call from his mother with dementia while having sex with his partner, Ria, which leads to an argument about her ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\nRyan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop.\n\nFarhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush, but as he confronts Daniel and shoots, Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. He gives the gun to his daughter who is then seen going over near the cash register to retrieve the box of gun cartridges that her father had not known were actually blanks.\n\nHansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, who fled from the carjacking that took place earlier. Throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the \"dead kid\". Waters is [[disowned]] by his mother for not finding Peter alive. \n\nAnthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. After driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and setting the Cambodian people free, he passes by a car crash where, once again, an exchange of racially charged insults takes place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}} \n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Det.

And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment.
