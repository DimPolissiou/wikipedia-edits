He was the inventor of a precision boring machine that could bore cast iron cylinders, such as cannon barrels <ref> NAM Rodger 'The Command Of The Ocean' Penguin 2004, p.377 </ref> and those used in the [[steam engine]]s of [[James Watt]]. His boring machine has been called the first [[machine tool]].  He also developed a blowing device for [[blast furnace]]s that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJohn Wilkinson was born in [[Little Clifton]], [[Bridgefoot]], [[Cumberland]] (now part of [[Cumbria]]), the eldest son of [[Isaac Wilkinson]] and Mary Johnson. Isaac was then the [[potfounder]] at the [[blast furnace]] there,<ref>W. H. Chaloner, 'Isaac Wilkinson, potfounder' in L. S. Pressnell (ed.), ''Studies in the industrial revolution presented to T.S. Ashton'' (Athlone Press, Univ. of London 1960), 23\u201351.</ref> one of the first to use [[coke (fuel)|coke]] instead of charcoal, which was pioneered by [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]].\n\nJohn and his half-brother William, who was 17 years younger, were raised in a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] [[Presbyterian]] family and he was educated at a [[Dissenting academies|dissenting academy]] at Kendal, run by Dr [[Caleb Rotherham]].<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris J R</ref> His sister Mary married another non-conformist, [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1762.  Priestley also played a role in educating John's younger brother, William.\n\nIn 1745, when John was 17, he was apprenticed to a [[Liverpool]] merchant for five years and then entered into partnership with his father.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\nWhen his father moved to [[Bersham Ironworks|Bersham furnace]] near [[Wrexham]] in 1753 John remained at [[Kirkby Lonsdale]] in [[Westmorland]] where he married Ann Maudesley on 12 June 1755.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\n===Iron master===\n\nFrom 1755 John Wilkinson became a partner in the Bersham concern and in 1757 with partners, he erected a blast furnace at [[Willey, Shropshire|Willey]], near [[Broseley]] in Shropshire.<ref>B. Trinder, ''The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire'' (2000), 42.</ref> Later he built another furnace and works at New Willey.  He made his home in Broseley in a house called 'The Lawns' which became his headquarters for many years.  He had houses either side of 'The Lawns' which served for administration, one being named 'The Mint' used for distribution of the thousands of tokens, each valued equivalent to a halfpenny.  In East Shropshire he also developed iron works at Snedshill, Hollinswood, [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]] and [[Hampton Loade]].   He and Edward Blakeway also leased land to build another at [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]] works in [[Bilston]] parish, near [[Wolverhampton]].<ref>Herefordshire Record Office, E12/S/378, 20 October 1784.</ref> He became known as the Father of the extensive South Staffordshire iron industry with Bilston as the start of the [[Black Country]].   In 1761, he took over [[Bersham]] Ironworks as well.  Bradley became his largest and most successful enterprise, and was the site of extensive experiments in getting raw coal to substitute for [[Coke (coal)|coke]] in the production of [[cast iron]].  At its peak, it included a number of [[blast furnace]]s, a brick works, potteries, glass works, and [[rolling mill]]s.  The [[Birmingham Canal]] was subsequently built near the Bradley works.\n\n==Inventions==\nWilkinson was a prolific inventor of new products and processes, and especially anything connected with novel uses of cast iron. \n===Cannon boring machine===\nBersham became well known for high-quality casting and a producer of guns and cannon. Historically cannons had been cast with a core and then bored to remove imperfections, but in 1774 Wilkinson patented a technique for boring iron guns from a solid piece, rotating the gun barrel rather than the boring-bar. This technique made the guns more accurate and less likely to explode. While bronze cannon were already being bored from the solid, the boring of large naval iron cannon was novel. The patent was quashed in 1779 (the navy saw it as a monopoly and sought to overthrow it) but Wilkinson still remained a major manufacturer.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\nIn 1792 Wilkinson bought the [[Brymbo Hall]] estate in [[Denbighshire]], not far from Bersham, where furnaces and other plant were installed.<ref name=\"Harris\"/> After his death and the decline of his industrial empire, the ironworks lay idle for some years until in 1842.<ref>[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/brymbo_steelworks/scottish.htm Brymbo Steelworks \u2013 the Scottish connection], Wrexham County Borough Council</ref> It became once again an important works and eventually became [[Brymbo Steelworks]], which continued to operate until 1990.<ref name=wcbc2>[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/brymbo_steelworks/last_tap.htm Brymbo Steelworks \u2013 The last tap], Wrexham County Borough Council</ref>\n\n===Boring machine for steam engines===\n[[File:WattsSteamEngine.jpeg|thumbnail|240px|[[James Watts]] [[Steam engine]]]]\n\n[[James Watt]] had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain accurately bored cylinders for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston.  In 1774 John Wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool extended through the cylinder and was supported on both ends, unlike the [[cantilever]]ed borers then in use. With this machine he was able to bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton & Watt]]'s first commercial engine, and was given an exclusive contract for the provision of cylinders.<ref>{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Among his many inventions was a reversing [[rolling mill]] with two steam cylinders that made the process much more economical.\n\nJohn Wilkinson took a key interest in obtaining orders for these more efficient steam engines and other uses for cast iron from the owners of Cornish copper mines. As part of this interest he bought shares in eight of the mines to help provide capital.\n\n===Hydraulic blowing engine===\nIn 1757 Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] to increase the air blast through the [[tuyeres]] for blast furnaces, so improving the rate of production of cast iron.  The historian [[Joseph Needham]] likened Wilkinson's design to the one described in 1313 by the Chinese Imperial Government metallurgist [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] in his [[Wang Zhen (official)#Technical innovations|''Treatise on Agriculture'']].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention\n |last1=Temple\n |first1= Robert\n|authorlink= \n|author2=Joseph Needham\n|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster\n|location=New York\n|isbn= |pages=65\n| postscript = <Based on the works of Joseph Needham>}}\n</ref>\n\n==Iron Bridge==\n[[File:Ironbridge002.JPG|thumbnail|350px|[[The Iron Bridge]]]]\n\nIn 1775 John Wilkinson was the prime mover initiating the building of [[the Iron Bridge]] connecting the then-important industrial town of Broseley with the other side of the [[River Severn]].  His friend [[Thomas Farnolls Pritchard]], had written to him with plans for the bridge.  A committee of subscribers was formed, mostly including Broseley businessmen, to agree to the use of iron rather than wood or stone and obtain price quotations and an authorising act of Parliament.\n\nWilkinson's persuasion and drive held together the group support through several problems during the parliamentary process.  Had Wilkinson not succeeded in this and also drawn support from influential parliamentarians, the bridge might not have been built or might have been made of other materials.  Consequently, the name 'Ironbridge' would not have been coined for the district in Madeley; the area would not have attained the status of a [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Abraham Darby III]] was chosen as the preferred builder after quoting to build the bridge for \u00a33,150/-/-.  When construction started, Wilkinson sold his shares to Abraham Darby III in 1777, leaving the latter to steer the project to its successful conclusion in 1779 and be opened in 1781.\n\nIn 1787 he launched the first iron [[barge]], constructed in [[Broseley]]. He patented several other inventions.\n\n==Copper interests==\n[[File:Parys mountain.jpg|thumbnail|350px|[[Parys Mountain]] opencast copper mine]]\nJohn Wilkinson made his fortune selling good quality goods made of iron and reached his limit of investment expansion.  His expertise proved useful when he invested in many copper interests.  In 1761 the Royal Navy clad the hull of the frigate {{HMS|Alarm|1758|6}} with copper sheet to reduce the growth of marine biofouling and prevent attack by the [[Teredo navalis|Teredo shipworm]]. The drag from the hull growth cut the speed and the shipworm caused severe hull damage, especially in tropical waters. After the success of this work the Navy decreed that all ships should be clad and this created a large demand for copper that Wilkinson noted during his visits to shipyards.  He bought shares in eight Cornish copper mines and met [[Thomas Williams of Llanidan|Thomas Williams]], the 'Copper King' of the [[Parys Mountain]] mines in [[Anglesey]].  Besides supplying Williams with large quantities of plate and equipment, Wilkinson also supplied scrap for the process of recovery of copper from solution by cementation.  Wilkinson bought a 1/16th share in the Mona Mine at Parys Mountain and shares in Williams industries at [[Holywell, Flintshire]], St Helens, near Liverpool and [[Swansea]], South Wales.  Wilkinson and Williams worked together on several projects. They were amongst the first to issue trade tokens ('Willys' and 'Druids') to alleviate the shortage of small coins. Jointly they set up the Cornish Metal Company in 1785 as a marketing company for copper. Its aim was to ensure both a good return for the Cornish miners and a stable price for the users of copper. Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool.\n\nTo help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and [[Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Lead mines and works==\n\nWilkinson bought lead mines at [[Minera]] in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now [[Sychdyn]]) and Mold, also in Flintshire.  He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again.  His lead was exported through the port of [[Chester]]. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at [[Rotherhithe]], London.  This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at [[Dagenham]].\n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nWilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, Dr Joseph Priestley. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire]]. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston.\n\n==Family life, and death==\n\n[[File:Wilkinsontoken.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Wilkinson, as depicted on a 1793 [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] token struck by [[Matthew Boulton]]'s Soho Mint]]\nJohn married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her [[dowry]] helped to pay for a share in the [[New Willey Company]]. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls.\n\nBy 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain's cast iron.<ref>Soldon, p. 67</ref> He became \"a titan\" \u2013 very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric.  His \"iron madness\" reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several [[coffin]]s and a massive [[obelisk]] to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale-in-Cartmel]], now in [[Cumbria]]. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire|Sheriff of Denbighshire]] for 1799.<ref>{{cite book|title = Annals of the Counties and County Families of Wales|url = https://archive.org/details/annalsandantiqu00goog|first= Thomas|last= Nicholas}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 14 July 1808 at his works in [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]], probably from [[diabetes]]. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Lindale.\n\nHe left a very large estate in his will (more than \u00a3130,000 - equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130000|1808|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the [[Court of Chancery]]. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.<ref>Soldon, pp 347\u2013348</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Soldon, Norbert C.

Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool.\n\nTo help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and [[Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Lead mines and works==\n\nWilkinson bought lead mines at [[Minera]] in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now [[Sychdyn]]) and Mold, also in Flintshire.  He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again.  His lead was exported through the port of [[Chester]]. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at [[Rotherhithe]], London.  This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at [[Dagenham]].\n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nWilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, Dr Joseph Priestley. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire]]. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston.\n\n==Family life, and death==\n\n[[File:Wilkinsontoken.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Wilkinson, as depicted on a 1793 [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] token struck by [[Matthew Boulton]]'s Soho Mint]]\nJohn married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her [[dowry]] helped to pay for a share in the [[New Willey Company]]. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls.\n\nBy 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain's cast iron.<ref>Soldon, p. 67</ref> He became \"a titan\" \u2013 very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric.  His \"iron madness\" reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several [[coffin]]s and a massive [[obelisk]] to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale-in-Cartmel]], now in [[Cumbria]]. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire|Sheriff of Denbighshire]] for 1799.<ref>{{cite book|title = Annals of the Counties and County Families of Wales|url = https://archive.org/details/annalsandantiqu00goog|first= Thomas|last= Nicholas}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 14 July 1808 at his works in [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]], probably from [[diabetes]]. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Lindale.\n\nHe left a very large estate in his will (more than \u00a3130,000 - equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130000|1808|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the [[Court of Chancery]]. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.<ref>Soldon, pp 347\u2013348</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Soldon, Norbert C.

It is a medium-sized [[terrier]], although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. \n\nThe breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt [[rodents]]. Additionally, it is a [[hypoallergenic dog breed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.petmd.com/dog/slideshows/care/five-hypoallergenic-dogs |title=Five Hypoallergenic Dogs |publisher=PetMD |access-date=May 26, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the [[Cairn Terrier]], the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. \n\nOther related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's [[Pittenweem]] Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.\n\nThe breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at [[Cruft's]]. It has been in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]'', and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and the Scotch whisky [[Black & White (whisky)|Black & White]]. \n\nSeveral breed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed \"[[Craniomandibular osteopathy|westie jaw]]\" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a very energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around one hour per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=3082 |title=Breed Information Centre: West Highland Terrier |publisher=The Kennel Clib}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Westie Chloe.jpg|thumb| Westies have dense, thick [[Down hair|undercoat]] and a rough [[Guard hair|outer coat]]]]\nCommonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour.

The disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty [[gene]]. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the [[Great Dane]]. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. [[Radiographic testing]] can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then [[euthanasia]] may be the only medical option remaining.<ref name=\"ackerman1167\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\nThe breed is prone to skin disorders.<ref name=newterrier /> About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by [[atopic dermatitis]], a heritable chronic allergic skin condition.

It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including [[Beagle]]s and [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]]s. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme [[galactosylceramidase]]. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed.<ref name=\"ackerman105\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 105</ref> Another genetic condition that affects the breed is \"[[white dog shaker syndrome]]\". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]], the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the [[Yorkshire Terrier]] and the [[Dachshund]]. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and [[hypermetria]]. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"ackerman155\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 155</ref>\n\nOther less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of [[Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid]] are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid.

Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the \"Poltalloch Terrier\". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed.

A second club was subsequently set up, with the [[Countess of Aberdeen]] as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman.

It is a medium-sized [[terrier]], although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. \n\nThe breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt [[rodents]]. Additionally, it is a [[hypoallergenic dog breed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.petmd.com/dog/slideshows/care/five-hypoallergenic-dogs |title=Five Hypoallergenic Dogs |publisher=PetMD |access-date=May 26, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the [[Cairn Terrier]], the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. \n\nOther related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's [[Pittenweem]] Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.\n\nThe breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at [[Cruft's]]. It has been in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]'', and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and the Scotch whisky [[Black & White (whisky)|Black & White]]. \n\nSeveral breed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed \"[[Craniomandibular osteopathy|westie jaw]]\" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a very energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around one hour per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=3082 |title=Breed Information Centre: West Highland Terrier |publisher=The Kennel Clib}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Westie Chloe.jpg|thumb| Westies have dense, thick [[Down hair|undercoat]] and a rough [[Guard hair|outer coat]]]]\nCommonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour.

The disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty [[gene]]. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the [[Great Dane]]. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. [[Radiographic testing]] can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then [[euthanasia]] may be the only medical option remaining.<ref name=\"ackerman1167\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\nThe breed is prone to skin disorders.<ref name=newterrier /> About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by [[atopic dermatitis]], a heritable chronic allergic skin condition.

It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including [[Beagle]]s and [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]]s. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme [[galactosylceramidase]]. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed.<ref name=\"ackerman105\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 105</ref> Another genetic condition that affects the breed is \"[[white dog shaker syndrome]]\". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]], the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the [[Yorkshire Terrier]] and the [[Dachshund]]. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and [[hypermetria]]. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.<ref name=\"ackerman155\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 155</ref>\n\nOther less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of [[Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid]] are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and [[ataxia]], but is more commonly found in [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]s.<ref name=\"ackerman108\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 108</ref> A degeneration of the hip joint, known as [[Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome]], also occurs in the breed.<ref name=\"ackerman125\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 125</ref> However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the [[Australian Shepherd]] and the [[Miniature Pincher]].<ref name=\"ackerman126\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 126</ref> The breed is also one of the least likely to be affected by a [[luxating patella]], where the knee cap slips out of place.<ref name=\"ackerman134\">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 134</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1899 Scotties White.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photo of three terriers|Three Pittenweem Terriers, photographed in 1899]]\nScottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of [[James VI of Scotland]], who reigned between 1567 and 1625.

Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the \"Poltalloch Terrier\". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed.

A second club was subsequently set up, with the [[Countess of Aberdeen]] as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman. [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] recognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at [[Crufts]] for the first time in the same year.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907\u20131908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1908.

The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]].

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went.

The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E.

As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.
