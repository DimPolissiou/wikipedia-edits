The population was 2,662 at the 2010 census,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US4849860| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Mount Vernon town, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=September 2, 2016}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> up from 2,286 at the 2000 census.\n\n==History==\n\nMount Vernon started as a settlement near the Fanning Springs (on Holbrook Street south of the present town square). Affidavits filed to establish land titles soon after the [[Texas Revolution]] document the settlement by squatters in [[Spanish Texas]] commencing in 1818.\n\nBy 1848 the United States government established a post office, and in 1849 a formal town site was laid out on land donated by Stephen and Rebecca Keith for the town of Mount Vernon. Since there were two other Mount Vernons in Texas, the post office was called \"Keith\" and then \"Lone Star\" before the name \"Mount Vernon\" became available in 1875. Franklin County was carved out of [[Titus County, Texas|Titus County]] in 1875, and Mount Vernon was elected [[county seat]] in competition with other communities.\n\nThe county's economy was based in agriculture with corn and cotton, followed by over 500,000 peach trees in production in the 1920s, watermelons in the 1930s, and the state's top record production of [[cane syrup]] in the 1940s. The 1936 discovery of oil on C.G. Hughes' land in the north part of the county led to a more diversified economy, with oil production continuing today combined with light industry, manufacturing, and diverse agricultural endeavors. Mount Vernon, as county seat, was assured a continuing vital existence as the economic center for the county. The town boasted churches, doctors, lawyers, and many varied stores in a time before people had the ability to travel far. The town voted to incorporate in 1910 under a mayor/council form of government. In 1911 a bond issue was passed to create a public waterworks. Electric and gas utility service followed.\n\nThe downtown area reflects a small-town atmosphere. The central plaza has a picturesque [[gazebo]] and park benches. On the north side of the square is a classical revival 1912 white limestone courthouse with a chiming clock tower. The courthouse recently underwent an extensive restoration as part of the Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program and has been returned to its 1912 grandeur.\n\nHistory abounds in and around Mount Vernon. Over 50 homes built before World War I still stand around town and are marked with signs designating the original owners and year of construction. Tour maps are available at various locations including the Franklin County Historical Association Museums, Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, and Mount Vernon City Hall. There are over 20 official state historical markers in Franklin County. The Cherokee Trace runs along the eastern edge of the county south toward [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]]. The Choctaw Trail runs through the county toward [[Dallas]]. The [[Bankhead Highway]] remains as Mount Vernon's Main Street.<ref>Franklin County Historical Association</ref>\n\n==Museums and attractions==\n[[File:Mount Vernon May 2018 07 (Old Fire Station Museum).jpg|thumb|Fire Station Museum]]\n'''Fire Station Museum''' \u2013 Housed in the 1940 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]-financed fire station, changing exhibits from the permanent collection include nature and history displays of butterflies, bird eggs, violins, toys, seashells, antique tools, wood carvings, and Native American artifacts.

In March, community volunteers manned an office space provided by First National Bank (now serving as office for the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce), and opened the library for donations including books, furniture, and cash. An initial $5,192 was raised to establish the library as a member of the Northeast Texas Library System. Also needed was 3,500 books (donated or purchased) within a three-year period. By the close of 1977 the Key Club reported the library had received cash donations of $25,000 and had exceeded the three-year goal for accumulation of books.  The library opened to check out books and serve the public with a full-time librarian on April 1, 1977.  In December 1977, the First National Bank deeded the historic 1912 bank building to the county for use as the library.  In January 1979 the library opened the downstairs of its current location and in 1980 the library expanded to the second floor.  There have been several renovations made throughout the years, the latest in 1997.  Now, the beautifully restored building blends its unique history with a full-service modern library.  The ornate handcrafted ceiling, marble counters and original vault doors add to the beauty of this historic building. Franklin County Library is a must see when touring downtown Mount Vernon. The library is located at the corner of Main and Kaufman Streets.

The park consists of tennis courts, basketball courts, 2 playground areas, baseball field, a covered pavilion for family and social gatherings, and a walking trail. The park is located just south of the town square on Kaufman Street.

The population was 2,662 at the 2010 census,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US4849860| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Mount Vernon town, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=September 2, 2016}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> up from 2,286 at the 2000 census.\n\n==History==\n\nMount Vernon started as a settlement near the Fanning Springs (on Holbrook Street south of the present town square). Affidavits filed to establish land titles soon after the [[Texas Revolution]] document the settlement by squatters in [[Spanish Texas]] commencing in 1818.\n\nBy 1848 the United States government established a post office, and in 1849 a formal town site was laid out on land donated by Stephen and Rebecca Keith for the town of Mount Vernon. Since there were two other Mount Vernons in Texas, the post office was called \"Keith\" and then \"Lone Star\" before the name \"Mount Vernon\" became available in 1875. Franklin County was carved out of [[Titus County, Texas|Titus County]] in 1875, and Mount Vernon was elected [[county seat]] in competition with other communities.\n\nThe county's economy was based in agriculture with corn and cotton, followed by over 500,000 peach trees in production in the 1920s, watermelons in the 1930s, and the state's top record production of [[cane syrup]] in the 1940s. The 1936 discovery of oil on C.G. Hughes' land in the north part of the county led to a more diversified economy, with oil production continuing today combined with light industry, manufacturing, and diverse agricultural endeavors. Mount Vernon, as county seat, was assured a continuing vital existence as the economic center for the county. The town boasted churches, doctors, lawyers, and many varied stores in a time before people had the ability to travel far. The town voted to incorporate in 1910 under a mayor/council form of government. In 1911 a bond issue was passed to create a public waterworks. Electric and gas utility service followed.\n\nThe downtown area reflects a small-town atmosphere. The central plaza has a picturesque [[gazebo]] and park benches. On the north side of the square is a classical revival 1912 white limestone courthouse with a chiming clock tower. The courthouse recently underwent an extensive restoration as part of the Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program and has been returned to its 1912 grandeur.\n\nHistory abounds in and around Mount Vernon. Over 50 homes built before World War I still stand around town and are marked with signs designating the original owners and year of construction. Tour maps are available at various locations including the Franklin County Historical Association Museums, Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, and Mount Vernon City Hall. There are over 20 official state historical markers in Franklin County. The Cherokee Trace runs along the eastern edge of the county south toward [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]]. The Choctaw Trail runs through the county toward [[Dallas]]. The [[Bankhead Highway]] remains as Mount Vernon's Main Street.<ref>Franklin County Historical Association</ref>\n\n==Museums and attractions==\n[[File:Mount Vernon May 2018 07 (Old Fire Station Museum).jpg|thumb|Fire Station Museum]]\n'''Fire Station Museum''' \u2013 Housed in the 1940 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]-financed fire station, changing exhibits from the permanent collection include nature and history displays of butterflies, bird eggs, violins, toys, seashells, antique tools, wood carvings, and Native American artifacts.

In March, community volunteers manned an office space provided by First National Bank (now serving as office for the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce), and opened the library for donations including books, furniture, and cash. An initial $5,192 was raised to establish the library as a member of the Northeast Texas Library System. Also needed was 3,500 books (donated or purchased) within a three-year period. By the close of 1977 the Key Club reported the library had received cash donations of $25,000 and had exceeded the three-year goal for accumulation of books.  The library opened to check out books and serve the public with a full-time librarian on April 1, 1977.  In December 1977, the First National Bank deeded the historic 1912 bank building to the county for use as the library.  In January 1979 the library opened the downstairs of its current location and in 1980 the library expanded to the second floor.  There have been several renovations made throughout the years, the latest in 1997.  Now, the beautifully restored building blends its unique history with a full-service modern library.  The ornate handcrafted ceiling, marble counters and original vault doors add to the beauty of this historic building. Franklin County Library is a must see when touring downtown Mount Vernon. The library is located at the corner of Main and Kaufman Streets.
