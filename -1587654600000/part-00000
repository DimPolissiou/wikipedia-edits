[[Michel Martin]] is the current host of the program. \n\n''ATC'' was excluded from the NPR deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] so as not to compete with local stations airing the show.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynette |last=Clemetson |title=All Things Considered, NPR's Growing Clout Alarms Member Stations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/arts/all-things-considered-npr-s-growing-clout-alarms-member-stations.html |quote=NPR has a contract to program two Sirius channels, NPR Talk and NPR Now.

The program airs from 9-10 p.m. ET on weeknights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing 'The National Conversation With All Things Considered' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/819186570/introducing-the-national-conversation-with-all-things-considered |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe format is less rigid than that of ''Morning Edition'', with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than ''Morning Edition'', with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.\n\nThe program begins with the familiar Don Voegeli theme song<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/features/atc_theme/ |title=ATC Theme: The Story |website=[[All Songs Considered]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.\n\nThe first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.\n\nAt :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.\n\nAt the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.\n\nSegment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.\n\nSegment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.\n\nStations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.\n\n==Awards==\nMajor awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award|Robert F. Kennedy Award]].

[[Michel Martin]] is the current host of the program. \n\n''ATC'' was excluded from the NPR deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] so as not to compete with local stations airing the show.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynette |last=Clemetson |title=All Things Considered, NPR's Growing Clout Alarms Member Stations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/arts/all-things-considered-npr-s-growing-clout-alarms-member-stations.html |quote=NPR has a contract to program two Sirius channels, NPR Talk and NPR Now.

The program airs from 9-10 p.m. ET on weeknights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing 'The National Conversation With All Things Considered' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/819186570/introducing-the-national-conversation-with-all-things-considered |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe format is less rigid than that of ''Morning Edition'', with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than ''Morning Edition'', with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.\n\nThe program begins with the familiar Don Voegeli theme song<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/features/atc_theme/ |title=ATC Theme: The Story |website=[[All Songs Considered]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.\n\nThe first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.\n\nAt :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.\n\nAt the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.\n\nSegment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.\n\nSegment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.\n\nStations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.\n\n==Awards==\nMajor awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F.

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] were the main contenders in the election. Tilden won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]\u2014one vote shy of the 185 needed to win\u2014to Hayes's 165, with 20 electoral votes from four states unresolved. Both Tilden and Hayes electors submitted votes from these states; and each claimed victory over the other. \n\nFacing an unparalleled [[constitutional crisis]] and intense public pressure, the Democratic-controlled [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the Republican-controlled [[United States Senate|Senate]] agreed to formation of the [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] Electoral Commission to settle the election. It consisted of fifteen members: five each from the House and the Senate, plus five [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]]. Eight members were Republicans; seven were Democrats. The Commission ultimately voted along party lines to award all twenty disputed votes to Hayes, thus assuring his electoral victory by a margin of {{nowrap|185\u2013}}184. Congress, meeting in a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] on March 2, 1877, affirmed that decision, officially declaring Hayes the winner by one vote.\n\n==Election of 1876==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 140\n | image1 = President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg\n | image2 = SamuelJonesTilden.png\n | footer = Left: [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate. Right: [[Samuel J. Tilden]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate.\n}}\n\nThe presidential election was held on November 7, 1876, and Tilden carried his home state of New York and most of the South, while Hayes' strength lay in New England, the Midwest, and the West. Early returns suggested that Tilden had won the election, so many major newspapers prematurely reported a Democratic victory in their morning editions, while several other newspapers were more cautious. For example, the headline of ''[[The New York Times]]'' read: \"The Results Still Uncertain.\" \n\nThe returns in several states were tainted by allegations of electoral fraud, with each side claiming ballot boxes had been stuffed, ballots had been altered, and voters had been intimidated.\n\nIn Louisiana, early unofficial tallies indicated that Tilden had carried the state by over 6000 votes, but the Republican-controlled returning board rejected the votes from several areas, with over 15,000 votes (more than 13,000 of which were for Tilden) being rejected by reasons of fraud and voter intimidation. As a result, Hayes won Louisiana's eight electoral votes, while the Republican candidate won the governorship. In response, the Democratic Party instituted a rival state government under [[Francis T. Nicholls]], and this rival administration, in turn, certified that Tilden had won.<ref name=\"Hoogenboom\">[[Hoogenboom, Ari]]. (1995). ''Rutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President''. Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas.</ref>\n\nA nearly identical scenario played out in South Carolina, where initial returns suggested that Hayes had won the presidential election, while the Democratic candidate had won the gubernatorial contest. As in Louisiana, the Republican-controlled returning board rejected several thousand votes, ensuring the election of a Republican Governor and Legislature. The Democratic Party promptly organized a rival state government, under the leadership of [[Wade Hampton III]], who declared Tilden the victor in the presidential election.<ref name=\"Hoogenboom\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, the initial count showed Hayes ahead by 43 votes, but after corrections were made, Tilden took the lead by 94 votes. Subsequently, the returning board rejected numerous ballots, delivering the election to Hayes by nearly a thousand votes. The board also declared that the Republican candidate had won the gubernatorial election; however, the Florida Supreme Court overruled them, instead awarding the victory to Democrat [[George Franklin Drew]], who announced that Tilden had carried Florida.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\">[http://elections.harpweek.com/Controversy.htm \"Hayes v. Tilden: The Electoral College Controversy of 1876\u20131877.\" HarpWeek.]</ref>\n\nFurther complications arose in Oregon: although both sides acknowledged that Hayes had won the state, Tilden's supporters questioned the constitutional eligibility of John W. Watts, as the Hayes elector (The Constitution provides that \"no\u2026person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector.\") Watts was a United States [[postmaster]]; however, he resigned from his office a week after the election, long before the scheduled meeting of the Electoral College. Nevertheless, the state's Democratic Governor, [[LaFayette Grover]], removed Watts as an elector, replacing him with [[C. A. Cronin]] (a Tilden supporter).<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nOn December 6, 1876, the electors met in the state capitals to cast their ballots. In Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, both the Democratic and the Republican slates of electors assembled, and cast conflicting votes, while in Oregon Watts and Cronin both cast ballots. Thus, from each of these four states, two sets of returns were transmitted to Washington.\n\nTilden had won the popular vote by almost a quarter of a million votes, but he did not have a clear Electoral College majority. He received 184 uncontested electoral votes, while Hayes received 165, and both sides claimed the remaining twenty (4 from Florida, 8 from Louisiana, 7 from South Carolina, and one from Oregon). As 185 votes constituted an Electoral College majority, Tilden needed only one of the disputed votes, while Hayes needed all twenty.\n\n==Electoral Commission Act==\nThe election dispute gave rise to a [[constitutional crisis]]. Democrats, who fervently believed that they had been cheated, threatened: \"Tilden or Blood!\" Congressman [[Henry Watterson]] of Kentucky declared that an army of 100,000 men was prepared to march on Washington if Tilden was denied the presidency. Since the Constitution did not explicitly indicate how Electoral College disputes were to be resolved, Congress was forced to consider other methods to settle the crisis. Many Democrats argued that Congress as a whole should determine which certificates to count. However, the chances that this method would result in a harmonious settlement were slim, as the Democrats controlled the House, while the Republicans controlled the Senate. Several Hayes supporters, on the other hand, argued that the President pro tempore of the Senate had the authority to determine which certificates to count, because he was responsible for chairing the congressional session at which the electoral votes were to be tallied. Since the office of President pro tempore was occupied by a Republican, Senator [[Thomas W. Ferry]] of Michigan, this method would have favored Hayes. Still others proposed that the matter should be settled by the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nIn late December, both the House and the Senate each established a special committee charged with developing a mechanism to resolve the issue. The two committees ultimately settled upon creating a commission that would count the electoral votes and resolve questions arising during the count. Many Republicans objected to the idea, insisting that the President pro tempore should resolve the disputes himself. Rutherford Hayes charged that the bill was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Rehnquist\">Rehnquist, William H. (2004). ''Centennial Crisis: The Disputed Election of 1876.'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf.</ref> However, a sufficient number of Republicans joined the Democrats to ensure its passage. On January 25, 1877, the Senate voted in favor of the bill 47-17; the House did likewise the next day, 191-86. The Electoral Commission Act ({{USStat|19|227}}) was signed into law by President Grant on January 29, 1877.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nThe Act provided that the Electoral Commission was to consist of fifteen members: five representatives selected by the House, five senators selected by the Senate, four Supreme Court justices named in the law, and a fifth Supreme Court justice selected by the other four. The most senior justice was to serve as President of the Commission. Whenever two different electoral vote certificates arrived from any state, the Commission was empowered to determine which return was correct. The Commission's decisions could be overturned only by both houses of Congress.<ref name=\"Nagle\">Nagle, John. (2004). \"How Not to Count Votes.\" 104 Columbia Law Review 1732.</ref>\n\n==Membership of the Commission==\nOriginally, it was planned that the Commission would consist of seven [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], seven [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and one independent. Justice [[David Davis (senator)|David Davis]], who was widely regarded as a political independent, was supposed to be the fifteenth justice on the Commission. According to one historian, \"no one, perhaps not even Davis himself, knew which presidential candidate he preferred.\"<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Roy, Jr. (2003). ''Fraud of the Century. Rutherford B. Hayes, Samuel Tilden and the Stolen Election of 1876.'' New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref> Just as the Electoral Commission Bill was passing Congress, the [[Illinois General Assembly|Legislature of Illinois]] elected Davis to the Senate. Democrats in the Illinois Legislature believed that they had purchased Davis' support by voting for him. However, they had made a miscalculation; instead of staying on the Supreme Court so that he could serve on the Commission, he promptly resigned as a Justice in order to take his Senate seat.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nWith no independents left on the Supreme Court, the final seat on the Electoral Commission was given instead to Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]], a Republican. As a result, the GOP held a one-seat majority on the body. Bradley would, in every case, vote with his fellow Republicans to give the disputed electoral votes to Hayes.<ref name=\"Nagle\"/> The membership of the Commission was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Member (State)!!Body!!colspan=2|Party\n|-\n|{{sort|01|[[Josiah Gardner Abbott]] ([[Massachusetts]])}}||{{sort|01|House}}||style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\"| ||{{sort|01|Democratic}}\n|-\n|{{sort|02|[[Thomas F.

Tilden's lawyers argued that the Commission should investigate the actions of the state returning boards, and reverse those actions if necessary. Hayes' counsel, on the other hand, suggested that the Commission should merely accept the official returns certified by the state Governor without inquiring into their validity. To do otherwise, it was argued, would have violated the sovereignty of the states. The Commission voted 8\u20137, along party lines, in favor of the Republican position.\n\nSubsequently, in a series of party-line votes, the Commission awarded all twenty disputed electoral votes to Hayes. Under the Electoral Commission Act, the Commission's findings were final unless overruled by both houses of Congress. Although the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives repeatedly voted to reject the Commission's decisions, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to uphold them. Thus, Hayes' victory was assured.\n\n[[Image:1876 Electoral Map.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The final results of the presidential election of 1876 are shown above.]]\nUnable to overturn the Commission's decisions, many Democrats instead tried to obstruct them.

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] were the main contenders in the election. Tilden won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]\u2014one vote shy of the 185 needed to win\u2014to Hayes's 165, with 20 electoral votes from four states unresolved. Both Tilden and Hayes electors submitted votes from these states; and each claimed victory over the other. \n\nFacing an unparalleled [[constitutional crisis]] and intense public pressure, the Democratic-controlled [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the Republican-controlled [[United States Senate|Senate]] agreed to formation of the [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] Electoral Commission to settle the election. It consisted of fifteen members: five each from the House and the Senate, plus five [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]]. Eight members were Republicans; seven were Democrats. The Commission ultimately voted along party lines to award all twenty disputed votes to Hayes, thus assuring his electoral victory by a margin of {{nowrap|185\u2013}}184. Congress, meeting in a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] on March 2, 1877, affirmed that decision, officially declaring Hayes the winner by one vote.\n\n==Election of 1876==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 140\n | image1 = President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg\n | image2 = SamuelJonesTilden.png\n | footer = Left: [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate. Right: [[Samuel J. Tilden]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate.\n}}\n\nThe presidential election was held on November 7, 1876, and Tilden carried his home state of New York and most of the South, while Hayes' strength lay in New England, the Midwest, and the West. Early returns suggested that Tilden had won the election, so many major newspapers prematurely reported a Democratic victory in their morning editions, while several other newspapers were more cautious. For example, the headline of ''[[The New York Times]]'' read: \"The Results Still Uncertain.\" \n\nThe returns in several states were tainted by allegations of electoral fraud, with each side claiming ballot boxes had been stuffed, ballots had been altered, and voters had been intimidated.\n\nIn Louisiana, early unofficial tallies indicated that Tilden had carried the state by over 6000 votes, but the Republican-controlled returning board rejected the votes from several areas, with over 15,000 votes (more than 13,000 of which were for Tilden) being rejected by reasons of fraud and voter intimidation. As a result, Hayes won Louisiana's eight electoral votes, while the Republican candidate won the governorship. In response, the Democratic Party instituted a rival state government under [[Francis T. Nicholls]], and this rival administration, in turn, certified that Tilden had won.<ref name=\"Hoogenboom\">[[Hoogenboom, Ari]]. (1995). ''Rutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President''. Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas.</ref>\n\nA nearly identical scenario played out in South Carolina, where initial returns suggested that Hayes had won the presidential election, while the Democratic candidate had won the gubernatorial contest. As in Louisana, the Republican-controlled returning board rejected several thousand votes, ensuring the election of a Republican Governor and Legislature. The Democratic Party promptly organized a rival state government, under the leadership of [[Wade Hampton III]], who declared Tilden the victor in the presidential election.<ref name=\"Hoogenboom\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, the initial count showed Hayes ahead by 43 votes, but after corrections were made, Tilden took the lead by 94 votes. Subsequently, the returning board rejected numerous ballots, delivering the election to Hayes by nearly a thousand votes. The board also declared that the Republican candidate had won the gubernatorial election; however, the Florida Supreme Court overruled them, instead awarding the victory to Democrat [[George Franklin Drew]], who announced that Tilden had carried Florida.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\">[http://elections.harpweek.com/Controversy.htm \"Hayes v. Tilden: The Electoral College Controversy of 1876\u20131877.\" HarpWeek.]</ref>\n\nFurther complications arose in Oregon: although both sides acknowledged that Hayes had won the state, Tilden's supporters questioned the constitutional eligibility of John W. Watts, as the Hayes elector (The Constitution provides that \"no\u2026person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector.\") Watts was a United States [[postmaster]]; however, he resigned from his office a week after the election, long before the scheduled meeting of the Electoral College. Nevertheless, the state's Democratic Governor, [[LaFayette Grover]], removed Watts as an elector, replacing him with [[C. A. Cronin]] (a Tilden supporter).<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nOn December 6, 1876, the electors met in the state capitals to cast their ballots. In Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, both the Democratic and the Republican slates of electors assembled, and cast conflicting votes, while in Oregon Watts and Cronin both cast ballots. Thus, from each of these four states, two sets of returns were transmitted to Washington.\n\nTilden had won the popular vote by almost a quarter of a million votes, but he did not have a clear Electoral College majority. He received 184 uncontested electoral votes, while Hayes received 165, and both sides claimed the remaining twenty (4 from Florida, 8 from Louisiana, 7 from South Carolina, and one from Oregon). As 185 votes constituted an Electoral College majority, Tilden needed only one of the disputed votes, while Hayes needed all twenty.\n\n==Electoral Commission Act==\nThe election dispute gave rise to a [[constitutional crisis]]. Democrats, who fervently believed that they had been cheated, threatened: \"Tilden or Blood!\" Congressman [[Henry Watterson]] of Kentucky declared that an army of 100,000 men was prepared to march on Washington if Tilden was denied the presidency. Since the Constitution did not explicitly indicate how Electoral College disputes were to be resolved, Congress was forced to consider other methods to settle the crisis. Many Democrats argued that Congress as a whole should determine which certificates to count. However, the chances that this method would result in a harmonious settlement were slim, as the Democrats controlled the House, while the Republicans controlled the Senate. Several Hayes supporters, on the other hand, argued that the President pro tempore of the Senate had the authority to determine which certificates to count, because he was responsible for chairing the congressional session at which the electoral votes were to be tallied. Since the office of President pro tempore was occupied by a Republican, Senator [[Thomas W. Ferry]] of Michigan, this method would have favored Hayes. Still others proposed that the matter should be settled by the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nIn late December, both the House and the Senate each established a special committee charged with developing a mechanism to resolve the issue. The two committees ultimately settled upon creating a commission that would count the electoral votes and resolve questions arising during the count. Many Republicans objected to the idea, insisting that the President pro tempore should resolve the disputes himself. Rutherford Hayes charged that the bill was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Rehnquist\">Rehnquist, William H. (2004). ''Centennial Crisis: The Disputed Election of 1876.'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf.</ref> However, a sufficient number of Republicans joined the Democrats to ensure its passage. On January 25, 1877, the Senate voted in favor of the bill 47-17; the House did likewise the next day, 191-86. The Electoral Commission Act ({{USStat|19|227}}) was signed into law by President Grant on January 29, 1877.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nThe Act provided that the Electoral Commission was to consist of fifteen members: five representatives selected by the House, five senators selected by the Senate, four Supreme Court justices named in the law, and a fifth Supreme Court justice selected by the other four. The most senior justice was to serve as President of the Commission. Whenever two different electoral vote certificates arrived from any state, the Commission was empowered to determine which return was correct. The Commission's decisions could be overturned only by both houses of Congress.<ref name=\"Nagle\">Nagle, John. (2004). \"How Not to Count Votes.\" 104 Columbia Law Review 1732.</ref>\n\n==Membership of the Commission==\nOriginally, it was planned that the Commission would consist of seven [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], seven [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and one independent. Justice [[David Davis (senator)|David Davis]], who was widely regarded as a political independent, was supposed to be the fifteenth justice on the Commission. According to one historian, \"no one, perhaps not even Davis himself, knew which presidential candidate he preferred.\"<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Roy, Jr. (2003). ''Fraud of the Century. Rutherford B. Hayes, Samuel Tilden and the Stolen Election of 1876.'' New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref> Just as the Electoral Commission Bill was passing Congress, the [[Illinois General Assembly|Legislature of Illinois]] elected Davis to the Senate. Democrats in the Illinois Legislature believed that they had purchased Davis' support by voting for him. However, they had made a miscalculation; instead of staying on the Supreme Court so that he could serve on the Commission, he promptly resigned as a Justice in order to take his Senate seat.<ref name=\"HarpWeek\"/>\n\nWith no independents left on the Supreme Court, the final seat on the Electoral Commission was given instead to Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]], a Republican. As a result, the GOP held a one-seat majority on the body. Bradley would, in every case, vote with his fellow Republicans to give the disputed electoral votes to Hayes.<ref name=\"Nagle\"/> The membership of the Commission was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Member (State)!!Body!!colspan=2|Party\n|-\n|{{sort|01|[[Josiah Gardner Abbott]] ([[Massachusetts]])}}||{{sort|01|House}}||style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\"| ||{{sort|01|Democratic}}\n|-\n|{{sort|02|[[Thomas F.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds.

However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal.

His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing.

Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms.

Colors are useful in this series to help distinguish characters, because many are introduced but have relatively minor roles in the progression of the plot.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anime-planet.com/users/clamrwar/reviews/8294|title=The God of High School|date=June 5, 2012|website=Anime-Planet|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Webtoon]]\n* [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]]\n* [[Korean Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=318995 God of High School on Naver (Korean)]\n* [http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/list?title_no=66 God of High School on LINE Webtoon (English)]\n* [http://blog.naver.com/lungdi Park Yong-Jae's Blog]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPevDF7cZU \"Fly to High\" by Younha (The God of High School Game OST)]\n* [http://atkmagazine.com/2015/09/24/god-high-school-strong-nothing-everything/ Review on ATK Magazine's website]\n* Review on [https://realotakugamer.com/the-best-around-the-god-of-highschool-manga-review RealOtakuGamer.com]\n\n{{MAPPA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:God of High School}}\n[[Category:South Korean webtoons]]\n[[Category:2011 webtoon debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s webtoons]]\n[[Category:Crunchyroll Originals]]\n[[Category:MAPPA]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on South Korean webtoons]]\n[[Category:2020 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Upcoming anime television series]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Yeager", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Cleanup.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_High_School"}
