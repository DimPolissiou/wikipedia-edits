In the past, he was a {{nihongo|god of calamity|\u798d\u6d25\u795e|magatsukami}}. He wears a tracksuit and scarf and refers to himself as \"Yato God\" (''Yatogami''). He calls himself a {{nihongo|\"delivery god\"|\u30c7\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9|deribar\u012b goddo}} and often writes his cell number in public areas in case someone needs his help. He usually charges five [[yen]] (about five cents in U.S. currency), which is what Japanese people usually give when praying at a shrine. Yato is gullible and often wastes his money on scams and good-luck charms that allegedly bring happiness. As he \"stopped\" being a god of calamity due to his dislike of violence, he is forgotten by most humans. This results in Yato developing athazagoraphobia (the fear of being forgotten). Hiyori, a human girl, and Yato's current Regalia (weapon), Yukine, are the two closest people to him, and he is protective of both. He shares a fatherly relationship with Yukine, calling Yukine his child at one point, and becomes extremely attached to Hiyori; romantic feelings are hinted at. Yato also shares a close relationship with Kofuku, the God of Poverty, who is there for him when he is in need of help.

He is often seen conversing with Nora and has been known to be able to control Phantoms. He is also known as a god of calamity, similar to Yato, and having worked together with him, and seeing him being what he is now making him wanted to bring back the old Yato. After his defeat at the hands of Yato, it is suggested that Rab\u014d simply wanted Yato (his fellow calamity god) to kill him. He is known to kill humans, Regalia, other gods and Phantoms, not caring what the job is, as long as he was wished to do it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ebisu}}|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]|[[John Burgmeier]]}}\n:One of Seven Gods of Fortune, who offers to buy Yukine from Yato after he becomes a Blessed Vessel, or even use him as a Nora. He dresses like a businessman, and is rather harsh with his words. Unlike most gods, he has no problems with using Nora. Having been abandoned by his mother Izanami, he views himself as an outcast, and thus sympathizes with them. He plans to use Phantoms as Regalia, and his constant failures in that cause him to reincarnate frequently.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|\u014ckuninushi|Daikokuten}}|\u5927\u56fd\u4e3b|\u014ckuninushi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shunsuke Sakuya]]|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:Another of the Seven Gods of Fortune, who also goes by the name of {{Nihongo|\"Daikokuten\"|\u5927\u9ed2\u5929}}. He is a close friend of both Bishamonten and Ebisu. He appears as a big and gruff man with blonde hair who is constantly wearing sunglasses, combined with traditional Japanese clothes. Despite his appearance, however, he is very friendly and fond of rabbits. He is capable of turning into a monstrous spider and is said to be so dangerous even without a Regalia that he was once sealed.\n\n===Regalia===\n:A Regalia is a divine weapon possessed by gods. They are former humans that died for a reason against their will (e.g. not through suicide). Regalia change their shape into a unique weapon when their gods called their Regalia name. Usually, each god has a naming scheme to serve as proof that the god wants a specific type of Regalia, and also as an affirmation of a familial bond. Certain Regalia will evolve after they risk their name to protect their gods into a better shape, which is called a {{nihongo|\"Blessed Vessel\"|\u795d\u306e\u5668|hafuri no utsuwa}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Mayu}}|\u771f\u55a9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Imai]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:She is Yato's former Regalia, and currently one of Tenjin's Regalia. Despite her harsh attitude toward Yato, she does appear to hold a considerable amount of respect and concern for him. An example of this is when she volunteers to be a part of the ablution required to save Yato's life despite the risks involved. When she was still Yato's Regalia, she was given the name {{nihongo|Tomone|\u4f34\u97f3}} and transformed into a small dagger. As Tenjin's Regalia, she transforms into a smoking pipe.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Kazuma}}|\u5146\u9ebb}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|[[Eric Vale]]<ref name=\"eng cast\"/>}}\n:He is one of Bishamonten's Regalia and exemplar. His name as Regalia is {{nihongo|\"Ch\u014dki\"|\u5146\u5668}}, whose shape was originally a nail earring, but because of his close bond with Bishamonten and will to protect her, he became a Blessed Regalia and transformed into a cherry blossom shaped earring who is capable of tracking enemies and also to guide other Regalia in combat.

She is Yato's former Regalia. \"Nora,\" meaning \"stray,\" is how the gods call any Regalia who has many masters and thus many names. Because of this, Nora have bad reputations and are the target of prejudice by the gods, but are nevertheless used for tasks that they do not want their own Regalia to be used. Nora was named {{Nihongo|Hiiro|\u7dcb}} by Yato, her Regalia name being {{nihongo|\"Hiki\"|\u7dcb\u5668}}, and she still offers herself to be used by him, though he always resists. She causes a lot of trouble, going so far as to destroy Yukine's faith in himself. In the anime, she first tries to kill Hiyori with Phantoms and, when that fails, she erases Hiyori's memory of Yukine and Yato. It is noted that, had she been summoned in the ablution ceremony, she would have killed Yukine. In the manga, it is revealed that she had been Yato's Regalia since he was a child and was Yato's childhood companion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Kuraha}}|\u56f7\u5df4}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kazuhiko Inoue]]|[[Greg Dulcie]]}}\n:Kuraha is Bishamonten's Regalia.

Kugaha is Bishamonten's former Regalia. He was Bishamonten's doctor, but betrayed her because he wanted to reincarnate Bishamonten and become her new exemplar. His Regalia form is a balance scale. He is actually a Nora and his name \"Kuga\" was revoked. His name as Bishamonten's Regalia was {{nihongo|\"Rokki\"|\u9678\u5668}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Aiha}}|\u85cd\u5df4}}\n:{{Voiced by|Hisako T\u014dj\u014d|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:Aiha is Bishamonten's Regalia.

Fujisaki had been to and returned from Yomi, taking with him the first Phantom Brush (Koto no Ha). He seems to be connected to a woman with freckles, as Izanami uses this woman's looks during his time in Yomi. However, at some point in time, the woman died and this appears to have become his primary reason for loathing gods and, therefore, the wish that created Yato. This seems to be further proven by the fact that in chapter 61, Nana shows sympathy for Fujisaki, saying he must have had someone he loved who was killed by the heavens because he wouldn't have called them lowly Gods otherwise.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Mutsumi}}|\u7766\u7f8e}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]]}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noragami-anime.net/1/caststaff.html|title=Noragami Staff&Cast|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>\n:A female student who gets bullied by her classmates.

In the past, he was a {{nihongo|god of calamity|\u798d\u6d25\u795e|magatsukami}}. He wears a tracksuit and scarf and refers to himself as \"Yato God\" (''Yatogami''). He calls himself a {{nihongo|\"delivery god\"|\u30c7\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9|deribar\u012b goddo}} and often writes his cell number in public areas in case someone needs his help. He usually charges five [[yen]] (about five cents in U.S. currency), which is what Japanese people usually give when praying at a shrine. Yato is gullible and often wastes his money on scams and good-luck charms that allegedly bring happiness. As he \"stopped\" being a god of calamity due to his dislike of violence, he is forgotten by most humans. This results in Yato developing athazagoraphobia (the fear of being forgotten). Hiyori, a human girl, and Yato's current Regalia (weapon), Yukine, are the two closest people to him, and he is protective of both. He shares a fatherly relationship with Yukine, calling Yukine his child at one point, and becomes extremely attached to Hiyori; romantic feelings are hinted at. Yato also shares a close relationship with Kofuku, the God of Poverty, who is there for him when he is in need of help.

He is often seen conversing with Nora and has been known to be able to control Phantoms. He is also known as a god of calamity, similar to Yato, and having worked together with him, and seeing him being what he is now making him wanted to bring back the old Yato. After his defeat at the hands of Yato, it is suggested that Rab\u014d simply wanted Yato (his fellow calamity god) to kill him. He is known to kill humans, Regalia, other gods and Phantoms, not caring what the job is, as long as he was wished to do it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ebisu}}|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]|[[John Burgmeier]]}}\n:One of Seven Gods of Fortune, who offers to buy Yukine from Yato after he becomes a Blessed Vessel, or even use him as a Nora. He dresses like a businessman, and is rather harsh with his words. Unlike most gods, he has no problems with using Nora. Having been abandoned by his mother Izanami, he views himself as an outcast, and thus sympathizes with them. He plans to use Phantoms as Regalia, and his constant failures in that cause him to reincarnate frequently.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|\u014ckuninushi|Daikokuten}}|\u5927\u56fd\u4e3b|\u014ckuninushi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shunsuke Sakuya]]|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:Another of the Seven Gods of Fortune, who also goes by the name of {{Nihongo|\"Daikokuten\"|\u5927\u9ed2\u5929}}. He is a close friend of both Bishamonten and Ebisu. He appears as a big and gruff man with blonde hair who is constantly wearing sunglasses, combined with traditional Japanese clothes. Despite his appearance, however, he is very friendly and fond of rabbits. He is capable of turning into a monstrous spider and is said to be so dangerous even without a Regalia that he was once sealed.\n\n===Regalia===\n:A Regalia is a divine weapon possessed by gods. They are former humans that died for a reason against their will (e.g. not through suicide). Regalia change their shape into a unique weapon when their gods called their Regalia name. Usually, each god has a naming scheme to serve as proof that the god wants a specific type of Regalia, and also as an affirmation of a familial bond. Certain Regalia will evolve after they risk their name to protect their gods into a better shape, which is called a {{nihongo|\"Blessed Vessel\"|\u795d\u306e\u5668|hafuri no utsuwa}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Mayu}}|\u771f\u55a9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Imai]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:She is Yato's former Regalia, and currently one of Tenjin's Regalia. Despite her harsh attitude toward Yato, she does appear to hold a considerable amount of respect and concern for him. An example of this is when she volunteers to be a part of the ablution required to save Yato's life despite the risks involved. When she was still Yato's Regalia, she was given the name {{nihongo|Tomone|\u4f34\u97f3}} and transformed into a small dagger.

She is Yato's former Regalia. \"Nora,\" meaning \"stray,\" is how the gods call any Regalia who has many masters and thus many names. Because of this, Nora have bad reputations and are the target of prejudice by the gods, but are nevertheless used for tasks that they do not want their own Regalia to be used. Nora was named {{Nihongo|Hiiro|\u7dcb}} by Yato, her Regalia name being {{nihongo|\"Hiki\"|\u7dcb\u5668}}, and she still offers herself to be used by him, though he always resists. She causes a lot of trouble, going so far as to destroy Yukine's faith in himself. In the anime, she first tries to kill Hiyori with Phantoms and, when that fails, she erases Hiyori's memory of Yukine and Yato.

Fujisaki had been to and returned from Yomi, taking with him the first Phantom Brush (Koto no Ha). He seems to be connected to a woman with freckles, as Izanami uses this woman's looks during his time in Yomi. However, at some point in time, the woman died and this appears to have become his primary reason for loathing gods and, therefore, the wish that created Yato. This seems to be further proven by the fact that in chapter 61, Nana shows sympathy for Fujisaki, saying he must have had someone he loved who was killed by the heavens because he wouldn't have called them lowly Gods otherwise.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Mutsumi}}|\u7766\u7f8e}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]]}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noragami-anime.net/1/caststaff.html|title=Noragami Staff&Cast|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>\n:A female student who gets bullied by her classmates.
