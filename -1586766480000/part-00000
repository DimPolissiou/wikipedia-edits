Beyond Skarloey the line continues to the [[Fictional locations in The Railway Series#Skarloey_Slate_Mines|Skarloey]] [[slate]] [[quarry]].<ref name=SodorMaps>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211115812/http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/mapsection.htm|title=Maps of Sodor|accessdate=11 December 2004}}</ref> Its is run by the Thin Controller, and its chief engineer is Ivo Hugh. The line was inspired by the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in Wales, where Rev. W. Awdry worked as a volunteer guard in the 1950s. The Talyllyn railway was owned by [[Henry Haydn Jones|Sir Haydn Jones]] (the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Merioneth]] \u2013 the county which the Talyllyn Railway is in), who inspired the character of Sir Handel Brown in the books.\n\n==(Fictional) History==\nThe [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W Awdry]] based his stories on real incidents on the real railways. In order to ensure consistency and accuracy, Awdry developed a 'history' for the Island of Sodor and its railways, which was published to accompany the series.  The history was set in context, and dates were determined to be consistent with the real world.\n\nIn the case of the Skarloey Railway, its history closely parallels that of the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in Wales. According to the \"research\" by the Rev. Awdry, the line began as a [[plateway]] and was opened in 1806 to collect [[copper ore]] and later [[slate]] from the local [[quarry|quarries]]. It was worked by gravity and carried mineral traffic that was shipped from Balladswail. Following the [[Ffestiniog Railway|Ffestiniog Railway's]] lead in 1863, James Spooner was engaged in surveying a line for steam locomotives. It was also planned to develop passenger traffic for tourists to the Springs at Skarloey where there would be hotels and guest houses.\n\nIt was later realized that the line could carry visitors to the local landmarks of Skarloey (which means 'Lake in the Woods') and Rheneas ('Divided Waterfall'). Like all railways at this time, it was powered by [[horse]]s, but by 1865 the railway's owners decided they needed [[locomotive|steam engines]] to help out. They ordered two engines from the locomotive builders [[Fletcher Jennings Ltd]] in Whitehaven, England. These engines were [[Skarloey]] and [[Rheneas]].\n\nSkarloey and Rheneas worked hard for many years, but eventually, the demand for slate decreased due to cheaper slate being imported from Italy. After [[World War II]] the railway was in a poor state, and the old mines had become ammunition dumps. The owner, Sir Handel Brown, thought he would have to sell the railway. At this point, the railway was taken over by Mr. Peter Sam, who became the [[Thin Controller]]. With the help of Mr. Ivo Hugh and a number of volunteers, they managed to keep the railway going. The railway's main source of income was now tourist traffic.\n\nEventually, Skarloey failed and Rheneas was left to manage alone, which he did admirably until [[Peter Sam]] and [[Sir Handel]] were bought from the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] to help out. Later they purchased [[Rusty the Diesel|Rusty]] and [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duncan|Duncan]].\n\nIt was around this time that the slate quarries were reopened. The [[slate]] from these quarries was pure and free from metallic impurities, which meant it was in demand as other slate demand fell.\n\nIn 1965 (the year that ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'' was published) the railway celebrated the [[century|100th birthday]] of Skarloey and Rheneas with the opening of a new [[branch line]] to Lakeside by the Duke of Sodor. A second triumph came in 1969 when [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]] was saved and brought to the railway, where he was repaired and now works the passenger trains.\n\nSince the centenary celebrations of 1965, the railway has purchased a new diesel, ''[[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Fred|Fred]]''. It has also built a new steam engine, ''[[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Ivo Hugh|Ivo Hugh]]'', who was built in ''[[List of Railway Series books#New_Little_Engine|New Little Engine]]''.<ref name=NewLittleEngine/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Locomotives===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Crovan's Gate Ensemble 1995.jpg|thumb|The ensemble at Crovan's Gate: On the front are Duncan, Skarloey, Sir Handel and Peter Sam.

The steam locomotive livery features lots of polished brass-work and is largely unchanged since the opening of the railway (judging by the illustrations in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', although these show a more elaborate blue and yellow lining scheme).\n\nIn the [[Thomas & Friends]] [[TV series]], all of the engines, apart from [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]], are painted in completely different colours. This was presumably to assist the show's young fans in identifying the different engines. In the TV series, [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Skarloey|Skarloey]] is painted bright red (as in the books) with white and yellow lining (blue in the books); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Rheneas|Rheneas]] was painted vermillion; [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Sir Handel|Sir Handel]] and [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Peter Sam|Peter Sam]] retained the colors that they wore when they were named Falcon and Stuart, on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] (blue and green respectively); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Rusty|Rusty]] was painted rust-orange (which was the reason for his naming, according to a Thomas the Tank Engine annual); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Duncan|Duncan]] was painted yellow with gold and black lining; and [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]] kept his [[Mid- Railway Series dark red-brown..\n\n===Carriages===\nAgnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima and Beatrice are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 1\u20135. The brake van Cora is based on the [[Corris Railway]] brake van that now runs on the Talyllyn.\nOpen coaches Ada, Jane and Mabel were rebuilt to a more conventional outline when funds became available and are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 11, 12, 13. Gertrude and Millicent, bogie coaches, are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 9 & 10. There are also longer coaches which are supposedly Talyllyn Railway carriages 16 and 18\u201323.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Skarloey carriage\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|''Agnes''\n|First class coach, is something of a snob.\n|-\n|2\n|''Ruth''\n|Third class coach.\n|-\n|3\n|''Lucy''\n|Third class coach\n|-\n|4\n|''Jemima''\n|Third class coach.

The enclosed carriages are painted off-white (upper half) and blue (lower).\n\n===Human Characters===\nThere have been a number of people associated with the railway who have appeared in the stories and TV Series.\n\n====Thin Controller====\nKnown properly as Mr. Peter Sam, the '''Thin Controller''' is the manager of the Skarloey Railway. A year before the arrival of Sir Handel and Peter Sam, he had to serve as [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard|guard]] for all the trains.\n\nThe Thin Controller was introduced in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', the tenth volume of [[the Railway Series]] and has now been introduced into the ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' TV series as [[Mr. Percival]], the narrow-gauge controller. He is based upon Edward Thomas general manager of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nAccording to ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Sodor: Reading Between the Lines|Sodor: Reading Between the Lines]]'', there are two thin controllers.\n\n*Mr. Peter Sam - The Thin Controller I\n*Mr. Roger Sam - The Thin Controller II\n\n====Sir Handel Brown====\nFormer owner of the railway, there have been two Sir Handel Browns:\n*Sir Handel Brown I\n*Sir Handel Brown II\n\n====Ivo Hugh====\n'''Ivo Hugh''' was one half of the two-man train crew in the final days of two-engine operation, alongside The Thin Controller. He was also the line's Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) and became ''Rusty's'' driver, upon the diesel locomotive's arrival.\n\nHugh had retired by the time of ''[[List of Railway Series Books#New Little Engine|New Little Engine]]'' and had the honour of having the railway's new No. 7 named after him.\n\nHis son succeeded him as the new CME.\n\n====Other characters====\n*'''Mrs. Last''' &ndash; first appears in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]''. She is a passenger who arrives late for her train. (She has not appeared in the TV series.)\n*'''The Refreshment Lady''' &ndash; Although she never receives a name in the stories, she is very popular with the passengers, selling drinks and ices on hot days. She was once left behind by Peter Sam by mistake, an incident inspired by [[Wilbert Vere Awdry|Reverend Awdry's]] own experience working as a guard on the Talyllyn Railway - albeit on that occasion, he admitted that the mistake was his fault rather than that of the engine!\n*'''Nancy the Guard's Daughter''' &ndash; A young girl who used to polish the engines. She was a friend to the engines, and Skarloey told her the story of his early life in the book ''Very Old Engines''. She is now grown up, and lives with her husband on the [[Isle of Man]].\n*'''Mr. Mack''' &ndash; former controller of the railway.\n*'''Mr. Bobbie''' &ndash; An engineer from [[Fletcher Jennings Ltd|Fletcher Jennings & Company]], who had worked on the construction of Skarloey. He was brought over when Skarloey misbehaved on his first arrival.\n*'''The Duke of Sodor''' &ndash; A British peer, and, jointly with the British monarch, the island's hereditary \"monarch\". He succeeded as a minor after his father was killed in the Second World War, and, as a young man in his twenties, appears only in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', where he formally opens the loop line extension around the lake in 1965. He was introduced into the TV series with his correct original title of Earl of Sodor; he is only called \"Duke\" by some of the people of Sodor.\n*'''Lizzie and Kathy''' &ndash; These girls worked on the Skarloey Railway during the 1990s, again polishing the engines. Their parents worked on the Talyllyn Railway and came to the [[Island of Sodor]] on holiday.\n*'''Mr. Percival''' &ndash; The Thin Controller as portrayed in the ''[[Thomas and Friends]]'' TV series. He first appeared in Season 9.\n*'''Mrs. Percival''' &ndash; Mr. Percival's wife who first appears in season 10.\n*'''Percival Twins''' &ndash; Mr. and Mrs. Percival's children who appear in season 12.\n\n== Stations ==\n{{Skarloey Railway RDT}}\n=== In The Railway Series (in the books) ===\nThe names of the stations are not actually ever mentioned in the books (with the exception of one halt, Quarry Siding), and were referred to as \"the station by the lake\", \"the main station\", \"the first station\", \"the middle station\", \"the station by the waterfalls\", \"the top station\", etc.; thus, all their names are derived from [[List of Railway Series books#Companion_volumes|complementary publications about Sodor]], such as ''[[List of Railway Series Books#The Thomas the Tank Engine Man|The Thomas the Tank Engine Man]]''.<ref name=FourLittleEngines/><ref name=LittleOldEngine/><ref name=GallantOldEngine/><ref name=VeryOldEngines/><ref name=GreatLittleEngines/><ref name=NewLittleEngine/><ref name=DukeTheLostEngine/><ref name=MountainEngines/><ref name=ThomasTankMan>{{Cite book|title=[[List of Railway Series Books#The Thomas the Tank Engine Man|The Thomas the Tank Engine Man]]|last=Sibley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Sibley}}</ref>\n\nThe railway runs from Crovan's Gate, to Cros-ny-Cuirn, then stopping at Glennock, calling at Rheneas before starting the Lakeside loop line, which stops at Lakeside and finally the line ended at Skarloey.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nAnother line branches off near Lakeside and goes to Ulfstead Castle.\n\nA further halt, called 'Quarry Siding' is mentioned in ''[[List of Railway Series books#The Little Old Engine|The Little Old Engine]]''. This halt is based on [[Quarry Siding Halt railway station|Quarry Siding halt]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=LittleOldEngine/>\n\n==== Crovan's Gate ====\nThis is the main station and southern terminus of the railway. The station complex is a compilation of all the stations at [[Tywyn]], which is the primary location and western terminus of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nThe passenger station at Crovan's Gate has a very typical layout for an interchange station. It has no specific real-life base, but could have been inspired by a proposed interchange station at [[Tywyn railway station|Tywyn mainline station]], which was the planned passenger terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, however the railway between [[Tywyn Wharf railway station|Tywyn Wharf Station]] and the mainline station was never built \u2014 for unknown reasons.\n\nThe workshops, locomotive sheds, and carriage shed, at Crovan's Gate, portrayed in all of the books involving the Skarloey Railway, are based on the workshops, locomotive sheds, and original carriage shed, at {{stnlnk|Tywyn Pendre}} on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"VeryOldEngines\"/><ref name=\"GreatLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"NewLittleEngine\"/><ref name=\"DukeTheLostEngine\"/><ref name=\"MountainEngines\"/>\n\nThe wharf at Crovans Gate, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#The_Little_Old_Engine|The Little Old Engine]]'' and ''[[List of Railway Series books#Gallant_Old_Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]'', is based on the slate wharf at {{stnlnk|Tywyn Wharf}} on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].<ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/>\n\n==== Cros-ny-Curin ====\nCros-ny-Curin Station is a minor station about 3 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/> It is situated at the point where the Skarloey Railway's current route starts deviating from the route of the 1806 horse-drawn plateway,<ref name=SodorMaps/> and is were the first incline was on the plateway.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\nThe station, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four_Little_Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Rhyd-yr-onen railway station|Rhyd-yr-onen station]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\nCros-ny-Curin's (fictional) etymology is that it was derived from 'Crossag-ny-cuirn', which means 'Little-Crossing-of-the-Mountain-Ash' in [[Sudric]] (Sodor's fictional language). This is a reflection of the meaning of 'Rhyd-yr-onnen' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which is 'Ash-ford'.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\n==== Glennock ====\nGlennock Station, often called 'the middle station', is a station approximately 11 miles from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe station's name is (fictionally) derived from 'Gleigh-knock', which means 'Blue-hill' in Sudric. This is the same as the Welsh meaning of [[Brynglas railway station|Bryn-Glas station]] on the Talyllyn Railway, which the station was partly based on.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\nGlennock station's positioning is based on Brynglas station on the Talyllyn Railway,<ref name=SodorMaps/><ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/> but the station itself, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Aberllefenni railway station|Aberllefenni station]] on the [[Corris Railway]].<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\n==== Rheneas ====\nRheneas, often called 'The station by the waterfalls', is a station built for tourists traffic to the nearby waterfalls. It is approximately 21 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nRheneas station, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Gallant Old Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]'', is based on [[Dolgoch railway station|Dolgoch station]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/> 'Rheneas' means 'Divided Waterfall' in Sudric, and the station is so-named because of the nearby waterfalls, which themselves are based on the waterfalls near Dolgoch station on the Talyllyn Railway.\n\n==== Lakeside ====\nLakeside station is a station which is halfway round the ''Lakeside Loop''. It is approximately 23 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe station, and the associated ''Lakeside Loop Line'' which the station is on, was opened in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', by the [[Duke of Sodor]]<ref name=\"VeryOldEngines\"/>\n\n==== Skarloey ====\nSkarloey station is the northern passenger terminus of the Skarloey Railway, although the railway continues to quarries further west. The station was built for tourists for the lake, and is approximately 22 miles from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe location of Skarloey station is based on a proposed station serving the hamlet of Dolffanog, a small hamlet north-east of [[Tal-y-llyn lake|Talyllyn lake]],<ref name=SodorMaps/> which featured in various 1970s proposals for an extension of the Talyllyn Railway to [[Tal-y-llyn Lake|Talyllyn lake]], [[Corris]], and [[Machynlleth]]. However, most of the station layout itself, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Abergynolwyn railway station]], the eastern terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, in its pre-1976 layout.<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\nSkarloey's (fictional) eytymology is that the word came from 'Scacaloey', which itself was a corruption of 'Skogarloey', which means 'Lake-in-the-Woods' in Sudric. This is based on the meaning of 'Talyllyn' (Head-of-the-lake) in Welsh.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\n=== In Thomas And Friends (in the television series) ===\nThe railway in the television series also calls at Middle, Elephant Park, Tea Room, Bluebell Valley, Mountain Village, and Rumblin Bridge.\n\nIn the television series the railway runs from The Wharf, to west to Crovan's Gate, then north south of Rheneas where a line branches off and goes to Vicarstown, The main line continues the same path it does in the Railway Series.\n\n==Appearences==\nThe Skarloey Railway first appeared in [[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]], the 10<sup>th</sup> book in [[The Railway Series]], in  October 1955. It has also featured in every season of the [[Thomas and Friends]] [[TV Show]] since [[Thomas & Friends (series 4)|season 4]]\n\n=== In The Railway Series (in the books) ===\nThe railway appeared in six books in [[The Railway Series]] \u2013 four in which it was the primary railway, and two in which it was not the primary focus, but played a significant supporting role.<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"VeryOldEngines\"/><ref name=\"GreatLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"NewLittleEngine\"/><ref name=\"DukeTheLostEngine\"/><ref name=\"MountainEngines\"/>\n\n====Books where the Skarloey Railway is the primary focus====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Book No.\n!Book Name\n!Author\n|-\n|''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four_Little_Engines|10]]''<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n|''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four_Little_Engines|Four Little Engines]]''<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n|[[Wilbert Awdry|The Reverend Wilbert Awdry]]<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n|-\n|''[[List of Railway Series Books#The_Little_Old_Engine|14]]''<ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/>\n|''[[List of Railway Series Books#The_Little_Old_Engine|The Little Old Engine]]''<ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/>\n|[[Wilbert Awdry|The Rev.

W. Awdry]]<ref name=\"DukeTheLostEngine\"/>\n|}\n\n===In Thomas & Friends (on television)===\nThe railway first appeared in [[Thomas and Friends - Season 4|the fourth season]] of [[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]. At this time it closely followed the layout as portrayed in [[The Railway Series]] books, but from [[Thomas and Friends - Season 5|Season 5]] it differed significantly, deviating further from the books at the same time as the route of the [[North Western Railway (fictional)|North Western Railway]] was significantly altered.\n\nIt appears to be part of the North Western Railway rather than an independent line. It was run by [[the Fat Controller]], but from the ninth season onwards was under the control of \"Mr Percival\", a man strongly resembling the Thin Controller (as he is often referred to in the British version. Similarly, the American version occasionally refers to him as the Narrow Gauge Controller). Mr Hugh does not appear at all.\n\nThe railway has many more carriages in this version. Ada, Jane, Mabel, Gertrude and Millicent are entirely absent. Coaches resembling Agnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima, Beatrice and Cora do appear along with red coaches and coaches which are green upper half and cream lower half, but are unnamed and rarely speak. Ivo Hugh (the engine) has not appeared either, as the book in which he appeared (''New Little Engine'') has not been televised. However, the line has four new engines in this version named Bertram, Mighty Mac, \"Fearless\" Freddie, who acquired the number of Ivo Hugh, and Luke. Proteus was another engine originated from the TV series. He was never seen with the other engines, but Peter Sam once tried to find him and his magic lamp. He never succeeded. Years later, Peter Sam discovered a statue of Proteus that was put on display at the Showgrounds.\n\nThe Owner also does not appear.\n\n====Television episodes featuring the Skarloey Railway engines====\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 4|Season 4]]\n**Granpuff\n**Sleeping Beauty\n**Bulldog\n**You Can't Win!\n**Four Little Engines \n**A Bad Day for Sir Handel\n**Peter Sam and the Refreshment Lady\n**Trucks/Rusty Helps Peter Sam\n**Home At Last\n**Rock 'n' Roll\n**Special Funnel\n**Steam Roller\n**Passengers and Polish\n**Gallant Old Engine\n**Rusty to the Rescue\n**Thomas and Stepney\n**Bowled Out\n**Fish (''stock footage'')\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 5|Season 5]]\n**Bye George!\n**Stepney Gets Lost\n**Toby and the Flood (''stock footage'')\n**Toby's Discovery\n**Make Someone Happy (''stock footage'')\n**Duncan Gets Spooked\n**Rusty and the Boulder\n**Snow\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 6|Season 6]]\n**Dunkin' Duncan\n**Rusty Saves the Day\n**Faulty Whistles\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 7|Season 7]]\n**James and the Queen of Sodor (''stock footage'')\n**Bulgy Rides Again (''stock footage'')\n**The Old Bridge\n**Edward's Brass Band (''deleted scene stock footage'')\n**Rheneas and the Roller Coaster\n**Trusty Rusty\n**The Refreshment Lady's Tea Shop/The Refreshment Lady's Stand\n**Harold and the Flying Horse\n**The Grand Opening\n**The Runaway Elephant\n**Not So Hasty Puddings/Not So Hasty Cakes\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 9|Season 9]]\n**Mighty Mac\n**Tuneful Toots\n**Rheneas and the Dinosaur\n**The Magic Lamp\n**Duncan and the Old Mine\n**Skarloey the Brave\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 10|Season 10]]\n**Follow that Flour\n**A Smooth Ride\n**Duncan Drops a Clanger\n**Fearless Freddie\n**Which Way Now?\n**Wharf and Peace\n**Duncan's Bluff\n**Missing Trucks/Missing Cars\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 11|Season 11]]\n**Duncan Does it All\n**Sir Handel in Charge\n**Cool Truckings\n**Ding-a-Ling\n**Skarloey Storms Through\n**Wash Behind Your Buffers\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 12|Season 12]]\n**Mountain Marvel\n**The Party Surprise\n**Duncan and the Hot Air Balloon\n**Push Me, Pull You\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 16)|Season 16]]\n**Don't Bother Victor!\n**The Christmas Tree Express\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 17)|Season 17]]\n**Luke's New Friend\n**The Switch\n**Gone Fishing\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 18)|Season 18]]\n**Disappearing Diesels\n**Duncan and the Grumpy Passenger\n**Long Lost Friend\n**Duncan the Humbug\n**Emily Saves the World\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 20)|Season 20]]\n**Henry Gets the Express\n**Bradford the Brake Van\n**Saving Time\n**The Missing Breakdown Train\n**Engine of the Future\n**Tit for Tat\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 21)|Season 21]]\n**Runaway Engine\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 22)|Season 22]]\n**Tiger Trouble (''stock footage'')\n**Thomas' Animal Ark (''stock footage'')\n**The Case of the Puzzling Parts\n**Counting on Nia\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 23)|Season 23]]\n**Chucklesome Trucks (''stock footage'')\n**Diesel Do Right\n**Steam Team to the Rescue\n**Diesel Glows Away\n*Specials\n**Calling All Engines!

Beyond Skarloey the line continues to the [[Fictional locations in The Railway Series#Skarloey_Slate_Mines|Skarloey]] [[slate]] [[quarry]].<ref name=SodorMaps>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211115812/http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/mapsection.htm|title=Maps of Sodor|accessdate=11 December 2004}}</ref> Its is run by the Thin Controller, and its chief engineer is Ivo Hugh. The line was inspired by the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in Wales, where Rev. W. Awdry worked as a volunteer guard in the 1950s. The Talyllyn railway was owned by [[Henry Haydn Jones|Sir Haydn Jones]] (the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Merioneth]] \u2013 the county which the Talyllyn Railway is in), who inspired the character of Sir Handel Brown in the books.\n\n==(Fictional) History==\nThe [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W Awdry]] based his stories on real incidents on the real railways. In order to ensure consistency and accuracy, Awdry developed a 'history' for the Island of Sodor and its railways, which was published to accompany the series.  The history was set in context, and dates were determined to be consistent with the real world.\n\nIn the case of the Skarloey Railway, its history closely parallels that of the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in Wales. According to the \"research\" by the Rev. Awdry, the line began as a [[plateway]] and was opened in 1806 to collect [[copper ore]] and later [[slate]] from the local [[quarry|quarries]]. It was worked by gravity and carried mineral traffic that was shipped from Balladswail. Following the [[Ffestiniog Railway|Ffestiniog Railway's]] lead in 1863, James Spooner was engaged in surveying a line for steam locomotives. It was also planned to develop passenger traffic for tourists to the Springs at Skarloey where there would be hotels and guest houses.\n\nIt was later realized that the line could carry visitors to the local landmarks of Skarloey (which means 'Lake in the Woods') and Rheneas ('Divided Waterfall'). Like all railways at this time, it was powered by [[horse]]s, but by 1865 the railway's owners decided they needed [[locomotive|steam engines]] to help out. They ordered two engines from the locomotive builders [[Fletcher Jennings Ltd]] in Whitehaven, England. These engines were [[Skarloey]] and [[Rheneas]].\n\nSkarloey and Rheneas worked hard for many years, but eventually, the demand for slate decreased due to cheaper slate being imported from Italy. After [[World War II]] the railway was in a poor state, and the old mines had become ammunition dumps. The owner, Sir Handel Brown, thought he would have to sell the railway. At this point, the railway was taken over by Mr. Peter Sam, who became the [[Thin Controller]]. With the help of Mr. Ivo Hugh and a number of volunteers, they managed to keep the railway going. The railway's main source of income was now tourist traffic.\n\nEventually, Skarloey failed and Rheneas was left to manage alone, which he did admirably until [[Peter Sam]] and [[Sir Handel]] were bought from the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] to help out. Later they purchased [[Rusty the Diesel|Rusty]] and [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duncan|Duncan]].\n\nIt was around this time that the slate quarries were reopened. The [[slate]] from these quarries was pure and free from metallic impurities, which meant it was in demand as other slate demand fell.\n\nIn 1965 (the year that ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'' was published) the railway celebrated the [[century|100th birthday]] of Skarloey and Rheneas with the opening of a new [[branch line]] to Lakeside by the Duke of Sodor. A second triumph came in 1969 when [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]] was saved and brought to the railway, where he was repaired and now works the passenger trains.\n\nSince the centenary celebrations of 1965, the railway has purchased a new diesel, ''[[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Fred|Fred]]''. It has also built a new steam engine, ''[[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Ivo Hugh|Ivo Hugh]]'', who was built in ''[[List of Railway Series books#New_Little_Engine|New Little Engine]]''.<ref name=NewLittleEngine/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Locomotives===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Crovan's Gate Ensemble 1995.jpg|thumb|The ensemble at Crovan's Gate: On the front are Duncan, Skarloey, Sir Handel and Peter Sam.

Unusually, the engines did not have nameplates; their names were just painted directly in gold on the side of the saddle tank or boiler, as to had been the case on the [[Talyllyn Railway]] before the [[Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society]] took over. The other diesels are painted dark-grey. The steam locomotive livery features lots of polished brass-work and is largely unchanged since the opening of the railway (judging by the illustrations in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', although these show a more elaborate blue and yellow lining scheme).\n\nIn the [[Thomas & Friends]] [[TV series]], all of the engines, apart from [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]], are painted in completely different colours. This was presumably to assist the show's young fans in identifying the different engines. In the TV series, [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Skarloey|Skarloey]] is painted bright red (as in the books) with white and yellow lining (blue in the books); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Rheneas|Rheneas]] was painted vermillion; [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Sir Handel|Sir Handel]] and [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Peter Sam|Peter Sam]] retained the colors that they wore when they were named Falcon and Stuart, on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] (blue and green respectively); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Rusty|Rusty]] was painted rust-orange (which was the reason for his naming, according to a Thomas the Tank Engine annual); [[Railway engines (Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends)#Duncan|Duncan]] was painted yellow with gold and black lining; and [[List of Thomas & Friends narrow-gauge engines#Duke|Duke]] kept his [[Mid- Railway Series dark red-brown..\n\n===Carriages===\nAgnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima and Beatrice are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 1\u20135. The brake van Cora is based on the [[Corris Railway]] brake van that now runs on the Talyllyn.\nOpen coaches Ada, Jane and Mabel were rebuilt to a more conventional outline when funds became available and are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 11, 12, 13. Gertrude and Millicent, bogie coaches, are based on Talyllyn Railway carriages 9 & 10.

The enclosed carriages are painted off-white (upper half) and blue (lower).\n\n===Human Characters===\nThere have been a number of people associated with the railway who have appeared in the stories and TV Series.\n\n====Thin Controller====\nKnown properly as Mr. Peter Sam, the '''Thin Controller''' is the manager of the Skarloey Railway. A year before the arrival of Sir Handel and Peter Sam, he had to serve as [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard|guard]] for all the trains.\n\nThe Thin Controller was introduced in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', the tenth volume of [[the Railway Series]] and has now been introduced into the ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' TV series as [[Mr. Percival]], the narrow-gauge controller. He is based upon Edward Thomas general manager of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nAccording to ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Sodor: Reading Between the Lines|Sodor: Reading Between the Lines]]'', there are two thin controllers.\n\n*Mr. Peter Sam - The Thin Controller I\n*Mr. Roger Sam - The Thin Controller II\n\n====Sir Handel Brown====\nFormer owner of the railway, there have been two Sir Handel Browns:\n*Sir Handel Brown I\n*Sir Handel Brown II\n\n====Ivo Hugh====\n'''Ivo Hugh''' was one half of the two-man train crew in the final days of two-engine operation, alongside The Thin Controller. He was also the line's Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) and became ''Rusty's'' driver, upon the diesel locomotive's arrival.\n\nHugh had retired by the time of ''[[List of Railway Series Books#New Little Engine|New Little Engine]]'' and had the honour of having the railway's new No. 7 named after him.\n\nHis son succeeded him as the new CME.\n\n====Other characters====\n*'''Mrs. Last''' &ndash; first appears in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]''. She is a passenger who arrives late for her train. (She has not appeared in the TV series.)\n*'''The Refreshment Lady''' &ndash; Although she never receives a name in the stories, she is very popular with the passengers, selling drinks and ices on hot days. She was once left behind by Peter Sam by mistake, an incident inspired by [[Wilbert Vere Awdry|Reverend Awdry's]] own experience working as a guard on the Talyllyn Railway - albeit on that occasion, he admitted that the mistake was his fault rather than that of the engine!\n*'''Nancy the Guard's Daughter''' &ndash; A young girl who used to polish the engines. She was a friend to the engines, and Skarloey told her the story of his early life in the book ''Very Old Engines''. She is now grown up, and lives with her husband on the [[Isle of Man]].\n*'''Mr. Mack''' &ndash; former controller of the railway.\n*'''Mr. Bobbie''' &ndash; An engineer from [[Fletcher Jennings Ltd|Fletcher Jennings & Company]], who had worked on the construction of Skarloey. He was brought over when Skarloey misbehaved on his first arrival.\n*'''The Duke of Sodor''' &ndash; A British peer, and, jointly with the British monarch, the island's hereditary \"monarch\". He succeeded as a minor after his father was killed in the Second World War, and, as a young man in his twenties, appears only in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', where he formally opens the loop line extension around the lake in 1965. He was introduced into the TV series with his correct original title of Earl of Sodor; he is only called \"Duke\" by some of the people of Sodor.\n*'''Lizzie and Kathy''' &ndash; These girls worked on the Skarloey Railway during the 1990s, again polishing the engines. Their parents worked on the Talyllyn Railway and came to the [[Island of Sodor]] on holiday.\n*'''Mr. Percival''' &ndash; The Thin Controller as portrayed in the ''[[Thomas and Friends]]'' TV series. He first appeared in Season 9.\n*'''Mrs. Percival''' &ndash; Mr. Percival's wife who first appears in season 10.\n*'''Percival Twins''' &ndash; Mr. and Mrs. Percival's children who appear in season 12.\n\n== Stations ==\n{{Skarloey Railway RDT}}\n=== In The Railway Series (in the books) ===\nThe names of the stations are not actually ever mentioned in the books (with the exception of one halt, Quarry Siding), and were referred to as \"the station by the lake\", \"the main station\", \"the first station\", \"the middle station\", \"the station by the waterfalls\", \"the top station\", etc.; thus, all their names are derived from [[List of Railway Series books#Companion_volumes|complementary publications about Sodor]], such as ''[[List of Railway Series Books#The Thomas the Tank Engine Man|The Thomas the Tank Engine Man]]''.<ref name=FourLittleEngines/><ref name=LittleOldEngine/><ref name=GallantOldEngine/><ref name=VeryOldEngines/><ref name=GreatLittleEngines/><ref name=NewLittleEngine/><ref name=DukeTheLostEngine/><ref name=MountainEngines/><ref name=ThomasTankMan>{{Cite book|title=[[List of Railway Series Books#The Thomas the Tank Engine Man|The Thomas the Tank Engine Man]]|last=Sibley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Sibley}}</ref>\n\nThe railway runs from Crovan's Gate, to Cros-ny-Cuirn, then stopping at Glennock, calling at Rheneas before starting the Lakeside loop line, which stops at Lakeside and finally the line ended at Skarloey.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nAnother line branches off near Lakeside and goes to Ulfstead Castle.\n\nA further halt, called 'Quarry Siding' is mentioned in ''[[List of Railway Series books#The Little Old Engine|The Little Old Engine]]''. This halt is based on [[Quarry Siding Halt railway station|Quarry Siding halt]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=LittleOldEngine/>\n\n==== Crovan's Gate ====\nThis is the main station and southern terminus of the railway. The station complex is a compilation of all the stations at [[Tywyn]], which is the primary location and western terminus of the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\nThe passenger station at Crovan's Gate has a very typical layout for an interchange station. It has no specific real-life base, but could have been inspired by a proposed interchange station at [[Tywyn railway station|Tywyn mainline station]], which was the planned passenger terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, however the railway between [[Tywyn Wharf railway station|Tywyn Wharf Station]] and the mainline station was never built \u2014 for unknown reasons.\n\nThe workshops, locomotive sheds, and carriage shed, at Crovan's Gate, portrayed in all of the books involving the Skarloey Railway, are based on the workshops, locomotive sheds, and original carriage shed, at {{stnlnk|Tywyn Pendre}} on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"VeryOldEngines\"/><ref name=\"GreatLittleEngines\"/><ref name=\"NewLittleEngine\"/><ref name=\"DukeTheLostEngine\"/><ref name=\"MountainEngines\"/>\n\nThe wharf at Crovans Gate, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#The_Little_Old_Engine|The Little Old Engine]]'' and ''[[List of Railway Series books#Gallant_Old_Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]'', is based on the slate wharf at {{stnlnk|Tywyn Wharf}} on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].<ref name=\"LittleOldEngine\"/><ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/>\n\n==== Cros-ny-Curin ====\nCros-ny-Curin Station is a minor station about 3 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/> It is situated at the point where the Skarloey Railway's current route starts deviating from the route of the 1806 horse-drawn plateway,<ref name=SodorMaps/> and is were the first incline was on the plateway.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\nThe station, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four_Little_Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Rhyd-yr-onen railway station|Rhyd-yr-onen station]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\nCros-ny-Curin's (fictional) etymology is that it was derived from 'Crossag-ny-cuirn', which means 'Little-Crossing-of-the-Mountain-Ash' in [[Sudric]] (Sodor's fictional language). This is a reflection of the meaning of 'Rhyd-yr-onnen' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which is 'Ash-ford'.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\n==== Glennock ====\nGlennock Station, often called 'the middle station', is a station approximately 11 miles from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe station's name is (fictionally) derived from 'Gleigh-knock', which means 'Blue-hill' in Sudric. This is the same as the Welsh meaning of [[Brynglas railway station|Bryn-Glas station]] on the Talyllyn Railway, which the station was partly based on.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\nGlennock station's positioning is based on Brynglas station on the Talyllyn Railway,<ref name=SodorMaps/><ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/> but the station itself, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Aberllefenni railway station|Aberllefenni station]] on the [[Corris Railway]].<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\n==== Rheneas ====\nRheneas, often called 'The station by the waterfalls', is a station built for tourists traffic to the nearby waterfalls. It is approximately 21 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nRheneas station, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Gallant Old Engine|Gallant Old Engine]]'', is based on [[Dolgoch railway station|Dolgoch station]] on the Talyllyn Railway.<ref name=\"GallantOldEngine\"/> 'Rheneas' means 'Divided Waterfall' in Sudric, and the station is so-named because of the nearby waterfalls, which themselves are based on the waterfalls near Dolgoch station on the Talyllyn Railway.\n\n==== Lakeside ====\nLakeside station is a station which is halfway round the ''Lakeside Loop''. It is approximately 23 miles away from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe station, and the associated ''Lakeside Loop Line'' which the station is on, was opened in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|Very Old Engines]]'', by the [[Duke of Sodor]]<ref name=\"VeryOldEngines\"/>\n\n==== Skarloey ====\nSkarloey station is the northern passenger terminus of the Skarloey Railway, although the railway continues to quarries further west. The station was built for tourists for the lake, and is approximately 22 miles from Crovan's Gate.<ref name=SodorMaps/>\n\nThe location of Skarloey station is based on a proposed station serving the hamlet of Dolffanog, a small hamlet north-east of [[Tal-y-llyn lake|Talyllyn lake]],<ref name=SodorMaps/> which featured in various 1970s proposals for an extension of the Talyllyn Railway to [[Tal-y-llyn Lake|Talyllyn lake]], [[Corris]], and [[Machynlleth]]. However, most of the station layout itself, as portrayed in ''[[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]]'', is based on [[Abergynolwyn railway station]], the eastern terminus of the Talyllyn Railway, in its pre-1976 layout.<ref name=\"FourLittleEngines\"/>\n\nSkarloey's (fictional) eytymology is that the word came from 'Scacaloey', which itself was a corruption of 'Skogarloey', which means 'Lake-in-the-Woods' in Sudric. This is based on the meaning of 'Talyllyn' (Head-of-the-lake) in Welsh.<ref name=\"ThomasTankMan\"/>\n\n=== In Thomas And Friends (in the television series) ===\nThe railway in the television series also calls at Middle, Elephant Park, Tea Room, Bluebell Valley, Mountain Village, and Rumblin Bridge.\n\nIn the television series the railway runs from The Wharf, to west to Crovan's Gate, then north south of Rheneas where a line branches off and goes to Vicarstown, The main line continues the same path it does in the Railway Series.\n\n==Appearences==\nThe Skarloey Railway first appeared in [[List of Railway Series books#Four Little Engines|Four Little Engines]], the 10<sup>th</sup> book in [[The Railway Series]], in  October 1955.

At this time it closely followed the layout as portrayed in [[The Railway Series]] books, but from [[Thomas and Friends - Season 5|Season 5]] it differed significantly, deviating further from the books at the same time as the route of the [[North Western Railway (fictional)|North Western Railway]] was significantly altered.\n\nIt appears to be part of the North Western Railway rather than an independent line. It was run by [[the Fat Controller]], but from the ninth season onwards was under the control of \"Mr Percival\", a man strongly resembling the Thin Controller (as he is often referred to in the British version. Similarly, the American version occasionally refers to him as the Narrow Gauge Controller). Mr Hugh does not appear at all.\n\nThe railway has many more carriages in this version. Ada, Jane, Mabel, Gertrude and Millicent are entirely absent. Coaches resembling Agnes, Ruth, Lucy, Jemima, Beatrice and Cora do appear along with red coaches and coaches which are green upper half and cream lower half, but are unnamed and rarely speak. Ivo Hugh (the engine) has not appeared either, as the book in which he appeared (''New Little Engine'') has not been televised. However, the line has four new engines in this version named Bertram, Mighty Mac, \"Fearless\" Freddie, who acquired the number of Ivo Hugh, and Luke. Proteus was another engine originated from the TV series. He was never seen with the other engines, but Peter Sam once tried to find him and his magic lamp. He never succeeded. Years later, Peter Sam discovered a statue of Proteus that was put on display at the Showgrounds.\n\nThe Owner also does not appear.\n\n====Television episodes featuring the Skarloey Railway engines====\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 4|Season 4]]\n**Granpuff\n**Sleeping Beauty\n**Bulldog\n**You Can't Win!\n**Four Little Engines \n**A Bad Day for Sir Handel\n**Peter Sam and the Refreshment Lady\n**Trucks/Rusty Helps Peter Sam\n**Home At Last\n**Rock 'n' Roll\n**Special Funnel\n**Steam Roller\n**Passengers and Polish\n**Gallant Old Engine\n**Rusty to the Rescue\n**Thomas and Stepney\n**Bowled Out\n**Fish (''stock footage'')\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 5|Season 5]]\n**Bye George!\n**Stepney Gets Lost\n**Toby and the Flood (''stock footage'')\n**Toby's Discovery\n**Make Someone Happy (''stock footage'')\n**Duncan Gets Spooked\n**Rusty and the Boulder\n**Snow\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 6|Season 6]]\n**Dunkin' Duncan\n**Rusty Saves the Day\n**Faulty Whistles\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 7|Season 7]]\n**James and the Queen of Sodor (''stock footage'')\n**Bulgy Rides Again (''stock footage'')\n**The Old Bridge\n**Edward's Brass Band (''deleted scene stock footage'')\n**Rheneas and the Roller Coaster\n**Trusty Rusty\n**The Refreshment Lady's Tea Shop/The Refreshment Lady's Stand\n**Harold and the Flying Horse\n**The Grand Opening\n**The Runaway Elephant\n**Not So Hasty Puddings/Not So Hasty Cakes\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 9|Season 9]]\n**Mighty Mac\n**Tuneful Toots\n**Rheneas and the Dinosaur\n**The Magic Lamp\n**Duncan and the Old Mine\n**Skarloey the Brave\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 10|Season 10]]\n**Follow that Flour\n**A Smooth Ride\n**Duncan Drops a Clanger\n**Fearless Freddie\n**Which Way Now?\n**Wharf and Peace\n**Duncan's Bluff\n**Missing Trucks/Missing Cars\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 11|Season 11]]\n**Duncan Does it All\n**Sir Handel in Charge\n**Cool Truckings\n**Ding-a-Ling\n**Skarloey Storms Through\n**Wash Behind Your Buffers\n*[[Thomas and Friends - Season 12|Season 12]]\n**Mountain Marvel\n**The Party Surprise\n**Duncan and the Hot Air Balloon\n**Push Me, Pull You\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 16)|Season 16]]\n**Don't Bother Victor!\n**The Christmas Tree Express\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 17)|Season 17]]\n**Luke's New Friend\n**The Switch\n**Gone Fishing\n*[[Thomas and Friends (series 18)|Season 18]]\n**Disappearing Diesels\n**Duncan and the Grumpy Passenger\n**Long Lost Friend\n**Duncan the Humbug\n**Emily Saves the World\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 20)|Season 20]]\n**Henry Gets the Express\n**Bradford the Brake Van\n**Saving Time\n**The Missing Breakdown Train\n**Engine of the Future\n**Tit for Tat\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 21)|Season 21]]\n**Runaway Engine\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 22)|Season 22]]\n**Tiger Trouble (''stock footage'')\n**Thomas' Animal Ark (''stock footage'')\n**The Case of the Puzzling Parts\n**Counting on Nia\n*[[Thomas & Friends (series 23)|Season 23]]\n**Chucklesome Trucks (''stock footage'')\n**Diesel Do Right\n**Steam Team to the Rescue\n**Diesel Glows Away\n*Specials\n**Calling All Engines!

{"title_page": "Cryptic crossword", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n\nA '''cryptic crossword''' is a [[crossword|crossword puzzle]] in which each clue is a word puzzle in and of itself. Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the [[United Kingdom]], where they originated,<ref name=Eliot_Brief>{{cite web|last1=Eliot |first1=George |title=Brief History of Crossword Puzzles |url=https://www.crosswordtournament.com/more/wynne.html |publisher=American Crossword Puzzle Tournament}}</ref> [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], and in several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malta]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. In the [[United States]], cryptics are sometimes known as \"British-style\" crosswords. Compilers of cryptic crosswords are commonly called \"setters\" in the [[UK]].\n\nCryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types:  the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and \"themed\" or \"variety\" cryptics, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.\n\n== History and development ==\nCryptic crosswords originated in the UK.  The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. [[Torquemada (crossword compiler)|Torquemada]] (Edward Powys Mathers), who set for ''The Saturday Westminster'' from 1925 and for ''[[The Observer]]'' from 1926 until his death in 1939, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.<ref name=mathers_strange>{{cite web|last1=Millington|first1=Roger|title=The Strange World of the Crossword (excerpt)|url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/mathers.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe first newspaper crosswords appeared in the ''Sunday'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'' from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1925, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' from 1929 and ''[[The Times]]'' from 1930.  These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread.  In some papers this took until about 1960.\n\nPuzzles appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic.\n\nTorquemada's puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter's thought processes.\n\nThe basic principle of fairness was set out by ''Listener'' setter '''Afrit''' ([[Alistair Ferguson Ritchie]]) in his book ''Armchair Crosswords'' (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional ''Book of the Crossword'':\n\n:We must expect the composer to play tricks, but we shall insist that he play fair. The Book of the Crossword lays this injunction upon him: \"You need not mean what you say, but you must say what you mean.\" This is a superior way of saying that he can't have it both ways. He may attempt to mislead by employing a form of words which can be taken in more than one way, and it is your fault if you take it the wrong way, but it is his fault if you can't logically take it the right way.\n\nAn example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:\n:''Hat could be dry (5)''\n\nHere the composer intends the answer to be \"derby\", with \"hat\" the definition, \"could be\" the anagram indicator, and \"be dry\" the anagram fodder. I.e., \"derby\" is an anagram of \"be dry\". But \"be\" is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form \"[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]\" fails: if \"be\" is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator; to be a correct clue it would have to be \"Hat could '''be be''' dry (5)\", which is ungrammatical. A variation might read ''Hat turns out to be dry (5)'', but this also fails because the word \"to\", which is necessary to make the sentence grammatical, follows the indicator (\"turns out\") even though it is not part of the anagram indicated.\n\nTorquemada's successor at ''The Observer'' was '''Ximenes''' ([[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]], 1902\u20131971), and in his influential work, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle'' (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as \"Ximenean principles\" and sometimes described by the word \"square-dealing\".<ref>Reissued Aug 2001: Swallowtail Books {{ISBN|1-903400-04-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-903400-04-3}}</ref> The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes' successor '''[[Azed]]''' ([[Jonathan Crowther]], born 1942):\n\n:A good cryptic clue contains three elements:\n:# a precise definition\n:# a fair subsidiary indication\n:# nothing else\n\nThe Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of \"advanced cryptics\" \u2014 difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' setter '''Araucaria''' ([[John Galbraith Graham]], 1921&ndash;2013) was a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.\n\n== Popularity ==\nMost of the major national [[newspaper]]s in the UK carry both cryptic and concise (quick) crosswords in every issue. The puzzle in ''[[The Guardian]]'' is well loved for its humour and quirkiness, and quite often includes puzzles with themes, which are extremely rare in ''The Times''.<ref>How to master the Times Crossword, Tim Moorey, p. 186</ref>\n\nMany Canadian newspapers, including the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', carry cryptic crosswords.\n\nCryptic crosswords do not commonly appear in U.S. publications, although they can be found in magazines such as ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', and occasionally in the Sunday ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' reprints cryptic crosswords from ''The Times''. In April 2018, [[The New Yorker]] published the first of a new weekly series of cryptic puzzles.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Remnick |first1=David |authorlink1=David Remnick |title=Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle |url=https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Other sources of cryptic crosswords in the U.S. (at various difficulty levels) are puzzle books, as well as UK and Canadian newspapers distributed in the U.S. Other venues include the ''Enigma'', the magazine of the [[National Puzzlers' League]], and formerly, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. The latter puzzle, after a long and distinguished run, appeared solely on ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website for several years, and ended with the October 2009 issue.  A similar puzzle by the same authors now appears monthly in ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/ The Wall Street Journal]''.\n\nCryptic crosswords are very popular in Australia. Most Australian newspapers will have at least one cryptic crossword, if not two. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' in [[Melbourne]] publish daily cryptic crosswords, including Friday's challenging cryptic by 'DA' ([[David Astle]]). \"Lovatts\", an Australian puzzle publisher, regularly issues cryptic crossword puzzle books.\n\n== How cryptic clues work ==\nIn essence, a cryptic clue leads to its answer as long as it is read in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the ''surface reading'') is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with the clue answer.  The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution.\n\nA typical clue consists of two parts, the definition and the wordplay. It provides two ways of getting to the answer. The definition, which usually exactly matches the [[part of speech]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], and [[grammatical number|number]] of the answer, is in essence the same as any 'straight' crossword clue, a synonym for the answer. It usually appears at the start or the end of a clue.\n\nThe other part (the ''subsidiary indication'', or ''wordplay'') provides an alternative route to the answer (this part would be a second definition in the case of double definition clues). One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between definition and wordplay and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue ''cryptically''. This wordplay gives the solver some instructions on how to get to the answer another way. (Sometimes the two parts are joined with a link word or phrase such as \"from\", \"gives\" or \"could be\".)\n\nThere are many sorts of wordplay, such as anagrams and double definitions, but they all conform to rules. The crossword setters do their best to stick to these rules when writing their clues, and solvers can use these rules and conventions to help them solve the clues. Noted cryptic setter [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]] (who wrote cryptics under the pseudonym of Ximenes) discusses the importance and art of fair cluemanship in his seminal book on cryptic crosswords, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword'' (1966, reprinted 2001).<ref>{{cite book |last=Macnutt |first=Derrick |title=Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword  |year=2001 |publisher=Swallowtail Books |location=London |isbn=1-903400-04-X |pages=42\u201353}}</ref>\n\nBecause a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. The clues are 'self-checking'. This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.\n\nHere is an example (taken from ''[[The Guardian]]'' crossword of 6 August 2002, set by \"Shed\").\n\n:15D ''Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)''\n\nis a clue for <small>TRAGICAL</small>.  This breaks down as follows.\n*15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid\n*\"Very sad\" is the definition\n*\"unfinished story\" gives \"tal\" (\"tale\" with one letter missing; i.e., unfinished)\n*\"rising smoke\" gives \"ragic\" (a \"cigar\" is a smoke and this is a down clue so \"rising\" indicates that \"cigar\" should be written up the page; i.e., backwards)\n*\"about\" means that the letters of \"tal\" should be put either side of \"ragic\", giving \"tragical\"\n*\"(8)\" says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.\n\nThere are many \"code words\" or \"indicators\" that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, \"about\", \"unfinished\" and \"rising\" all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.\n\n[[#Compilers|Compilers]] or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these is important for the solver. Abbreviations may be as simple as 'west' = W, 'New York' = NY, but may also be more difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crossword365.com/pages/cryptic-abbreviations |title=Cryptic crossword abbreviations |accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited; often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:\n\n* Bloomer - often means flower (a thing that blooms).\n* Flower - often means river (a thing that flows).\n* Lead - could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.\n* Nice - if capitalized as the first word, could either be \"amiable\" or the French city.  Thus \"Nice friend\" often means the letters ''ami''.\n* Novel - could be a book, or a word for new, or a code-word indicating an anagram.\n* Permit - could be a noun (meaning license) or a verb (meaning allow).\n\nOf these examples, \"flower\" is an invented meaning by back-formation from the -er suffix, which cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary.  A similar trick is played in the old clue \"A wicked thing\" for CANDLE, where the -ed suffix must be understood in its \"equipped with a ...\" meaning.  In the case of the -er suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for river \u2192 BANKER (a river is not a 'thing that banks' but a 'thing that has banks'), this is rarely done.\n\nSometimes \"compiler\", or the name or codename of the compiler (if visible by the crossword), codes for some form of the pronoun \"I, me, my, mine\".\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' back page, Monday 15 March 2017, 7 down, is \"Banish spirits with zero ice upsetting imbibing times (8)\"; the answer is <small>EXORCIZE</small>: it means \"banish spirits\", and is \"zero ice\" rearranged, including 'x' (described as \"times\").\n\n== Grids for cryptic crosswords ==\n[[File:British crossword.svg|thumb|A lattice-style grid common for cryptic crosswords]]\n\nA typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15\u00d715, with half-turn [[rotational symmetry]].  Unlike typical American [[crosswords]], in which every square is almost always ''checked'' (that is, each square provides a letter for both an across and a down answer), only about half of the squares in a cryptic crossword are checked.\n\nIn most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids.  In the past this was because [[hot metal typesetting]] meant that new grids were expensive.<ref>{{cite news\n|last=Tossman\n|first=David\n|title=Crossword 847 answers and explanations\n|date=23 November 2013\n|url=https://www.listener.co.nz/entertainment/cryptic-crosswords/crossword-847-answers-and-explanations/\n|newspaper=[[New Zealand Listener]]\n}}</ref>\n\nSome papers have additional grid rules. In ''[[The Times]]'', for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word.  The grid shown here breaks one ''Times'' grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15.  ''[[The Independent]]'' allows setters to use their own grid designs.\n\nVariety (UK: \"advanced\") cryptic crosswords typically use a \"barred grid\" with no black squares and a slightly smaller size; 12&times;12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called \"bars\".  In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; unclued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved.  The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.\n\nA July 2006 \"Puzzlecraft\" section in [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]] on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword.  In most UK \"advanced cryptics\" ('variety cryptic'), at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.\n\n== Regional variation ==\n\n=== British and North American differences ===\nThere are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one; e.g., a ''triple definition'' clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.\n\n=== Other languages ===\nFor the most part, cryptic crosswords are an [[English-language]] phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form in [[Israel]] (where they are called ''tashbetsey higayon'' (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df) \"Logic crosswords\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuckermann.org/cryptic.html|title=One of Dr Ghil`ad Zuckermann's Cryptic Crosswords|publisher=}}</ref> and (as ''Cryptogram'')  in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In Poland similar crosswords are called \"[[Hetman]] crosswords\". 'Hetman', a senior commander, and also the name for a [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[Chess]], emphasises their importance over other crosswords. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], this type of crossword puzzle is known as ''piilosana'' (literally \"hidden word\"), while ''krypto'' refers to a crossword puzzle where the letters have been coded as numbers. The [[Germany|German]] ''ZEITmagazin'' has a weekly cryptic crossword called ''Um die Ecke gedacht'' and the ''SZ Magazin'' features ''das Kreuz mit den Worten''.\n\nIn India the [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] publication [[Sakshi (newspaper)|Sakshi]] carries a \"Tenglish\" (Telugu-English, bilingual) cryptic crossword;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/09/how-kishore-solved-tenglish-crossword.html|title=Tenglish crossword|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 29 September 2012.}}</ref> the [[Prajavani]] and [[Vijaya Karnataka]] crossword ([[Kannada Language|Kannada]]) also employs cryptic wordplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/08/kannada-crosswords.html|title=Kannada crosswords: Prajavani, Udayavani, Kannada Prabha|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 22 August 2012.}}</ref> Enthusiasts have also created cryptic crosswords in Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2014/08/prize-hindi-puzzle-winner.html|title=Prize Hindi Puzzle: Here's Our Winner|publisher=}}</ref> Since 1994, ''enigmista'' [[w:it:Ennio Peres|Ennio Peres]] has challenged Italians annually with ''[http://www.parole.tv/xw/cruciperes.asp Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo]'' (The World's Most Difficult Crossword), which has many features in common with English-style cryptics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/07/22/il-cruciverba-piu-difficile-del-mondo/1893519/|title=Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo|author=Dario De Toffoli|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese something similar is the [[riddle]] of Chinese characters, where partial characters instead of substrings are clued and combined.\n\n== Types of cryptic clues ==\nClues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay.  Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it: one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved.  In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of [[#\"& lit.\"|\"& lit.\"]] clues.  Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word: \"cryptic crossword\" would be clued with \"(7,9)\" following the clue.  More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.\n\n=== Anagrams ===\n[[File:Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT.gif|thumb|Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT]]\nAn [[anagram]] is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by words such as \"strange\", \"bizarre\", \"muddled\", \"wild\", \"drunk\", or any other term indicating change. One example:\n\n:''Chaperone shredded corset (6)''\n\ngives <small>ESCORT</small>, which means ''chaperone'' and is an anagram of ''corset'', indicated by the word ''shredded''.\n\nAnagram clues are characterized by an indicator word adjacent to a phrase that has the same number of letters as the answer. The indicator tells the solver that there is an [[anagram]] they need to solve to work out the answer. Indicators come either before or after the letters to be anagrammed. In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and ''then'' anagrammed. So in this clue:\n\n:''Chew honeydew fruit (5)''\n\n''Chew'' is the anagram indicator; ''honeydew'' clues ''melon'', which is to be anagrammed; and ''fruit'' is the definition for the answer, <small>LEMON</small>.  This kind of clue is called an ''indirect anagram'', which in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords are not used, ever since they were criticised by 'Ximenes' in his 1966 book ''On the Art of the Crossword''.  Minor exception: simple abbreviations may be used to spice up the process; e.g., \"Husband, a most eccentric fellow\" (6) for THOMAS, where the anagram is made from A, MOST, and H = husband.\n\nAnagram indicators, among the thousands possible, include: about, abstract, absurd, adapted, adjusted, again, alien, alternative, anew, another, around, arranged, assembled, assorted, at sea, awful, awkward, bad, barmy, becomes, blend, blow, break, brew, build, careless, changed, chaotic, characters, clumsy, composed, confused, contrived, convert, cooked, corrupt, could be, crazy, damaged, dancing, designed, develop, different, disorderly, disturbed, doctor, eccentric, edited, engineer, fabricate, fake, fancy, faulty, fiddled, fix, foolish, form, free, fudge, gives, ground, hammer, haywire, hybrid, improper, in a tizzy, involved, irregular, jostle, jumbled, jumping, kind of, knead, letters, loose, made, managed, maybe, messy, mistaken, mix, modified, moving, muddled, mutant, new, novel, odd, off, order, organised, otherwise, out, outrageous, peculiar, perhaps, playing, poor, possible, prepared, produced, queer, questionable, random, reform, remodel, repair, resort, rough, shaken, shifting, silly, sloppy, smashed, somehow, sort, spoilt, strange, style, switch, tangled, treated, tricky, troubled, turning, twist, unconventional, undone, unsettled, unsound, untidy, unusual, upset, used, vary, version, warped, wayward, weird, wild, working, wrecked, wrong.\n\nIt is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of anagram indicator and anagram that form a common phrase to make the clue appear as much like a 'normal' sentence or phrase as possible.  For example:\n\n:''Lap dancing friend (3)''\n\nuses ''dancing'' as the indicator as it fits cohesively with ''lap'' to give the solution, <small>PAL</small>.\n\n=== Charade ===\nHere, the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).\n\nFor example:\n\n:''Outlaw leader managing money (7)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BANKING</small> formed by <small>BAN</small> for \"outlaw\" and <small>KING</small> for \"leader\". The definition is \"managing money\". With this example, the words appear in the same order in the clue as they do in the answer, and no special words are needed to indicate this. However, the order of the parts is sometimes indicated with words such as \"against\", \"after\", \"on\", \"with\" or \"above\" (in a down clue).\n\n=== Containers ===\nA container clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:\n\n:''Apostle's friend outside of university (4)''\n\ngives <small>PAUL</small> (\"apostle\"), by placing \"pal\" (\"friend\") outside of \"U\" (\"university\"); the \"'s\" could be treated as the [[genitive]] case suffix or as short for \"is\".\n\nA similar example:\n\n:''Utter nothing when there's wickedness about (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>VOICE</small> (\"utter\"), formed by placing \"O\" (\"nothing\") inside the word \"vice\" (\"wickedness\").\n\nOther container indicators are \"inside\", \"over\", \"around\", \"about\", \"clutching\", \"enters\", and the like.\n\n=== Deletions ===\nDeletions consist of ''beheadments'', ''curtailments'', and ''internal deletions''.  In beheadments, a word loses its first letter.  In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.\n\nAn example of a beheadment:\n\n:''Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>TAR</small>, another word for \"sailor\", which is a \"celebrity\", or star, without the first letter.\n\nOther indicator words of beheadment include \"don't start\", \"topless\", and \"after the first\".\n\nAn example of curtailment:\n\n:''Shout, \"Read!\" endlessly (3)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BOO</small>.  If you ignore the punctuation, a book is a \"read\", and book \"endlessly\" is ''boo'', a \"shout\".\n\nOther indicators include \"nearly\" and \"unfinished\".\n\nAn example of internal deletion:\n\n:''Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)''\n\nThe answer is <small>DARING</small>, which means \"challenging\", and is darling without its middle letter, or \"heartlessly\".\n\nNote that \"sweetheart\" could also be simply \"wee\" or the letter \"E\", that is, the \"heart\" (middle) of \"sweet\".\n\n=== Double definition ===\nA clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:\n\n: ''Not seeing window covering (5)''\n\nwould have the answer <small>BLIND</small>, because ''blind'' can mean both \"not seeing\" and \"window covering\". Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:\n\n: ''Eastern European buff (6)''\n\nThis takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of <small>POLISH</small>, the one with the long \"o\" sound meaning \"someone from Poland\" and the one with the short \"o\" sound meaning \"make shiny\".\n\nThese clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.\n\nIn the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used; e.g.:\n\n: ''Blue swallow feathers fell from above (4)''\n\nis a quintuple definition of <small>DOWN</small> (\"blue\" (sad), \"swallow\" (drink), \"feathers\" (plumage), \"fell\" (cut down) and \"from above\"),<ref>Arachne (30 January 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26170 Cryptic crossword No 26,170], ''The Guardian''</ref> but in the US this would be considered unsound.\n\nSome British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:\n\n: ''Let in or let on (5)'' \u2013 <small>ADMIT</small>\n\nNote that these clues do not have clear indicator words.\n\n=== Hidden words ===\nWhen the answer appears in the clue but is contained within one or more words, it is hidden.  For example:\n\n:''Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)''\n\ngives <small>UNDERMINED</small>, which means (cryptically at least) \"damaged\" and can be found as part of \"Fo'''und ermine d'''eer\". The word \"hides\" is used to mean \"contains,\" but in the surface sense suggests \"pelts\". A complication is that \"damaged\" often (but not in this clue) means \"rearrange the letters\".\n\nPossible indicators of a hidden clue are \"in part\", \"partially\", \"in\", \"within\", \"hides\", \"conceals\", \"some\", and \"held by\".\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)''\n\ngives <small>DOG</small>, which is the first part of, or \"introduction to\", the word \"do-gooder\", and means \"canine\".\nHidden words clues are sometimes called \"Embedded words\" or \"Telescopic clues\". The opposite of a hidden word clue, where letters ''missing'' from a sentence have to be found, is known as a [[Printer's Devilry]], and appears in some advanced cryptics.\n\nThere are several common techniques used in Hidden Word clues.\n\n==== Initial letters ====\nThe first letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.\n\nAn example of an initialism:\n\n:''Initially amiable person eats primate (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>APE</small>, which is a type of primate. \"Initially\" signals that you must take the first letters of \"'''a'''miable '''p'''erson '''e'''ats\" \u2013 \"ape\".\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n:''At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)''\n\nThe answer would be [[Annie (musical)|<small>ANNIE</small>]], the name of a famous orphan in musical theatre. This is obtained from the first letters of \"actor needing new identity emulates\".\n\nWords that indicate initialisms also include \"firstly\" and \"to start\".\n\nIt is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue.  It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:\n\n:''Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>DAHOMEY</small>, which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an \"old country\"). Here, we take the first letters of only the words \"Head Office\" (ho) and we take the \"end\" of the word \"day\" (y). The letters of the word \"dame\", meaning \"lady\", are then made to go around the letters \"ho\" to form Dahomey.\n\n==== Odd/even letters ====\nEither the odd or even letters of words in the clue give the answer. An example is:\n\n:''Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>SUFFRAGIST</small>, which is \"someone wanting women to vote\". The word \"odd\" indicates that we must take every other letter of the rest of the clue, starting with the first: StUfF oF mR wAuGh Is SeT.\n\n=== Homophones ===\n[[Homophone]]s are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as \"night\" and \"knight\".  Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with phonetics, such as \"reportedly\", \"they say\", \"utterly\" (here treated as \"utter(ing)-ly\" and not with its usual meaning), \"vocal\", \"to the audience\", \"auditioned\", \"by the sound of it\", \"is heard\", \"in conversation\" and \"on the radio\". \"Broadcast\" is a particularly devious indicator as it could indicate either a homophone or an anagram.\n\nAn example of a homophone clue is\n\n:''We hear twins shave (4)''\n\nwhich is a clue for <small>PARE</small>, which means \"shave\" and is a homophone of pair, or \"twins\".  The homophone is indicated by \"we hear\".\n\nIf the two words are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the homophone indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, \"we hear\" was adjacent to \"twins\" and the answer was ''pare'' rather than ''pair''. The indicator could come between the words if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of \"right\" and \"rite\".\n\n=== Letter Banks ===\nThe letter bank form of cluing consists of a shorter word (or words) containing no repeated letters (an \"isogram\"), and a longer word or phrase built by using each of these letters (but no others) at least once but repeating them as often as necessary. This type of clue has been described by American constructors Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto, who write the weekly puzzle for The Nation. The shorter word is typically at least three or four letters in length, while the target word or phrase is at least three letters longer than the bank word. For example, the four letters in the word TENS can be used as a bank to form the word TENNESSEE. Typically, the clue contains indicator words such as \"use,\" \"take,\" or \"implement\" to signal that a letter bank is being employed.\n\nA more complicated example of a letter bank is:\n\n: ''Composer taking and retaking ingredients of Advil? Not! (7,7)''\n\nIn this case, \"ingredients\" signals that the letters of both \"Advil\" and \"Not\" form the bank. Those letters yield the answer, ANTONIO VIVALDI. \n\nKosman and Picciotto consider this to be a newer and more complicated form of cluing that offers another way, besides the anagram, of mixing and recombining letters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/going-bank/|title=Going to the Bank {{!}} The Nation|last=Picciotto|first=Joshua Kosman and Henri|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\n=== Reversals ===\nA word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:\n\n:''Returned beer fit for a king (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>REGAL</small>. \"Lager\" (i.e., \"beer\") is \"returned\" to make ''regal,'' i.e. fit for a king.\n\nOther indicator words include \"receding\", \"in the mirror\", \"going the wrong way\", \"returns\", \"reverses\" \"to the left\" or \"left\" (for across clues), and \"rising\", \"overturned\" or \"mounted\" or \"comes up\" (for down clues).\n\n=== Cryptic definition ===\nHere the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another.  For example:\n\n:''Flower of London?'' (6)\n\ngives <small>THAMES</small>, a flow-er of London.  Here, the surface reading suggests a blossom, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required. Notice the question mark: this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion.  The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its ''surface reading'' and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue's component words.\n\nThis type of clue is common in British and Canadian cryptics but is a bit less common in American cryptics; in American-style crosswords, a clue like this is generally called a punny clue. It's almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.\n\n=== Spoonerism ===\nA relatively uncommon clue type, a [[Spoonerism]] is a play on words where corresponding [[consonant cluster]]s are switched between two words in a phrase (or syllables in a word) and the switch forms another pair of proper ''sounding'' words. For example: \"butterfly\" = \"flutter by\".\n\nBoth the solution word or phrase and its corresponding Spoonerism are clued for, and the clue type is almost always indicated by reference to Spooner himself \u2013 with some regions/publications insisting his religious title \"Rev.\" or \"Reverend\" be included. In contrast to all other clue types, this makes them almost impossible to disguise. But that doesn't necessarily make them easy.\n\nAn example of a Spoonerism clue is:\n\n:''He will casually put down Spooner's angry bear (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>LITTERBUG</small> (''He will casually put down''). The Spoonerism is \"bitter\" (''angry'') and \"lug\" (''bear, as in carry'').\n\nThe vast majority of Spoonerism clues swap the first consonants of words or syllables, but Spoonerisms are not strictly restricted to that form and some setters will take advantage of this. John Henderson (Enigmatist in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]) once clued for the Spoonerism \"light crick\" from \"right click\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=John|title=(Enigmatist)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25930|work=Cryptic crossword No 25,930|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|date=24 April 2013}}</ref> which didn't sit well with many solvers.\n\n=== \"&lit.\" ===\nAn \"&lit.\" or \"Literal\" clue is not a clue type, but, rather a variant on an existing clue. \"&lit\" stands for \"and literally so\". In this case, the entire clue is both a definition and a cryptic clue. In some publications &lit clues are indicated by an [[exclamation mark]] at the end of the clue.  For example:\n\n:''God incarnate, essentially! (4)''\n\nThe answer is <small>ODIN</small>. The Norse god [[Odin]] is hidden in \"g'''od in'''carnate\", as clued by \"essentially\", but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.\n\nThis satisfies the \"& lit.\" clue definition but as read is clearly a cryptic clue.  Another example:\n\n:''Spoil vote! (4)''\n\nwould give the answer <small>VETO</small>; in the cryptic sense, ''spoil'' works as an [[anagram]] indicator for ''vote'', while the whole clue is, with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters, a definition.\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''e.g., Origin of goose (3)''\n\ngives the answer <small>EGG</small>. Geese find their origins in eggs, so the whole clue gives \"egg\", but the clue can also be broken down: e.g., loses its full stops to give ''eg'', followed by the first letter (i.e., the \"origin\") of the word goose\u2014''g''\u2014to make ''egg''.\n\n''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 22 April 2014 has: \"Dog in wild? Yes! (5)\"; the answer is <small>[[dingo|DINGO]]</small>. \"Dog in wild\" means \"rearrange the letters of \"<small>DOG IN</small>\", '''and''' is the definition.\n\n== Clueing techniques ==\n\n=== Combination clues ===\nIt is very common for a clue to employ more than one method of wordplay.  For example:\n\n:''Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>HONORABLE</small>.  \"Baron\" \"returns\", or is reversed, and put inside \"pit\" or hole, to make ''honorable'', or \"illustrious\".\n\nIn this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types:\n\n:''Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6)''\n\nThe answer to this clue is <small>ROTTEN</small>. The phrase \"to turn\" indicates \"to reverse,\" and \"part of\" suggests a piece of \"Internet torrid\".\n\n=== Misleading clues ===\n\nTo make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner.\n\n*A cryptic crossword on the back page of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' on 14 March 2012 included the answer <small>ANALYSIS</small>, whose clue was \"Close study of broken '''nails''', '''say''' (8)\": \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is part of an anagram.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' back page, 8 November 2012: \"Drunk compiler's admitted boob (5)\" means \"Means 'drunk', <small>MY</small> contains <small>ERR</small>, has 5 letters\", = <small>MERRY</small>. (\"Drunk\" often mean \"rearrange the letters\", but not this time.)\n* In a crossword by ''[[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]]'', \"Araucaria is\" coded for <small>IAM</small> (= \"I am\") as part of an answer.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 25 February 2014: \"French place in island beset by cold sadly\": \"sadly\" usually means \"damaged\", \"with the letters rearranged\", but here it codes for \"alas\"; <small>I</small> inside <small>C ALAS</small> makes <small>CALAIS</small>, which is a French place.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 3 April 2014: \"Bug starts to '''m'''ove '''i'''n '''d'''ark, '''g'''lowing '''e'''ndlessly (5)\": usually \"endlessly\" and similar mean \"remove the last letter\", but here it is one of five consecutive words to form an [[acronym]] from, as the word \"starts\" shows; the answer is <small>MIDGE</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 18, 1 September 2015: 4 down: \"How one may find Etna to increase danger? (2,3,4)\": the answer (<small>UP THE ANTE</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>ETNA</small>, which is the reverse of usual.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 27 March 2017: 10 down: \"One might see flow in this game (8)\":  the answer (<small>WILDFOWL</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>FLOW</small>, which is the reverse of usual; \"game\" is as in sport shooting.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 16, 2 May 2017: 1 across: \"Schoolchild's punishment, devising a cryptic clue for 'crows'? (7,5)\": the answer is <small>HUNDRED LINES</small>: reverse of the usual way to use a Roman number.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 14 November 2017: 28 across: \"Very old diamonds, say (5)\": <small>V O ICE</small>: \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is the definition; the word \"voice\" can be used as a verb.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 34, 22 March 2018: 3 down: \"Trouble from win<u>d is turb</u>ulent\": answer is <small>DISTURB</small>; the word \"turbulent\" suggests forming an anagram, which does not happen here.\n* A clue in the ''Daily Telegraph'' September 2018 started \"Communist leader\", which would be expected to mean the letter C; but this time it was the definition, and the answer was <small>CHE GUEVARA</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 3 June 2019: 20 down: \"Discover the truth about \\ gang fight in New York City\": both parts are definitions of \"[[wikt:rumble|<small>RUMBLE</small>]]\" :: in a British newspaper, although \"rumble\" for \"gang fight\" is American [[street gang]] jargon.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 21 June 2019: 12 across: \"Greek goddess, flanked by banks of [[Tigris]] in ancient city (6)\": The Greek goddess is [[Hebe (mythology)|<small>HEBE</small>]], not one much known of; between the first and last letters of <small>TIGRIS</small>, makes [[Thebes, Greece|<small>THEBES</small>]]; \"ancient city\" usually means [[Ur|<small>UR</small>]], but not here.\n\n=== Clues valid only on particular days or in particular areas ===\n* A cryptic crossword in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' on [[Easter Sunday]] 2014 had an anagram clue whose answer was <small>EASTER SUNDAY</small>, and its definition part was \"today\".\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' on 8 April 2019, page 30: 5 down: \"Parade one month ago (5,4)\": its answer was <small>MARCH PAST</small>; that clue would be valid only in April each year.\n* In a cryptic crossword in the British newspaper ''Daily Telegraph'' (20 April 2017), the clue \"''Irritating proverb we're told (4)'' (<small>SORE</small> = \"[[wikt:saw#Etymology 2|saw]]\") depends on a [[homophony]] which only happens in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation such as in British English.\n\n== Bits and pieces ==\nAbbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for cluing individual letters or short sections of the answer. Consider this clue:\n\n''About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)''\n\n:There are two abbreviations used here.  \"About\" is abbreviated \"c\" (for \"circa\"), and \"little Desmond\" indicates that the [[diminutive]] of Desmond (namely, DES) is required.  The \"c\" is \"to come between\" DES and ANT (a worker; note that compilers also use \"worker\" to stand for BEE or HAND), giving [[wikt:descant|DESCANT]], which means \"discourse\".\n\nCompilers use many of these [[crossword abbreviations]].\n\nAnother type of abbreviation in clues might be words that refer to letters. For example, 'you' refers to the letter U, 'why' refers to the letter Y, etc. A clue for instance:\n\n:''For example, why didn't you put the country? (5)''\n\n:The answer is \"<small>EGYPT</small>\". Three abbreviations are used here. \"For example\" is abbreviated to the letters E and G (for \"e.g.\"), \"why\" indicates the letter Y. The phrase \"didn't you put\" is the letters P and T (the word \"you\" refers to U, and word \"didn't\" means that the letter U in \"put\" should be left out, making it PT). Adding those letters together gets \"the country\" - EGYPT.\n\nThere are many ways in which constructors can clue a part of a clue. In this clue:\n\n''Exclamation of surprise about spectacles, from the top (3)''\n\n:The word \"spectacles\" clues OO because these letters look like a pair of spectacles \"from the top\". The answer is thus COO, which is an \"exclamation of surprise\" with C coming from \"circa\", clued by \"about\".\n\nOften, Roman numerals are used to break down words into their component letter groups. E.g. In this clue:\n\n''A team's first supporter is pivotal (4)''\n\n:The answer is AXIS, and the direct meaning is conveyed by the words \"is pivotal\". The first A is followed by \"XI\" which is Roman for 11 (refers to the number of players on the field in a cricket or [[soccer]] team). \"First supporter\" refers to the letter \"S\" which is the first letter of the word \"supporter\".\n\n== Clueing technique and difficulty ==\nCryptic clue styles across newspapers are ostensibly similar, but there are technical differences which result in the work of setters being regarded as either Ximenean or Libertarian (and often a combination of both).\n\nXimenean rules are very precise in terms of grammar and syntax, especially as regards the indicators used for various methods of wordplay. Libertarian setters may use devices which \"more or less\" get the message across. For example, when treating the answer BEER the setter may decide to split the word into BEE and R and, after finding suitable ways to define the answer and BEE, now looks to give the solver a clue to the letter R. Ximenean rules would not allow something like \"reach first\" to indicate that R is the first letter of \"reach\" because, grammatically, that is not what \"reach first\" implies. Instead, a phrase along the lines of \"first to reach\" would be needed as this conforms to rules of grammar. Many Libertarian crossword editors would, however, accept \"reach first\" as it would be considered to reasonably get the idea across. For instance, a clue following Ximenean rules for BEER (BEE + R) may look as such:\n:''Stinger first to reach drink (4)''\nWhile a clue following Libertarian rules may look as follows:\n:''Stinger reaches first drink (4)''\n\n''The Guardian'' is perhaps the most Libertarian of cryptic crosswords, while ''The Times'' is mostly Ximenean. The others tend to be somewhere in between; the ''Financial Times'' and ''Independent'' tend towards Ximenean, the ''Daily Telegraph'' also \u2013 although its Toughie crossword can take a very Libertarian approach depending on the setter.  None of the major daily cryptics in the UK is \"strictly Ximenean\"; all allow clues which are just cryptic definitions, and strict Ximenean rules exclude such clues.  There are other differences like nounal anagram indicators and in current ''Times'' crosswords, unindicated definition by example: \"bay\" in the clue indicating HORSE in the answer, without a qualification like \"bay, perhaps\".\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Libertarian clues can seem impenetrable to inexperienced solvers. However, more significant is the setter him/herself. Crosswords in the ''Times'' and ''Daily Telegraph'' are published anonymously, so the crossword editor ensures that clues adhere to a consistent house style. Inevitably each setter has an individual (and often very recognisable) approach to clue-writing, but the way in which wordplay devices are used and indicated is kept within a defined set of rules.\n\nIn the ''Guardian'', ''Independent'', ''Financial Times'' and ''Telegraph'' Toughie series the setters' pseudonyms are published, so solvers become familiar with the styles of individual setters rather than house rules. Thus the level of difficulty is associated with the setter rather than the newspaper, though puzzles by individual setters can actually vary in difficulty considerably.\n\nIt is effectively impossible, then, to describe one newspaper's crosswords as the toughest or easiest. For newcomers to cryptic puzzles the ''Daily Telegraph'' is often regarded as an ideal starting point, but this is contentious. Since all of the newspapers have different styles, concentrating on one of them is likely to lead to proficiency in only one style of clue-writing; moving to a different series, after perhaps years spent with just one, can leave the solver feeling as if they have gone back to square one. The better technique is to simply attempt as many different crosswords as possible, perhaps to find a \"comfort zone\" but, more importantly, to experience the widest possible range of Ximenean/Libertarian styles.\n\n== Cryptic crosswords in specific publications ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn Britain it is traditional \u2014 dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer [[Edward Powys Mathers|Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers]] (1892\u20131939), who called himself \"Torquemada\" after the Spanish [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisitor]] \u2014 for compilers to use evocative pseudonyms. \"Crispa\", named from the Latin for \"curly-headed\", who set crosswords for the ''Guardian'' from 1954<ref>A Display of Lights (9), Val Gilbert, 2008 - p. 155</ref> until her retirement in 2004, legally changed her surname to \"Crisp\" after divorcing in the 1970s.  Some pseudonyms have obvious connotations: for example, Torquemada as already described, or \"Mephisto\" with fairly obvious devilish overtones.  Others are chosen for logical but less obvious reasons, though \"Dinmutz\" (the late Bert Danher in the ''Financial Times'') was produced by random selection of [[Scrabble]] tiles.\n\n;''The Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph''\n:The ''Telegraph'', like the ''Times'', does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the ''Times'', has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters include John Halpern, Ray Terrell, Jeremy Mutch, Don Manley, Allan Smith, Steve Bartlett and Richard Palmer. The regular setters as of 1 November 2006 are shown in a photograph [http://www.crossword.org.uk/valgilbert.htm here]. The crossword editor is Chris Lancaster, who took over from Phil McNeill in early 2018.  There is an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', and also a 15&times;15 blocked-grid puzzle.\n\n:In September 2008 the ''Telegraph'' started printing a 'Toughie' crossword as well as the daily puzzle, from Tuesday to Friday.  This is described by the paper as \"the toughest crossword in Fleet Street\" or similar and does include the setter's pseudonym.  Comments from some solvers on these puzzles don't always agree with this assessment, rating maybe half of them as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty.\n\n;''The Guardian''\n:Notable compilers of ''[[The Guardian]]'''s cryptic crosswords include Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul (John Halpern again), Rufus (now retired), and the late [[Bob Smithies]] (Bunthorne) and [[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]].  The puzzle is edited by Hugh Stephenson.\n\n;''The Independent''\n:''The Independent'' went online only in 2016, but still has a cryptic crossword. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Anax, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk ([[John Halpern]]).  The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson).\n\n;''i''\n:The ''i'' newspaper was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent, but was bought by Johnston Press in February 2016 when The Independent moved to digital-only publication. The fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by John Henderson whose predecessor was the late former ''Times'' crossword editor Mike Laws. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina: a hidden feature. \n\n;''The National''\n:Launched in Scotland as \"The Newspaper that supports an independent Scotland\" on 24 November 2014 after the independence referendum on 18 September. The National has a daily cryptic crossword after a request from readers to include one. The National is the only daily pro-independence newspaper in Scotland and is edited by Sunday Herald editor Richard Walker.\n\n;''The Observer''\n:Home of the famous [[Azed]] crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics, and in conjunction with its predecessors 'Torquemada' and 'Ximenes' is the longest-running series of barred-grid puzzles. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today's top compilers have learnt their trade. ''The Observer'' also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.\n\n;''Private Eye''\n:In the early 1970s the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' had a crossword set by the Labour MP [[Tom Driberg]], under the pseudonym of \"Tiresias\" (supposedly \"a distinguished academic churchman\"). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name \"Cyclops\". This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqu\u00e9 to rude, in clues, answers and the solver's head; much of the rudeness is by innuendo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example, the current monarch of the UK is \"Brenda\" and the likely next one \"Prince Brian\".  The \u00a3100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n;''The Radio Times''\n:Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.\n\n;''Significance''\n:[[Significance (magazine)|''Significance'']] is a joint publication between the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society; it contains a cryptic crossword in its puzzle section.  The magazine offers a randomly awarded $150 or \u00a3100 to spend on [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] books for those that submit a correct entry.\n\n;''The Spectator''\n:Cryptics in the weekly ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event that has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the ''Spectator'' is numbered: in the ''Spectator'''s case, a puzzle's theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event that occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for 'Pseudonym') and Columba.\n\n;''The Sunday Times''\n:''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cryptic crossword is compiled in rotation by three setters: Jeff Pearce, Dean Mayer and David McLean, the latter taking over from Tim Moorey in January 2016. (Mr Moorey's final puzzle included the hidden message 'Farewell from Tim'; he continues to set Mephisto puzzles.) The position of puzzles editor is now held by Peter Biddlecombe. Until her retirement in December 2010, Barbara Hall was puzzles editor for 32 years, and wrote about half the paper's cryptic crosswords. The ''Sunday Times'' is also home to the difficult barred-grid Mephisto puzzle, currently set in rotation by Don Manley, Paul McKenna and Tim Moorey. Previous Mephisto setters were Richard Kilner (only setter, 1959 to 1973), Richard Whitelegg (only setter, 1973 to 1995), Chris Feetenby (1995-2008) and Mike Laws (1995-2011).<ref>The Sunday Times Mephisto Crossword Book 1, 2003 - Introduction</ref>\n\n;''The Times''\n:[[Adrian Bell]] was the first to set [[The Times|The ''Times'']] crossword from 1930<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/article5976721.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The Times crossword the man who began it all | first=Oliver | last=Kamm | date=2009-03-26 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> and was one of those responsible for establishing its distinctive cryptic style. (The ''Times'' was a relatively late adopter: the ''Telegraph'' crossword started in 1925, and the ''Guardian'' in 1929.) The ''Times'' has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers.  The setter of each puzzle is not identified.  The ''Times'' also has \"jumbo\" (23&times;23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''.\n\n:The daily ''Times'' puzzle is syndicated in the ''New York Post'' (US) and ''The Australian'' (Aus) papers.  In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in ''The Times''.\n\n:In October 2007, [[The Bugle]]&mdash;a TimesOnline podcast by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Andy Zaltzman]]&mdash;introduced the first, revolutionary \"Audio Cryptic Crossword.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-bugle-audio-crossword-dxkd8bfspwk |title= The Bugle Audio Crossword|publisher=The Times UK}}</ref>\n\n;''Viz'' magazine\n:Since 2009 the adult comic magazine ''Viz'' has incorporated a cryptic crossword credited to Anus. This is a collaboration of two setters, one of whom has a minor role in supplying some pre-written clues. In keeping with the comic's \"top shelf\" status the puzzle content is an amalgam of humour and obscenity, although the clueing style retains both Libertarian and Ximenean disciplines.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n;''The Age'' (Australia)\n:(see ''Sydney Morning Herald'')\n\n;''The Atlantic'' (US)\n:''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine had a long-running variety cryptic crossword, known as the Puzzler, created by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon beginning in 1977,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/acrostic/|title= Acrostic Creators|author= Horne, Jim|date= 8 November 2008|work= Wordplay: The Crossword Blog of The New York Times|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2009 }}</ref> available only online since March 2006.

The publication currently features two basic cryptics and two variety cryptics in each issue.  Some other puzzles in the publication include cryptic elements, such as double definition puzzles or hidden word puzzles.\n\n;''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada)\n:\"Canada's national newspaper\" includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins.  The crossword also comes with another set of \"Quick Clues\" (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also used to compile an advanced cryptic in ''The Walrus''.  Once a year on [[Canada Day]], ''The Globe'' published a large 24\u00d724 bar-diagram cryptic, but as of 2015 it no longer does.\n:\n\n'''''The Geraldine News (New Zealand)'''''\n\nThis weekly local paper carries a cryptic once a month. It is compiled by Geraldine resident Jim Walton and titled JW Cryptic Crossword. As at April 2019, Jim had provided 244 cryptic crosswords for the paper.\n\n<br />\n\n;''Harper's'' (US)\n:This magazine features a monthly variety cryptic by [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]], aimed at advanced solvers.\n\n;''The Hindu'' (India)\n:''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper carries cryptic crosswords in the main paper from Monday to Saturday, and a much tougher Sunday Crossword in the Sunday Magazine supplement. The weekday crosswords are set by setters with the pseudonyms Gridman, Arden, Incognito, Afterdark, Buzzer, Neyartha, Scintillator, xChequer, Lightning, Sunnet, Spinner, Aspartame, Mac, Dr. X, KrisKross among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehinducrosswordcorner.blogspot.in/p/thc-setters.html|title=THE HINDU CROSSWORD CORNER: THC Setters|publisher=}}</ref> In every cycle, a setter publishes a certain number of crosswords allotted to him or her, unlike British papers where things are mostly random. The Sunday Crossword is a syndicated crossword from the UK newspaper ''[[The Observer]]''.\n\n:The first setter of the Monday-Saturday cryptic crosswords was Retired Admiral [[Ram Dass Katari]] of the Indian Navy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/10/admiral-katari-hindu-crossword-setter.html|title=Remembering Admiral Katari, the first crossword setter of The Hindu|publisher=}}</ref> who took up the task in 1971 at the request of [[Gopalan Kasturi]], then editor of ''[[The Hindu]]''. The crossword has a regular following, and while ''The Hindu'' publishes the solutions on the following day, the annotated solution is put up on the same day at the website '[http://thehinducrosswordcorner.blogspot.in/ The Hindu Crossword Corner]' by a group of solvers on the same day.\n\n;''Irish Times''\n:The ''Irish Times'' originally provided a daily puzzle by \"[[Crosaire]]\" (Derek Crozier), which featured a fairly unorthodox style of clue-writing. The paper continued to run his puzzles after his death in April 2010. The last of Crozier's crosswords was published in the ''Irish Times'' on 22 October 2011. The ''Irish Times''' cryptic crossword is currently set by Crosaire's successor Crosheir.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gillespie|first=Elgy|title=Carrying the Crosaire|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2011/1022/1224306043431.html|work=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;''The Listener'' (New Zealand)\n:This weekly magazine includes a cryptic by David Tossman, who took over from RWH (Ruth Hendry) in 1997. RWH had been providing a mixed (some cryptic clues) puzzle since 1940.\n\n;''Lovatts Crosswords''\n:Lovatts Crosswords are a range of magazines sold throughout the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and she has been so for 30 years.\n\n;''The Nation'' (US)\n:This liberal American political weekly has featured a weekly cryptic puzzle since 1947. [[Frank W. Lewis]] wrote the puzzle from late 1947 until his retirement in late 2009.  Lewis developed one of the most recognizably personal styles of cryptic setting, and ''The Nation'' published book collections of his puzzles.  Since December 2011, the weekly puzzle has been written by Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto.\n\n;''The National Post'' (Canada)\n:Carries a weekly puzzle by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]].\n\n;''New York Magazine''\n:[[Stephen Sondheim]]'s puzzles for ''[[New York Magazine]]'' have been collected in book form. Sondheim is himself a collector of old-time puzzles and board games.\n\n;''New Yorker''\n:For some of the time that this magazine was edited by Tina Brown (1997\u20131999), it included a small (8\u00d710) barred-grid cryptic crossword, set by a range of American and Canadian setters.  These puzzles are also available in a book collection.\n\n;''New York Times''\n:Two weeks in every 18, the \"variety puzzle\" in the Sunday edition is a cryptic crossword, usually by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]], Richard Silvestri, or Fraser Simpson.  One week in 18, it's a \"Puns and Anagrams\" puzzle, a relic of a 1940s attempt to introduce cryptic puzzles to the US.\n\n;''The New Zealand Herald'' (Auckland New Zealand)\n:The weekend edition features a cryptic crossword by \"Kropotkin\" (Rex Benson) in addition to syndicated crosswords from the UK and Australia.<ref>New Zealand Herald</ref>\n\n;''Ottawa Citizen''\n:The ''Ottawa Citizen'' has carried a weekly puzzle by Susannah Sears since 2001.\n\n;''Sydney Daily Telegraph''\n:Prints the \"Stickler\" puzzle, set by David Stickley.\n\n;''Sydney Morning Herald'' and ''The Age'' (Australia)\n:[[Fairfax Media]] papers, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'', print a daily puzzle, which was also available free on-line until 31 August 2009.

Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the [[United Kingdom]], where they originated,<ref name=Eliot_Brief>{{cite web|last1=Eliot |first1=George |title=Brief History of Crossword Puzzles |url=https://www.crosswordtournament.com/more/wynne.html |publisher=American Crossword Puzzle Tournament}}</ref> [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], and in several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malta]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. In the [[United States]], cryptics are sometimes known as \"British-style\" crosswords. Compilers of cryptic crosswords are commonly called \"setters\" in the [[UK]].\n\nCryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types:  the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and \"themed\" or \"variety\" cryptics, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.\n\n== History and development ==\nCryptic crosswords originated in the UK.  The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. [[Torquemada (crossword compiler)|Torquemada]] (Edward Powys Mathers), who set for ''The Saturday Westminster'' from 1925 and for ''[[The Observer]]'' from 1926 until his death in 1939, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.<ref name=mathers_strange>{{cite web|last1=Millington|first1=Roger|title=The Strange World of the Crossword (excerpt)|url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/mathers.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe first newspaper crosswords appeared in the ''Sunday'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'' from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1925, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' from 1929 and ''[[The Times]]'' from 1930.  These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread.  In some papers this took until about 1960.\n\nPuzzles appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic.\n\nTorquemada's puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter's thought processes.\n\nThe basic principle of fairness was set out by ''Listener'' setter '''Afrit''' ([[Alistair Ferguson Ritchie]]) in his book ''Armchair Crosswords'' (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional ''Book of the Crossword'':\n\n:We must expect the composer to play tricks, but we shall insist that he play fair. The Book of the Crossword lays this injunction upon him: \"You need not mean what you say, but you must say what you mean.\" This is a superior way of saying that he can't have it both ways. He may attempt to mislead by employing a form of words which can be taken in more than one way, and it is your fault if you take it the wrong way, but it is his fault if you can't logically take it the right way.\n\nAn example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:\n:''Hat could be dry (5)''\n\nHere the composer intends the answer to be \"derby\", with \"hat\" the definition, \"could be\" the anagram indicator, and \"be dry\" the anagram fodder. I.e., \"derby\" is an anagram of \"be dry\". But \"be\" is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form \"[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]\" fails: if \"be\" is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator; to be a correct clue it would have to be \"Hat could '''be be''' dry (5)\", which is ungrammatical. A variation might read ''Hat turns out to be dry (5)'', but this also fails because the word \"to\", which is necessary to make the sentence grammatical, follows the indicator (\"turns out\") even though it is not part of the anagram indicated.\n\nTorquemada's successor at ''The Observer'' was '''Ximenes''' ([[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]], 1902\u20131971), and in his influential work, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle'' (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as \"Ximenean principles\" and sometimes described by the word \"square-dealing\".<ref>Reissued Aug 2001: Swallowtail Books {{ISBN|1-903400-04-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-903400-04-3}}</ref> The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes' successor '''[[Azed]]''' ([[Jonathan Crowther]], born 1942):\n\n:A good cryptic clue contains three elements:\n:# a precise definition\n:# a fair subsidiary indication\n:# nothing else\n\nThe Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of \"advanced cryptics\" \u2014 difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' setter '''Araucaria''' ([[John Galbraith Graham]], 1921&ndash;2013) was a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.\n\n== Popularity ==\nMost of the major national [[newspaper]]s in the UK carry both cryptic and concise (quick) crosswords in every issue. The puzzle in ''[[The Guardian]]'' is well loved for its humour and quirkiness, and quite often includes puzzles with themes, which are extremely rare in ''The Times''.<ref>How to master the Times Crossword, Tim Moorey, p. 186</ref>\n\nMany Canadian newspapers, including the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', carry cryptic crosswords.\n\nCryptic crosswords do not commonly appear in U.S. publications, although they can be found in magazines such as ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', and occasionally in the Sunday ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' reprints cryptic crosswords from ''The Times''. In April 2018, [[The New Yorker]] published the first of a new weekly series of cryptic puzzles.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Remnick |first1=David |authorlink1=David Remnick |title=Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle |url=https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Other sources of cryptic crosswords in the U.S. (at various difficulty levels) are puzzle books, as well as UK and Canadian newspapers distributed in the U.S. Other venues include the ''Enigma'', the magazine of the [[National Puzzlers' League]], and formerly, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. The latter puzzle, after a long and distinguished run, appeared solely on ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website for several years, and ended with the October 2009 issue.  A similar puzzle by the same authors now appears monthly in ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/ The Wall Street Journal]''.\n\nCryptic crosswords are very popular in Australia. Most Australian newspapers will have at least one cryptic crossword, if not two. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' in [[Melbourne]] publish daily cryptic crosswords, including Friday's challenging cryptic by 'DA' ([[David Astle]]). \"Lovatts\", an Australian puzzle publisher, regularly issues cryptic crossword puzzle books.\n\n== How cryptic clues work ==\nIn essence, a cryptic clue leads to its answer as long as it is read in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the ''surface reading'') is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with the clue answer.  The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution.\n\nA typical clue consists of two parts, the definition and the wordplay. It provides two ways of getting to the answer. The definition, which usually exactly matches the [[part of speech]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], and [[grammatical number|number]] of the answer, is in essence the same as any 'straight' crossword clue, a synonym for the answer. It usually appears at the start or the end of a clue.\n\nThe other part (the ''subsidiary indication'', or ''wordplay'') provides an alternative route to the answer (this part would be a second definition in the case of double definition clues). One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between definition and wordplay and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue ''cryptically''. This wordplay gives the solver some instructions on how to get to the answer another way. (Sometimes the two parts are joined with a link word or phrase such as \"from\", \"gives\" or \"could be\".)\n\nThere are many sorts of wordplay, such as anagrams and double definitions, but they all conform to rules. The crossword setters do their best to stick to these rules when writing their clues, and solvers can use these rules and conventions to help them solve the clues. Noted cryptic setter [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]] (who wrote cryptics under the pseudonym of Ximenes) discusses the importance and art of fair cluemanship in his seminal book on cryptic crosswords, ''Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword'' (1966, reprinted 2001).<ref>{{cite book |last=Macnutt |first=Derrick |title=Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword  |year=2001 |publisher=Swallowtail Books |location=London |isbn=1-903400-04-X |pages=42\u201353}}</ref>\n\nBecause a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. The clues are 'self-checking'. This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.\n\nHere is an example (taken from ''[[The Guardian]]'' crossword of 6 August 2002, set by \"Shed\").\n\n:15D ''Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)''\n\nis a clue for <small>TRAGICAL</small>.  This breaks down as follows.\n*15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid\n*\"Very sad\" is the definition\n*\"unfinished story\" gives \"tal\" (\"tale\" with one letter missing; i.e., unfinished)\n*\"rising smoke\" gives \"ragic\" (a \"cigar\" is a smoke and this is a down clue so \"rising\" indicates that \"cigar\" should be written up the page; i.e., backwards)\n*\"about\" means that the letters of \"tal\" should be put either side of \"ragic\", giving \"tragical\"\n*\"(8)\" says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.\n\nThere are many \"code words\" or \"indicators\" that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, \"about\", \"unfinished\" and \"rising\" all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.\n\n[[#Compilers|Compilers]] or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these is important for the solver. Abbreviations may be as simple as 'west' = W, 'New York' = NY, but may also be more difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crossword365.com/pages/cryptic-abbreviations |title=Cryptic crossword abbreviations |accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> Words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited; often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:\n\n* Bloomer - often means flower (a thing that blooms).\n* Flower - often means river (a thing that flows).\n* Lead - could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.\n* Nice - if capitalized as the first word, could either be \"amiable\" or the French city.  Thus \"Nice friend\" often means the letters ''ami''.\n* Novel - could be a book, or a word for new, or a code-word indicating an anagram.\n* Permit - could be a noun (meaning license) or a verb (meaning allow).\n\nOf these examples, \"flower\" is an invented meaning by back-formation from the -er suffix, which cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary.  A similar trick is played in the old clue \"A wicked thing\" for CANDLE, where the -ed suffix must be understood in its \"equipped with a ...\" meaning.  In the case of the -er suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for river \u2192 BANKER (a river is not a 'thing that banks' but a 'thing that has banks'), this is rarely done.\n\nSometimes \"compiler\", or the name or codename of the compiler (if visible by the crossword), codes for some form of the pronoun \"I, me, my, mine\".\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' back page, Monday 15 March 2017, 7 down, is \"Banish spirits with zero ice upsetting imbibing times (8)\"; the answer is <small>EXORCIZE</small>: it means \"banish spirits\", and is \"zero ice\" rearranged, including 'x' (described as \"times\").\n\n== Grids for cryptic crosswords ==\n[[File:British crossword.svg|thumb|A lattice-style grid common for cryptic crosswords]]\n\nA typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15\u00d715, with half-turn [[rotational symmetry]].  Unlike typical American [[crosswords]], in which every square is almost always ''checked'' (that is, each square provides a letter for both an across and a down answer), only about half of the squares in a cryptic crossword are checked.\n\nIn most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids.  In the past this was because [[hot metal typesetting]] meant that new grids were expensive.<ref>{{cite news\n|last=Tossman\n|first=David\n|title=Crossword 847 answers and explanations\n|date=23 November 2013\n|url=https://www.listener.co.nz/entertainment/cryptic-crosswords/crossword-847-answers-and-explanations/\n|newspaper=[[New Zealand Listener]]\n}}</ref>\n\nSome papers have additional grid rules. In ''[[The Times]]'', for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word.  The grid shown here breaks one ''Times'' grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15.  ''[[The Independent]]'' allows setters to use their own grid designs.\n\nVariety (UK: \"advanced\") cryptic crosswords typically use a \"barred grid\" with no black squares and a slightly smaller size; 12&times;12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called \"bars\".  In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; unclued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved.  The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.\n\nA July 2006 \"Puzzlecraft\" section in [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]] on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword.  In most UK \"advanced cryptics\" ('variety cryptic'), at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.\n\n== Regional variation ==\n\n=== British and North American differences ===\nThere are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one; e.g., a ''triple definition'' clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.\n\n=== Other languages ===\nFor the most part, cryptic crosswords are an [[English-language]] phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form in [[Israel]] (where they are called ''tashbetsey higayon'' (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df) \"Logic crosswords\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuckermann.org/cryptic.html|title=One of Dr Ghil`ad Zuckermann's Cryptic Crosswords|publisher=}}</ref> and (as ''Cryptogram'')  in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In Poland similar crosswords are called \"[[Hetman]] crosswords\". 'Hetman', a senior commander, and also the name for a [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[Chess]], emphasises their importance over other crosswords. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], this type of crossword puzzle is known as ''piilosana'' (literally \"hidden word\"), while ''krypto'' refers to a crossword puzzle where the letters have been coded as numbers. The [[Germany|German]] ''ZEITmagazin'' has a weekly cryptic crossword called ''Um die Ecke gedacht'' and the ''SZ Magazin'' features ''das Kreuz mit den Worten''.\n\nIn India the [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] publication [[Sakshi (newspaper)|Sakshi]] carries a \"Tenglish\" (Telugu-English, bilingual) cryptic crossword;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/09/how-kishore-solved-tenglish-crossword.html|title=Tenglish crossword|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 29 September 2012.}}</ref> the [[Prajavani]] and [[Vijaya Karnataka]] crossword ([[Kannada Language|Kannada]]) also employs cryptic wordplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/08/kannada-crosswords.html|title=Kannada crosswords: Prajavani, Udayavani, Kannada Prabha|publisher=Crossword Unclued, 22 August 2012.}}</ref> Enthusiasts have also created cryptic crosswords in Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2014/08/prize-hindi-puzzle-winner.html|title=Prize Hindi Puzzle: Here's Our Winner|publisher=}}</ref> Since 1994, ''enigmista'' [[w:it:Ennio Peres|Ennio Peres]] has challenged Italians annually with ''[http://www.parole.tv/xw/cruciperes.asp Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo]'' (The World's Most Difficult Crossword), which has many features in common with English-style cryptics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/07/22/il-cruciverba-piu-difficile-del-mondo/1893519/|title=Il cruciverba pi\u00f9 difficile del mondo|author=Dario De Toffoli|work=Il Fatto Quotidiano}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese something similar is the [[riddle]] of Chinese characters, where partial characters instead of substrings are clued and combined.\n\n== Types of cryptic clues ==\nClues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay.  Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it: one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved.  In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of [[#\"& lit.\"|\"& lit.\"]] clues.  Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word: \"cryptic crossword\" would be clued with \"(7,9)\" following the clue.  More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.\n\n=== Anagrams ===\n[[File:Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT.gif|thumb|Animation for the anagram CORSET = ESCORT]]\nAn [[anagram]] is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by words such as \"strange\", \"bizarre\", \"muddled\", \"wild\", \"drunk\", or any other term indicating change. One example:\n\n:''Chaperone shredded corset (6)''\n\ngives <small>ESCORT</small>, which means ''chaperone'' and is an anagram of ''corset'', indicated by the word ''shredded''.\n\nAnagram clues are characterized by an indicator word adjacent to a phrase that has the same number of letters as the answer. The indicator tells the solver that there is an [[anagram]] they need to solve to work out the answer. Indicators come either before or after the letters to be anagrammed. In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and ''then'' anagrammed. So in this clue:\n\n:''Chew honeydew fruit (5)''\n\n''Chew'' is the anagram indicator; ''honeydew'' clues ''melon'', which is to be anagrammed; and ''fruit'' is the definition for the answer, <small>LEMON</small>.  This kind of clue is called an ''indirect anagram'', which in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords are not used, ever since they were criticised by 'Ximenes' in his 1966 book ''On the Art of the Crossword''.  Minor exception: simple abbreviations may be used to spice up the process; e.g., \"Husband, a most eccentric fellow\" (6) for THOMAS, where the anagram is made from A, MOST, and H = husband.\n\nAnagram indicators, among the thousands possible, include: about, abstract, absurd, adapted, adjusted, again, alien, alternative, anew, another, around, arranged, assembled, assorted, at sea, awful, awkward, bad, barmy, becomes, blend, blow, break, brew, build, careless, changed, chaotic, characters, clumsy, composed, confused, contrived, convert, cooked, corrupt, could be, crazy, damaged, dancing, designed, develop, different, disorderly, disturbed, doctor, eccentric, edited, engineer, fabricate, fake, fancy, faulty, fiddled, fix, foolish, form, free, fudge, gives, ground, hammer, haywire, hybrid, improper, in a tizzy, involved, irregular, jostle, jumbled, jumping, kind of, knead, letters, loose, made, managed, maybe, messy, mistaken, mix, modified, moving, muddled, mutant, new, novel, odd, off, order, organised, otherwise, out, outrageous, peculiar, perhaps, playing, poor, possible, prepared, produced, queer, questionable, random, reform, remodel, repair, resort, rough, shaken, shifting, silly, sloppy, smashed, somehow, sort, spoilt, strange, style, switch, tangled, treated, tricky, troubled, turning, twist, unconventional, undone, unsettled, unsound, untidy, unusual, upset, used, vary, version, warped, wayward, weird, wild, working, wrecked, wrong.\n\nIt is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of anagram indicator and anagram that form a common phrase to make the clue appear as much like a 'normal' sentence or phrase as possible.  For example:\n\n:''Lap dancing friend (3)''\n\nuses ''dancing'' as the indicator as it fits cohesively with ''lap'' to give the solution, <small>PAL</small>.\n\n=== Charade ===\nHere, the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).\n\nFor example:\n\n:''Outlaw leader managing money (7)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BANKING</small> formed by <small>BAN</small> for \"outlaw\" and <small>KING</small> for \"leader\". The definition is \"managing money\". With this example, the words appear in the same order in the clue as they do in the answer, and no special words are needed to indicate this. However, the order of the parts is sometimes indicated with words such as \"against\", \"after\", \"on\", \"with\" or \"above\" (in a down clue).\n\n=== Containers ===\nA container clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:\n\n:''Apostle's friend outside of university (4)''\n\ngives <small>PAUL</small> (\"apostle\"), by placing \"pal\" (\"friend\") outside of \"U\" (\"university\"); the \"'s\" could be treated as the [[genitive]] case suffix or as short for \"is\".\n\nA similar example:\n\n:''Utter nothing when there's wickedness about (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>VOICE</small> (\"utter\"), formed by placing \"O\" (\"nothing\") inside the word \"vice\" (\"wickedness\").\n\nOther container indicators are \"inside\", \"over\", \"around\", \"about\", \"clutching\", \"enters\", and the like.\n\n=== Deletions ===\nDeletions consist of ''beheadments'', ''curtailments'', and ''internal deletions''.  In beheadments, a word loses its first letter.  In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.\n\nAn example of a beheadment:\n\n:''Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>TAR</small>, another word for \"sailor\", which is a \"celebrity\", or star, without the first letter.\n\nOther indicator words of beheadment include \"don't start\", \"topless\", and \"after the first\".\n\nAn example of curtailment:\n\n:''Shout, \"Read!\" endlessly (3)''\n\nThe answer is <small>BOO</small>.  If you ignore the punctuation, a book is a \"read\", and book \"endlessly\" is ''boo'', a \"shout\".\n\nOther indicators include \"nearly\" and \"unfinished\".\n\nAn example of internal deletion:\n\n:''Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)''\n\nThe answer is <small>DARING</small>, which means \"challenging\", and is darling without its middle letter, or \"heartlessly\".\n\nNote that \"sweetheart\" could also be simply \"wee\" or the letter \"E\", that is, the \"heart\" (middle) of \"sweet\".\n\n=== Double definition ===\nA clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:\n\n: ''Not seeing window covering (5)''\n\nwould have the answer <small>BLIND</small>, because ''blind'' can mean both \"not seeing\" and \"window covering\". Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:\n\n: ''Eastern European buff (6)''\n\nThis takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of <small>POLISH</small>, the one with the long \"o\" sound meaning \"someone from Poland\" and the one with the short \"o\" sound meaning \"make shiny\".\n\nThese clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.\n\nIn the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used; e.g.:\n\n: ''Blue swallow feathers fell from above (4)''\n\nis a quintuple definition of <small>DOWN</small> (\"blue\" (sad), \"swallow\" (drink), \"feathers\" (plumage), \"fell\" (cut down) and \"from above\"),<ref>Arachne (30 January 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26170 Cryptic crossword No 26,170], ''The Guardian''</ref> but in the US this would be considered unsound.\n\nSome British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:\n\n: ''Let in or let on (5)'' \u2013 <small>ADMIT</small>\n\nNote that these clues do not have clear indicator words.\n\n=== Hidden words ===\nWhen the answer appears in the clue but is contained within one or more words, it is hidden.  For example:\n\n:''Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)''\n\ngives <small>UNDERMINED</small>, which means (cryptically at least) \"damaged\" and can be found as part of \"Fo'''und ermine d'''eer\". The word \"hides\" is used to mean \"contains,\" but in the surface sense suggests \"pelts\". A complication is that \"damaged\" often (but not in this clue) means \"rearrange the letters\".\n\nPossible indicators of a hidden clue are \"in part\", \"partially\", \"in\", \"within\", \"hides\", \"conceals\", \"some\", and \"held by\".\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)''\n\ngives <small>DOG</small>, which is the first part of, or \"introduction to\", the word \"do-gooder\", and means \"canine\".\nHidden words clues are sometimes called \"Embedded words\" or \"Telescopic clues\". The opposite of a hidden word clue, where letters ''missing'' from a sentence have to be found, is known as a [[Printer's Devilry]], and appears in some advanced cryptics.\n\nThere are several common techniques used in Hidden Word clues.\n\n==== Initial letters ====\nThe first letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.\n\nAn example of an initialism:\n\n:''Initially amiable person eats primate (3)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>APE</small>, which is a type of primate. \"Initially\" signals that you must take the first letters of \"'''a'''miable '''p'''erson '''e'''ats\" \u2013 \"ape\".\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n:''At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)''\n\nThe answer would be [[Annie (musical)|<small>ANNIE</small>]], the name of a famous orphan in musical theatre. This is obtained from the first letters of \"actor needing new identity emulates\".\n\nWords that indicate initialisms also include \"firstly\" and \"to start\".\n\nIt is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue.  It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:\n\n:''Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>DAHOMEY</small>, which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an \"old country\"). Here, we take the first letters of only the words \"Head Office\" (ho) and we take the \"end\" of the word \"day\" (y). The letters of the word \"dame\", meaning \"lady\", are then made to go around the letters \"ho\" to form Dahomey.\n\n==== Odd/even letters ====\nEither the odd or even letters of words in the clue give the answer. An example is:\n\n:''Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)''\n\nThe answer would be <small>SUFFRAGIST</small>, which is \"someone wanting women to vote\". The word \"odd\" indicates that we must take every other letter of the rest of the clue, starting with the first: StUfF oF mR wAuGh Is SeT.\n\n=== Homophones ===\n[[Homophone]]s are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as \"night\" and \"knight\".  Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with phonetics, such as \"reportedly\", \"they say\", \"utterly\" (here treated as \"utter(ing)-ly\" and not with its usual meaning), \"vocal\", \"to the audience\", \"auditioned\", \"by the sound of it\", \"is heard\", \"in conversation\" and \"on the radio\". \"Broadcast\" is a particularly devious indicator as it could indicate either a homophone or an anagram.\n\nAn example of a homophone clue is\n\n:''We hear twins shave (4)''\n\nwhich is a clue for <small>PARE</small>, which means \"shave\" and is a homophone of pair, or \"twins\".  The homophone is indicated by \"we hear\".\n\nIf the two words are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the homophone indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, \"we hear\" was adjacent to \"twins\" and the answer was ''pare'' rather than ''pair''. The indicator could come between the words if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of \"right\" and \"rite\".\n\n=== Letter Banks ===\nThe letter bank form of cluing consists of a shorter word (or words) containing no repeated letters (an \"isogram\"), and a longer word or phrase built by using each of these letters (but no others) at least once but repeating them as often as necessary. This type of clue has been described by American constructors Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto, who write the weekly puzzle for The Nation. The shorter word is typically at least three or four letters in length, while the target word or phrase is at least three letters longer than the bank word. For example, the four letters in the word TENS can be used as a bank to form the word TENNESSEE. Typically, the clue contains indicator words such as \"use,\" \"take,\" or \"implement\" to signal that a letter bank is being employed.\n\nA more complicated example of a letter bank is:\n\n: ''Composer taking and retaking ingredients of Advil? Not! (7,7)''\n\nIn this case, \"ingredients\" signals that the letters of both \"Advil\" and \"Not\" form the bank. Those letters yield the answer, ANTONIO VIVALDI. \n\nKosman and Picciotto consider this to be a newer and more complicated form of cluing that offers another way, besides the anagram, of mixing and recombining letters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/going-bank/|title=Going to the Bank {{!}} The Nation|last=Picciotto|first=Joshua Kosman and Henri|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\n=== Reversals ===\nA word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:\n\n:''Returned beer fit for a king (5)''\n\nThe answer is <small>REGAL</small>. \"Lager\" (i.e., \"beer\") is \"returned\" to make ''regal,'' i.e. fit for a king.\n\nOther indicator words include \"receding\", \"in the mirror\", \"going the wrong way\", \"returns\", \"reverses\" \"to the left\" or \"left\" (for across clues), and \"rising\", \"overturned\" or \"mounted\" or \"comes up\" (for down clues).\n\n=== Cryptic definition ===\nHere the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another.  For example:\n\n:''Flower of London?'' (6)\n\ngives <small>THAMES</small>, a flow-er of London.  Here, the surface reading suggests a blossom, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required. Notice the question mark: this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion.  The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its ''surface reading'' and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue's component words.\n\nThis type of clue is common in British and Canadian cryptics but is a bit less common in American cryptics; in American-style crosswords, a clue like this is generally called a punny clue. It's almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.\n\n=== Spoonerism ===\nA relatively uncommon clue type, a [[Spoonerism]] is a play on words where corresponding [[consonant cluster]]s are switched between two words in a phrase (or syllables in a word) and the switch forms another pair of proper ''sounding'' words. For example: \"butterfly\" = \"flutter by\".\n\nBoth the solution word or phrase and its corresponding Spoonerism are clued for, and the clue type is almost always indicated by reference to Spooner himself \u2013 with some regions/publications insisting his religious title \"Rev.\" or \"Reverend\" be included. In contrast to all other clue types, this makes them almost impossible to disguise. But that doesn't necessarily make them easy.\n\nAn example of a Spoonerism clue is:\n\n:''He will casually put down Spooner's angry bear (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>LITTERBUG</small> (''He will casually put down''). The Spoonerism is \"bitter\" (''angry'') and \"lug\" (''bear, as in carry'').\n\nThe vast majority of Spoonerism clues swap the first consonants of words or syllables, but Spoonerisms are not strictly restricted to that form and some setters will take advantage of this. John Henderson (Enigmatist in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]) once clued for the Spoonerism \"light crick\" from \"right click\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=John|title=(Enigmatist)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25930|work=Cryptic crossword No 25,930|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|date=24 April 2013}}</ref> which didn't sit well with many solvers.\n\n=== \"&lit.\" ===\nAn \"&lit.\" or \"Literal\" clue is not a clue type, but, rather a variant on an existing clue. \"&lit\" stands for \"and literally so\". In this case, the entire clue is both a definition and a cryptic clue. In some publications &lit clues are indicated by an [[exclamation mark]] at the end of the clue.  For example:\n\n:''God incarnate, essentially! (4)''\n\nThe answer is <small>ODIN</small>. The Norse god [[Odin]] is hidden in \"g'''od in'''carnate\", as clued by \"essentially\", but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.\n\nThis satisfies the \"& lit.\" clue definition but as read is clearly a cryptic clue.  Another example:\n\n:''Spoil vote! (4)''\n\nwould give the answer <small>VETO</small>; in the cryptic sense, ''spoil'' works as an [[anagram]] indicator for ''vote'', while the whole clue is, with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters, a definition.\n\nAnother example:\n\n:''e.g., Origin of goose (3)''\n\ngives the answer <small>EGG</small>. Geese find their origins in eggs, so the whole clue gives \"egg\", but the clue can also be broken down: e.g., loses its full stops to give ''eg'', followed by the first letter (i.e., the \"origin\") of the word goose\u2014''g''\u2014to make ''egg''.\n\n''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Tuesday 22 April 2014 has: \"Dog in wild? Yes! (5)\"; the answer is <small>[[dingo|DINGO]]</small>. \"Dog in wild\" means \"rearrange the letters of \"<small>DOG IN</small>\", '''and''' is the definition.\n\n== Clueing techniques ==\n\n=== Combination clues ===\nIt is very common for a clue to employ more than one method of wordplay.  For example:\n\n:''Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)''\n\nThe answer is <small>HONORABLE</small>.  \"Baron\" \"returns\", or is reversed, and put inside \"pit\" or hole, to make ''honorable'', or \"illustrious\".\n\nIn this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types:\n\n:''Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6)''\n\nThe answer to this clue is <small>ROTTEN</small>. The phrase \"to turn\" indicates \"to reverse,\" and \"part of\" suggests a piece of \"Internet torrid\".\n\n=== Misleading clues ===\n\nTo make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner.\n\n*A cryptic crossword on the back page of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' on 14 March 2012 included the answer <small>ANALYSIS</small>, whose clue was \"Close study of broken '''nails''', '''say''' (8)\": \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is part of an anagram.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' back page, 8 November 2012: \"Drunk compiler's admitted boob (5)\" means \"Means 'drunk', <small>MY</small> contains <small>ERR</small>, has 5 letters\", = <small>MERRY</small>. (\"Drunk\" often mean \"rearrange the letters\", but not this time.)\n* In a crossword by ''[[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]]'', \"Araucaria is\" coded for <small>IAM</small> (= \"I am\") as part of an answer.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 25 February 2014: \"French place in island beset by cold sadly\": \"sadly\" usually means \"damaged\", \"with the letters rearranged\", but here it codes for \"alas\"; <small>I</small> inside <small>C ALAS</small> makes <small>CALAIS</small>, which is a French place.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 3 April 2014: \"Bug starts to '''m'''ove '''i'''n '''d'''ark, '''g'''lowing '''e'''ndlessly (5)\": usually \"endlessly\" and similar mean \"remove the last letter\", but here it is one of five consecutive words to form an [[acronym]] from, as the word \"starts\" shows; the answer is <small>MIDGE</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 18, 1 September 2015: 4 down: \"How one may find Etna to increase danger? (2,3,4)\": the answer (<small>UP THE ANTE</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>ETNA</small>, which is the reverse of usual.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 27 March 2017: 10 down: \"One might see flow in this game (8)\":  the answer (<small>WILDFOWL</small>) describes how to make the clue word <small>FLOW</small>, which is the reverse of usual; \"game\" is as in sport shooting.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 16, 2 May 2017: 1 across: \"Schoolchild's punishment, devising a cryptic clue for 'crows'? (7,5)\": the answer is <small>HUNDRED LINES</small>: reverse of the usual way to use a Roman number.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 32, 14 November 2017: 28 across: \"Very old diamonds, say (5)\": <small>V O ICE</small>: \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is the definition; the word \"voice\" can be used as a verb.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 34, 22 March 2018: 3 down: \"Trouble from win<u>d is turb</u>ulent\": answer is <small>DISTURB</small>; the word \"turbulent\" suggests forming an anagram, which does not happen here.\n* A clue in the ''Daily Telegraph'' September 2018 started \"Communist leader\", which would be expected to mean the letter C; but this time it was the definition, and the answer was <small>CHE GUEVARA</small>.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 3 June 2019: 20 down: \"Discover the truth about \\ gang fight in New York City\": both parts are definitions of \"[[wikt:rumble|<small>RUMBLE</small>]]\" :: in a British newspaper, although \"rumble\" for \"gang fight\" is American [[street gang]] jargon.\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' page 30, 21 June 2019: 12 across: \"Greek goddess, flanked by banks of [[Tigris]] in ancient city (6)\": The Greek goddess is [[Hebe (mythology)|<small>HEBE</small>]], not one much known of; between the first and last letters of <small>TIGRIS</small>, makes [[Thebes, Greece|<small>THEBES</small>]]; \"ancient city\" usually means [[Ur|<small>UR</small>]], but not here.\n\n=== Clues valid only on particular days or in particular areas ===\n* A cryptic crossword in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' on [[Easter Sunday]] 2014 had an anagram clue whose answer was <small>EASTER SUNDAY</small>, and its definition part was \"today\".\n* ''Daily Telegraph'' on 8 April 2019, page 30: 5 down: \"Parade one month ago (5,4)\": its answer was <small>MARCH PAST</small>; that clue would be valid only in April each year.\n* In a cryptic crossword in the British newspaper ''Daily Telegraph'' (20 April 2017), the clue \"''Irritating proverb we're told (4)'' (<small>SORE</small> = \"[[wikt:saw#Etymology 2|saw]]\") depends on a [[homophony]] which only happens in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation such as in British English.\n\n== Bits and pieces ==\nAbbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for cluing individual letters or short sections of the answer. Consider this clue:\n\n''About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)''\n\n:There are two abbreviations used here.  \"About\" is abbreviated \"c\" (for \"circa\"), and \"little Desmond\" indicates that the [[diminutive]] of Desmond (namely, DES) is required.  The \"c\" is \"to come between\" DES and ANT (a worker; note that compilers also use \"worker\" to stand for BEE or HAND), giving [[wikt:descant|DESCANT]], which means \"discourse\".\n\nCompilers use many of these [[crossword abbreviations]].\n\nAnother type of abbreviation in clues might be words that refer to letters. For example, 'you' refers to the letter U, 'why' refers to the letter Y, etc. A clue for instance:\n\n:''For example, why didn't you put the country? (5)''\n\n:The answer is \"<small>EGYPT</small>\". Three abbreviations are used here. \"For example\" is abbreviated to the letters E and G (for \"e.g.\"), \"why\" indicates the letter Y. The phrase \"didn't you put\" is the letters P and T (the word \"you\" refers to U, and word \"didn't\" means that the letter U in \"put\" should be left out, making it PT). Adding those letters together gets \"the country\" - EGYPT.\n\nThere are many ways in which constructors can clue a part of a clue. In this clue:\n\n''Exclamation of surprise about spectacles, from the top (3)''\n\n:The word \"spectacles\" clues OO because these letters look like a pair of spectacles \"from the top\". The answer is thus COO, which is an \"exclamation of surprise\" with C coming from \"circa\", clued by \"about\".\n\nOften, Roman numerals are used to break down words into their component letter groups. E.g. In this clue:\n\n''A team's first supporter is pivotal (4)''\n\n:The answer is AXIS, and the direct meaning is conveyed by the words \"is pivotal\". The first A is followed by \"XI\" which is Roman for 11 (refers to the number of players on the field in a cricket or [[soccer]] team). \"First supporter\" refers to the letter \"S\" which is the first letter of the word \"supporter\".\n\n== Clueing technique and difficulty ==\nCryptic clue styles across newspapers are ostensibly similar, but there are technical differences which result in the work of setters being regarded as either Ximenean or Libertarian (and often a combination of both).\n\nXimenean rules are very precise in terms of grammar and syntax, especially as regards the indicators used for various methods of wordplay. Libertarian setters may use devices which \"more or less\" get the message across. For example, when treating the answer BEER the setter may decide to split the word into BEE and R and, after finding suitable ways to define the answer and BEE, now looks to give the solver a clue to the letter R. Ximenean rules would not allow something like \"reach first\" to indicate that R is the first letter of \"reach\" because, grammatically, that is not what \"reach first\" implies. Instead, a phrase along the lines of \"first to reach\" would be needed as this conforms to rules of grammar. Many Libertarian crossword editors would, however, accept \"reach first\" as it would be considered to reasonably get the idea across. For instance, a clue following Ximenean rules for BEER (BEE + R) may look as such:\n:''Stinger first to reach drink (4)''\nWhile a clue following Libertarian rules may look as follows:\n:''Stinger reaches first drink (4)''\n\n''The Guardian'' is perhaps the most Libertarian of cryptic crosswords, while ''The Times'' is mostly Ximenean. The others tend to be somewhere in between; the ''Financial Times'' and ''Independent'' tend towards Ximenean, the ''Daily Telegraph'' also \u2013 although its Toughie crossword can take a very Libertarian approach depending on the setter.  None of the major daily cryptics in the UK is \"strictly Ximenean\"; all allow clues which are just cryptic definitions, and strict Ximenean rules exclude such clues.  There are other differences like nounal anagram indicators and in current ''Times'' crosswords, unindicated definition by example: \"bay\" in the clue indicating HORSE in the answer, without a qualification like \"bay, perhaps\".\n\nIn terms of difficulty, Libertarian clues can seem impenetrable to inexperienced solvers. However, more significant is the setter him/herself. Crosswords in the ''Times'' and ''Daily Telegraph'' are published anonymously, so the crossword editor ensures that clues adhere to a consistent house style. Inevitably each setter has an individual (and often very recognisable) approach to clue-writing, but the way in which wordplay devices are used and indicated is kept within a defined set of rules.\n\nIn the ''Guardian'', ''Independent'', ''Financial Times'' and ''Telegraph'' Toughie series the setters' pseudonyms are published, so solvers become familiar with the styles of individual setters rather than house rules. Thus the level of difficulty is associated with the setter rather than the newspaper, though puzzles by individual setters can actually vary in difficulty considerably.\n\nIt is effectively impossible, then, to describe one newspaper's crosswords as the toughest or easiest. For newcomers to cryptic puzzles the ''Daily Telegraph'' is often regarded as an ideal starting point, but this is contentious. Since all of the newspapers have different styles, concentrating on one of them is likely to lead to proficiency in only one style of clue-writing; moving to a different series, after perhaps years spent with just one, can leave the solver feeling as if they have gone back to square one. The better technique is to simply attempt as many different crosswords as possible, perhaps to find a \"comfort zone\" but, more importantly, to experience the widest possible range of Ximenean/Libertarian styles.\n\n== Cryptic crosswords in specific publications ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn Britain it is traditional \u2014 dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer [[Edward Powys Mathers|Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers]] (1892\u20131939), who called himself \"Torquemada\" after the Spanish [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisitor]] \u2014 for compilers to use evocative pseudonyms. \"Crispa\", named from the Latin for \"curly-headed\", who set crosswords for the ''Guardian'' from 1954<ref>A Display of Lights (9), Val Gilbert, 2008 - p. 155</ref> until her retirement in 2004, legally changed her surname to \"Crisp\" after divorcing in the 1970s.  Some pseudonyms have obvious connotations: for example, Torquemada as already described, or \"Mephisto\" with fairly obvious devilish overtones.  Others are chosen for logical but less obvious reasons, though \"Dinmutz\" (the late Bert Danher in the ''Financial Times'') was produced by random selection of [[Scrabble]] tiles.\n\n;''The Daily Telegraph/Sunday Telegraph''\n:The ''Telegraph'', like the ''Times'', does not identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the ''Times'', has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters include John Halpern, Ray Terrell, Jeremy Mutch, Don Manley, Allan Smith, Steve Bartlett and Richard Palmer. The regular setters as of 1 November 2006 are shown in a photograph [http://www.crossword.org.uk/valgilbert.htm here]. The crossword editor is Chris Lancaster, who took over from Phil McNeill in early 2018.  There is an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the ''Sunday Telegraph'', and also a 15&times;15 blocked-grid puzzle.\n\n:In September 2008 the ''Telegraph'' started printing a 'Toughie' crossword as well as the daily puzzle, from Tuesday to Friday.  This is described by the paper as \"the toughest crossword in Fleet Street\" or similar and does include the setter's pseudonym.  Comments from some solvers on these puzzles don't always agree with this assessment, rating maybe half of them as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty.\n\n;''The Guardian''\n:Notable compilers of ''[[The Guardian]]'''s cryptic crosswords include Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul (John Halpern again), Rufus (now retired), and the late [[Bob Smithies]] (Bunthorne) and [[Araucaria (compiler)|Araucaria]].  The puzzle is edited by Hugh Stephenson.\n\n;''The Independent''\n:''The Independent'' went online only in 2016, but still has a cryptic crossword. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Anax, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk ([[John Halpern]]).  The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson).\n\n;''i''\n:The ''i'' newspaper was launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent, but was bought by Johnston Press in February 2016 when The Independent moved to digital-only publication. The fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by John Henderson whose predecessor was the late former ''Times'' crossword editor Mike Laws. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina: a hidden feature. \n\n;''The National''\n:Launched in Scotland as \"The Newspaper that supports an independent Scotland\" on 24 November 2014 after the independence referendum on 18 September. The National has a daily cryptic crossword after a request from readers to include one. The National is the only daily pro-independence newspaper in Scotland and is edited by Sunday Herald editor Richard Walker.\n\n;''The Observer''\n:Home of the famous [[Azed]] crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics, and in conjunction with its predecessors 'Torquemada' and 'Ximenes' is the longest-running series of barred-grid puzzles. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today's top compilers have learnt their trade. ''The Observer'' also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.\n\n;''Private Eye''\n:In the early 1970s the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' had a crossword set by the Labour MP [[Tom Driberg]], under the pseudonym of \"Tiresias\" (supposedly \"a distinguished academic churchman\"). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name \"Cyclops\". This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqu\u00e9 to rude, in clues, answers and the solver's head; much of the rudeness is by innuendo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example, the current monarch of the UK is \"Brenda\" and the likely next one \"Prince Brian\".  The \u00a3100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n;''The Radio Times''\n:Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.\n\n;''Significance''\n:[[Significance (magazine)|''Significance'']] is a joint publication between the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society; it contains a cryptic crossword in its puzzle section.  The magazine offers a randomly awarded $150 or \u00a3100 to spend on [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] books for those that submit a correct entry.\n\n;''The Spectator''\n:Cryptics in the weekly ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event that has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the ''Spectator'' is numbered: in the ''Spectator'''s case, a puzzle's theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event that occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for 'Pseudonym') and Columba.\n\n;''The Sunday Times''\n:''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cryptic crossword is compiled in rotation by three setters: Jeff Pearce, Dean Mayer and David McLean, the latter taking over from Tim Moorey in January 2016. (Mr Moorey's final puzzle included the hidden message 'Farewell from Tim'; he continues to set Mephisto puzzles.) The position of puzzles editor is now held by Peter Biddlecombe. Until her retirement in December 2010, Barbara Hall was puzzles editor for 32 years, and wrote about half the paper's cryptic crosswords. The ''Sunday Times'' is also home to the difficult barred-grid Mephisto puzzle, currently set in rotation by Don Manley, Paul McKenna and Tim Moorey. Previous Mephisto setters were Richard Kilner (only setter, 1959 to 1973), Richard Whitelegg (only setter, 1973 to 1995), Chris Feetenby (1995-2008) and Mike Laws (1995-2011).<ref>The Sunday Times Mephisto Crossword Book 1, 2003 - Introduction</ref>\n\n;''The Times''\n:[[Adrian Bell]] was the first to set [[The Times|The ''Times'']] crossword from 1930<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/article5976721.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The Times crossword the man who began it all | first=Oliver | last=Kamm | date=2009-03-26 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> and was one of those responsible for establishing its distinctive cryptic style. (The ''Times'' was a relatively late adopter: the ''Telegraph'' crossword started in 1925, and the ''Guardian'' in 1929.) The ''Times'' has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers.  The setter of each puzzle is not identified.  The ''Times'' also has \"jumbo\" (23&times;23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''.\n\n:The daily ''Times'' puzzle is syndicated in the ''New York Post'' (US) and ''The Australian'' (Aus) papers.  In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in ''The Times''.\n\n:In October 2007, [[The Bugle]]&mdash;a TimesOnline podcast by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Andy Zaltzman]]&mdash;introduced the first, revolutionary \"Audio Cryptic Crossword.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-bugle-audio-crossword-dxkd8bfspwk |title= The Bugle Audio Crossword|publisher=The Times UK}}</ref>\n\n;''Viz'' magazine\n:Since 2009 the adult comic magazine ''Viz'' has incorporated a cryptic crossword credited to Anus. This is a collaboration of two setters, one of whom has a minor role in supplying some pre-written clues. In keeping with the comic's \"top shelf\" status the puzzle content is an amalgam of humour and obscenity, although the clueing style retains both Libertarian and Ximenean disciplines.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n;''The Age'' (Australia)\n:(see ''Sydney Morning Herald'')\n\n;''The Atlantic'' (US)\n:''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine had a long-running variety cryptic crossword, known as the Puzzler, created by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon beginning in 1977,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/acrostic/|title= Acrostic Creators|author= Horne, Jim|date= 8 November 2008|work= Wordplay: The Crossword Blog of The New York Times|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2009 }}</ref> available only online since March 2006.

The publication currently features two basic cryptics and two variety cryptics in each issue.  Some other puzzles in the publication include cryptic elements, such as double definition puzzles or hidden word puzzles.\n\n;''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada)\n:\"Canada's national newspaper\" includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins.  The crossword also comes with another set of \"Quick Clues\" (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also used to compile an advanced cryptic in ''The Walrus''.  Once a year on [[Canada Day]], ''The Globe'' published a large 24\u00d724 bar-diagram cryptic, but as of 2015 it no longer does.\n:\n\n'''''The Geraldine News (New Zealand)'''''\n\nThis weekly local paper carries a cryptic once a month. It is compiled by Geraldine resident Jim Walton and titled JW Cryptic Crossword. As at April 2019, Jim had provided 244 cryptic crosswords for the paper.\n\n<br />\n\n;''Harper's'' (US)\n:This magazine features a monthly variety cryptic by [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]], aimed at advanced solvers.\n\n;''The Hindu'' (India)\n:''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper carries cryptic crosswords in the main paper from Monday to Saturday, and a much tougher Sunday Crossword in the Sunday Magazine supplement. The weekday crosswords are set by setters with the pseudonyms Gridman, Arden, Incognito, Afterdark, Buzzer, Neyartha, Scintillator, xChequer, Lightning, Sunnet, Spinner, Aspartame, Mac, Dr. X, KrisKross among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehinducrosswordcorner.blogspot.in/p/thc-setters.html|title=THE HINDU CROSSWORD CORNER: THC Setters|publisher=}}</ref> In every cycle, a setter publishes a certain number of crosswords allotted to him or her, unlike British papers where things are mostly random. The Sunday Crossword is a syndicated crossword from the UK newspaper ''[[The Observer]]''.\n\n:The first setter of the Monday-Saturday cryptic crosswords was Retired Admiral [[Ram Dass Katari]] of the Indian Navy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2012/10/admiral-katari-hindu-crossword-setter.html|title=Remembering Admiral Katari, the first crossword setter of The Hindu|publisher=}}</ref> who took up the task in 1971 at the request of [[Gopalan Kasturi]], then editor of ''[[The Hindu]]''. The crossword has a regular following, and while ''The Hindu'' publishes the solutions on the following day, the annotated solution is put up on the same day at the website '[http://thehinducrosswordcorner.blogspot.in/ The Hindu Crossword Corner]' by a group of solvers on the same day.\n\n;''Irish Times''\n:The ''Irish Times'' originally provided a daily puzzle by \"[[Crosaire]]\" (Derek Crozier), which featured a fairly unorthodox style of clue-writing. The paper continued to run his puzzles after his death in April 2010. The last of Crozier's crosswords was published in the ''Irish Times'' on 22 October 2011. The ''Irish Times''' cryptic crossword is currently set by Crosaire's successor Crosheir.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gillespie|first=Elgy|title=Carrying the Crosaire|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2011/1022/1224306043431.html|work=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;''The Listener'' (New Zealand)\n:This weekly magazine includes a cryptic by David Tossman, who took over from RWH (Ruth Hendry) in 1997. RWH had been providing a mixed (some cryptic clues) puzzle since 1940.\n\n;''Lovatts Crosswords''\n:Lovatts Crosswords are a range of magazines sold throughout the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and she has been so for 30 years.\n\n;''The Nation'' (US)\n:This liberal American political weekly has featured a weekly cryptic puzzle since 1947. [[Frank W. Lewis]] wrote the puzzle from late 1947 until his retirement in late 2009.  Lewis developed one of the most recognizably personal styles of cryptic setting, and ''The Nation'' published book collections of his puzzles.  Since December 2011, the weekly puzzle has been written by Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto.\n\n;''The National Post'' (Canada)\n:Carries a weekly puzzle by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]].\n\n;''New York Magazine''\n:[[Stephen Sondheim]]'s puzzles for ''[[New York Magazine]]'' have been collected in book form. Sondheim is himself a collector of old-time puzzles and board games.\n\n;''New Yorker''\n:For some of the time that this magazine was edited by Tina Brown (1997\u20131999), it included a small (8\u00d710) barred-grid cryptic crossword, set by a range of American and Canadian setters.  These puzzles are also available in a book collection.\n\n;''New York Times''\n:Two weeks in every 18, the \"variety puzzle\" in the Sunday edition is a cryptic crossword, usually by [[Emily Cox (compiler)|Emily Cox]] and [[Henry Rathvon]], Richard Silvestri, or Fraser Simpson.  One week in 18, it's a \"Puns and Anagrams\" puzzle, a relic of a 1940s attempt to introduce cryptic puzzles to the US.\n\n;''The New Zealand Herald'' (Auckland New Zealand)\n:The weekend edition features a cryptic crossword by \"Kropotkin\" (Rex Benson) in addition to syndicated crosswords from the UK and Australia.<ref>New Zealand Herald</ref>\n\n;''Ottawa Citizen''\n:The ''Ottawa Citizen'' has carried a weekly puzzle by Susannah Sears since 2001.\n\n;''Sydney Daily Telegraph''\n:Prints the \"Stickler\" puzzle, set by David Stickley.\n\n;''Sydney Morning Herald'' and ''The Age'' (Australia)\n:[[Fairfax Media]] papers, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'', print a daily puzzle, which was also available free on-line until 31 August 2009. Various compilers (setters) compose the puzzles, each being indicated by their initials. As of November 2013, compilers from Monday to Saturday include LR (Liam Runnalls), RM (Rose McGinley), DP (David Plomley), DH (Donald Harrison), NS (Nancy Sibtain), DA ([[David Astle]]), and DS (David Sutton).\n\n;''The Toronto Star'' (Canada)\n:Includes a cryptic crossword in the Saturday edition in the Puzzles section from the Sunday Times.

This STEM connection increases significantly with level of expertise, particularly for mathematics and IT. The authors suggest that cryptic crossword skill is bound up with code-cracking and problem-solving skills of a logical and quasi-algebraic nature.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://createpsy.com/2016/12/19/cryptic-crossword-expertise/|title=What makes an expert cryptic crossword solver?|date=2016-12-19|work=CREATE \u03a8|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFriedlander and Fine also note that solvers are motivated predominantly by [[Eureka effect|\"Aha!\" moments]], and intrinsic rewards such as mental challenge.

However, despite the fact he was promised a future position as the Pakistan Army Chief, he was unconvinced. When the Baluch Regiment was allotted to Pakistan, Usman was transferred to the [[Dogra Regiment]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947===\nIn 1947 Pakistan sent tribal irregulars into the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in an attempt to capture it and accede it to Pakistan. Usman, then commanding the 77th Parachute Brigade, was sent to command  the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]], which was deployed at Jhangar in December 1947.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/> On 25 December 1947, with the odds stacked heavily against the brigade, Pakistani forces captured Jhangar. Located at the junction of roads coming from [[New Mirpur City|Mirpur]] and [[Kotli]], Jhangar was of strategic importance. On that day Usman took a vow to recapture Jhangar \u2013 a feat he accomplished three months later, but at the cost of his own life.<ref name=\"Academy\">\n[http://nausheraacademy.com/battle+of+naushera.html About Battle of Naushera], Naushera Defence Academy, retrieved 23 March 2019.\n</ref>\n\nIn January\u2013February 1948 Usman repulsed fierce attacks on [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Nowshera]] and Jhangar, both highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir. During the defence of Nowshera against overwhelming odds and numbers, Indian forces inflicted around 2000 casualties on the Pakistanis (about 1000 dead and 1000 wounded) while Indian forces suffered only 33 dead and 102 wounded. His defence earned him the nickname '''Lion of Nowshera'''.<ref>\"Saluting the Brave\", [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]](India), 6 July 2006.</ref> Pakistani forces then announced a sum of Rs 50,000 as a prize for his head. Unaffected by praise and congratulations, Usman continued to sleep on a mat laid on the floor as he had vowed that he would not sleep on a bed till he recaptured Jhangar, from where he had had to withdraw in late 1947.<ref name=\"Academy\"/>\n\nThe then [[Lieutenant General]] [[Kodandera M. Cariappa|K M Cariappa]] (later [[General]] and Chief of Army Staff and years after retirement made [[Field Marshal (India)|Field Marshal]]), who had taken over as Western Army Commander, brought his tactical headquarters forward to [[Jammu]] to oversee the conduct of two important operations, namely the capture of Jhangar and [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]]. The operations commenced in the last week of February 1948. The 19th Infantry Brigade advanced along the northern ridge, while the 50th Parachute Brigade cleared the hills dominating the Nowshera-Jhangar road in the south.\n\nThe enemy was eventually driven from the area, and Jhangar was recaptured. Pakistan brought its regular forces into the fray in May 1948. Jhangar was once again subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, and  many determined attacks were launched on Jhangar by the Pakistan Army. However, Usman frustrated all their attempts to recapture it. It was during this defence of Jhangar that Usman was killed on 3 July 1948, by an enemy 25-pounder shell. He was 12 days short of his 36th birthday. His last words were \"I am dying but let not the territory we were fighting for fall for the enemy\". For his inspiring leadership and great courage, he was awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/heroes.htm |title=Citation on Brig.

By April 1944, he was a temporary [[Major]].<ref>\nApril 1944 Indian Army List\n</ref> He served in [[Burma]] and was [[mentioned in dispatches]] as a temporary Major in the London Gazette 27 September 1945.

However, despite the fact he was promised a future position as the Pakistan Army Chief, he was unconvinced. When the Baluch Regiment was allotted to Pakistan, Usman was transferred to the [[Dogra Regiment]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947===\nIn 1947 Pakistan sent tribal irregulars into the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in an attempt to capture it and accede it to Pakistan. Usman, then commanding the 77th Parachute Brigade, was sent to command  the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]], which was deployed at Jhangar in December 1947.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/> On 25 December 1947, with the odds stacked heavily against the brigade, Pakistani forces captured Jhangar. Located at the junction of roads coming from [[New Mirpur City|Mirpur]] and [[Kotli]], Jhangar was of strategic importance. On that day Usman took a vow to recapture Jhangar \u2013 a feat he accomplished three months later, but at the cost of his own life.<ref name=\"Academy\">\n[http://nausheraacademy.com/battle+of+naushera.html About Battle of Naushera], Naushera Defence Academy, retrieved 23 March 2019.\n</ref>\n\nIn January\u2013February 1948 Usman repulsed fierce attacks on [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Nowshera]] and Jhangar, both highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir. During the defence of Nowshera against overwhelming odds and numbers, Indian forces inflicted around 2000 casualties on the Pakistanis (about 1000 dead and 1000 wounded) while Indian forces suffered only 33 dead and 102 wounded. His defence earned him the nickname '''Lion of Nowshera'''.<ref>\"Saluting the Brave\", [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]](India), 6 July 2006.</ref> Pakistani forces then announced a sum of Rs 50,000 as a prize for his head. Unaffected by praise and congratulations, Usman continued to sleep on a mat laid on the floor as he had vowed that he would not sleep on a bed till he recaptured Jhangar, from where he had had to withdraw in late 1947.<ref name=\"Academy\"/>\n\nThe then [[Lieutenant General]] [[Kodandera M. Cariappa|K M Cariappa]] (later [[General]] and Chief of Army Staff and years after retirement made [[Field Marshal (India)|Field Marshal]]), who had taken over as Western Army Commander, brought his tactical headquarters forward to [[Jammu]] to oversee the conduct of two important operations, namely the capture of Jhangar and [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]]. The operations commenced in the last week of February 1948. The 19th Infantry Brigade advanced along the northern ridge, while the 50th Parachute Brigade cleared the hills dominating the Nowshera-Jhangar road in the south.\n\nThe enemy was eventually driven from the area, and Jhangar was recaptured. Pakistan brought its regular forces into the fray in May 1948. Jhangar was once again subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, and  many determined attacks were launched on Jhangar by the Pakistan Army. However, Usman frustrated all their attempts to recapture it. It was during this defence of Jhangar that Usman was killed on 3 July 1948, by an enemy 25-pounder shell. He was 12 days short of his 36th birthday. His last words were \"I am dying but let not the territory we were fighting for fall for the enemy\". For his inspiring leadership and great courage, he was awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/heroes.htm |title=Citation on Brig.

This specific legislation was needed to enlist men who were not British subjects in the [[British Army]] and to allow [[George III]] to commission foreigners as officers.

The political arguments focused on two areas. Firstly, there were concerns over the government using foreign troops within the British isles, which was seen as a threat to British political liberty. Secondly, that by recruiting Frenchmen Britain was changing the nature of the war with France, and showing that it wanted to overturn the French Revolutionary government. [[Charles James Fox]], one of the MPs who said most on this, thought the war would be longer and more violent as a result, and negotiating a peace much harder.

The political arguments focused on two areas. Firstly, there were concerns over the government using foreign troops within the British isles, which was seen as a threat to British political liberty. Secondly, that by recruiting Frenchmen Britain was changing the nature of the war with France, and showing that it wanted to overturn the French Revolutionary government. [[Charles James Fox]], one of the MPs who said most on this, thought the war would be longer and more violent as a result, and negotiating a peace much harder. Despite these concerns being raised in Parliament, the government had enough of a majority for the bill to pass, although votes where held at each stage.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 9780230319684| pages = 59-60| editor-last1 = Arielli| editor1-first = Nir| editor-last2 = Collins| editor2-first = Bruce| last = Linch| first = Kevin| title = Transnational Soldiers: Foreign Military Enlistment in the Modern Era| chapter = The Politics of Foreign Recruitment in Britain during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars| location = Basingstoke| date = 2012 |doi= 10.1057/9781137296634_4 }}</ref> \n\n===Passage through Parliament===\n* Ordered: 7 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=429|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA429}}</ref>\n* Presented and read; ordered to be printed: 8 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=441|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA441}}</ref>\n* Committed: 11 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=458|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA458}}</ref>\n* Considered: 14 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=464|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA464}}</ref>\n* Reported; to be ingrossed; day appointed for Third Reading: 16 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |pages=478-479|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA478}}</ref>\n* Passed: 17 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=487|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA487}}</ref>\n* Agreed to in the [[House of Lords]]: 6 May 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=558|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA558}}</ref>\n* Received Royal Assent: 9 May 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=568|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA568}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of the Act==\nThe main terms of the Act were:\n* It was declared legal for Frenchmen to enlist and for George III to commission them as officers.\n* Their terms of enlistment restricted their service to the continent of Europe, the [[Channel Islands]], and any French territories outside Europe before 1792.\n* Officers held temporary rank and were not entitled to [[Half-pay#United_Kingdom|half-pay]] when units were disbanded.\n* Soldiers or officers in the units were not liable to prosecution or penalties under laws against Catholics.\n* The units could be landed in Great Britain, but notice of this had to given to Parliament.

In some cases it is a government or [[state-owned enterprise]].\n\nIn the United States [[railroad]] industry, an '''operating subsidiary''' is a company that is a subsidiary but operates with its own identity, [[locomotive]]s and [[rolling stock]]. In contrast, a '''non-operating subsidiary''' would exist on paper only (i.e., stocks, bonds, articles of incorporation) and would use the identity of the parent company.\n\nSubsidiaries are a common feature of business life and most [[multinational corporation]]s organize their operations in this way.<ref name=\"Drucker\">{{cite journal|title=The Global Economy and the Nation-State|last=Drucker|first=Peter F.|date=September\u2013October 1997|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|journal=Foreign Affairs|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1997-09-01/global-economy-and-nation-state}}</ref> Examples include holding companies such as [[Berkshire Hathaway]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/subs/sublinks.html|title=Links To Berkshire Hathaway Sub.

These, and others, organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries, often with multiple levels of subsidiaries.\n\n==Details==\nSubsidiaries are separate, distinct [[commercial law|legal]] entities for the purposes of [[tax]]ation, [[regulation]] and [[Legal liability|liability]]. For this reason, they differ from [[division (organization)|divisions]], which are businesses fully integrated within the main company, and not legally or otherwise distinct from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subsidiary |title=subsidiary legal definition of subsidiary. subsidiary synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> In other words, a subsidiary can sue and be sued separately from its parent and its obligations will not normally be the obligations of its parent. However, creditors of an insolvent subsidiary may be able to obtain a judgment against the parent if they can [[Piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]] and prove that the parent and subsidiary are mere alter egos of one another, therefore any copyrights, trademarks, and patents remain with the subsidiary until the parent shuts down the subsidiary.\n\nOne of the ways of controlling a subsidiary is achieved through the ownership of [[share (finance)|shares]] in the subsidiary by the parent. These shares give the parent the necessary votes to determine the composition of the board of the subsidiary, and so exercise control. This gives rise to the common presumption that 50% plus one share is enough to create a subsidiary. There are, however, other ways that control can come about, and the exact rules both as to what control is needed, and how it is achieved, can be complex (see below). A subsidiary may itself have subsidiaries, and these, in turn, may have subsidiaries of their own. A parent and all its subsidiaries together are called a [[corporate group|corporate]], although this term can also apply to cooperating companies and their subsidiaries with varying degrees of shared ownership.\n\nA parent company does not have to be the larger or \"more powerful\" entity; it is possible for the parent company to be smaller than a subsidiary, such as [[Danjaq|DanJaq]], a closely held family company, which controls [[Eon Productions]], the large corporation which manages the [[James Bond]] franchise. Conversely, the parent may be larger than some or all of its subsidiaries (if it has more than one), as the relationship is defined by control of ownership shares, not the number of employees. \n \nThe parent and the subsidiary do not necessarily have to operate in the same locations or operate the same businesses. Not only is it possible that they could conceivably be competitors in the marketplace, but such arrangements happen frequently at the end of a [[hostile takeover]] or voluntary merger. Also, because a parent company and a subsidiary are separate entities, it is entirely possible for one of them to be involved in legal proceedings, bankruptcy, tax delinquency, indictment or under investigation while the other is not.\n\n== Tiered subsidiaries ==\nIn descriptions of larger corporate structures, the terms \"first-tier subsidiary\", \"second-tier subsidiary\", \"third-tier subsidiary\" etc. are often used to describe multiple levels of subsidiaries. A first-tier subsidiary means a subsidiary/daughter company of the ultimate parent company,{{NoteTag|As with human family trees, each level above one level is the parent of the level below, so the term \"parent company\" in itself doesn't necessarily refer to the company at the top of the tree, so here \"ultimate parent company\" has been used for that.}}<ref name=\"Chron\">[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/first-tier-subsidiary-34982.html Houston Chronicle Small Business sector: ''What Is a First Tier Subsidiary?''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> while a second-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a first-tier subsidiary: a \"granddaughter\" of the main parent company.<ref>[http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/second-tier-subsidiary/ USLegal: ''Second-Tier Subsidiary Law & Legal Definition''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> Consequently, a third-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a second-tier subsidiary\u2014a \"great-granddaughter\" of the main parent company.\n\nThe ownership structure of the small British specialist company Ford Component Sales, which sells Ford components to specialist car manufacturers and [[OEM]] manufacturers, such as [[Morgan Motor Company]] and [[Caterham Cars]],<ref>[http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/AboutFord/Fordcomponentsales Ford Component Sales Ltd: ''High quality components for a variety of uses''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> illustrates how multiple levels of subsidiaries are used in large corporations:\n* [[Ford Motor Company]] \u2013 U.S. parent company based in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]]\n** Ford International Capital LLC \u2013 First-tier subsidiary (U.S. holding company located in Dearborn, Michigan, but registered in [[Delaware]])<ref name=SEC>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000115752311001210/a6622311_ex21.htm SEC: ''Subsidiaries of Ford Motor Company as of February 11, 2011''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref><ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35697873 Bloomberg Businessweek: ''Company Overview of Ford International Capital LLC''], page 2 Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n*** Ford Technologies Limited \u2013 Second-tier subsidiary (British holding company, located at the Ford UK head office in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], [[Essex]], with five employees)<ref>[https://www.duedil.com/company/04850367/blue-oval-holdings Duedil: ''Blue Oval Holdings''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n**** [[Ford of Britain|Ford Motor Company Limited]] \u2013 Third-tier subsidiary (the main British Ford company, with head office in Brentwood, with 10,500 employees)<ref>[https://www.duedil.com/company/00235446/ford-motor-company-limited Duedil: ''Ford Motor Company Limited''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n\n==Control==\n===General===\n\nThe word \"control\" and its derivatives (subsidiary and parent) may have different meanings in different contexts. These concepts may have different meanings in various areas of law (e.g. [[corporate law]], [[competition law]], [[capital markets law]]) or in [[accounting]]. For example, if Company A purchases shares in Company B, it is possible that the transaction is not subject to [[merger control]] (because Company A had been deemed to already control Company B before the share purchase, under competition law rules), but at the same time Company A may be required to start consolidating Company B into its financial statements under the relevant accounting rules (because it had been treated as a [[joint venture]] before the purchase for accounting purposes).\n\nControl can be direct (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls the first-tier subsidiary directly) or indirect (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls second and lower tiers of subsidiaries indirectly, through first-tier subsidiaries).\n\n===European Union===\nRecital 31 of Directive 2013/34/EU<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013L0034|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=DIRECTIVE 2013/34/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC}}</ref> stipulates that control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights, but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members. In certain circumstances, control may be effectively exercised where the parent holds a minority or none of the shares in the subsidiary.\n\nAccording to Article 22 of the directive 2013/34/EU an undertaking is a parent if it:\n* has a majority of the shareholders' or members' voting rights in another undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking);\n* has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) and is at the same time a shareholder in or member of that undertaking;\n* has the right to exercise a dominant influence over an undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) of which it is a shareholder or member, pursuant to a contract entered into with that undertaking or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association, where the law governing that subsidiary undertaking permits its being subject to such contracts or provisions.\n* is a shareholder in or member of an undertaking, and:\n** a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of that undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) who have held office during the financial year, during the preceding financial year and up to the time when the consolidated financial statements are drawn up, have been appointed solely as a result of the exercise of its voting rights; or\n** controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking), a majority of shareholders' or members' voting rights in that undertaking.\nAdditionally control may arise when:\n* a parent undertaking has the power to exercise, or actually exercises, dominant influence or control over another undertaking (the subsidiary undertaking); or\n* a parent undertaking and another undertaking (the subsidiary undertaking) are managed on a unified basis by the parent undertaking.\n\nUnder the international accounting standards adopted by the EU<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ:L:2008:320:TOC|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1126/2008 of 3 November 2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council}}</ref> a company is deemed to control another company only if it has all the following:\n* power over the other company;\n* exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the other company; and\n* the ability to use its power over the other company to affect the number of the company's returns ([[IFRS]] 10 para 7). Power generally arises when the parent has rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the other subsidiary's returns.\n\nA subsidiary can have only one parent; otherwise, the subsidiary is, in fact, a joint arrangement (joint operation or joint venture) over which two or more parties have joint control (IFRS 11 para 4). Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[Companies Act 2006]] contains two definitions: one of \"subsidiary\" and the other \"subsidiary undertaking\".\n\nAccording to s.1159 of the Act a company is a \"subsidiary\" of another company, its \"holding company\", if that other company:\n* holds a majority of the voting rights in it, or\n* is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or\n* is a member of it and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other members, a majority of the voting rights in it, or if it is a subsidiary of a company that is itself a subsidiary of that other company.\n\nThe second definition is broader. According to s.1162 of the Companies Act 2006, an undertaking is a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking, a subsidiary undertaking, if:\n* it holds a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking, or\n* it is a member of the undertaking and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or\n* it has the right to exercise a dominant influence over the undertaking\u2014\n** by virtue of provisions contained in the undertaking's articles, or\n** by virtue of a control contract, or\n* it is a member of the undertaking and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members, a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking.\n\nAn undertaking is also a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking, a subsidiary undertaking, if:\n* it has the power to exercise, or actually exercises, dominant influence or control over it, or\n* it and the subsidiary undertaking are managed on a unified basis.\n\nThe broader definition of \"subsidiary undertaking\" is applied to the accounting provisions of the Companies Act 2006, while the definition of \"subsidiary\" is used for general purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/16.html|accessdate=2015-01-19|title=Farstad Supply AS v Enviroco Ltd [2011] UKSC 16, para 16}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn [[Oceania]], the accounting standards defined the circumstances in which one entity controls another.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In doing so, they largely abandoned the legal control concepts in favour of a definition that provides that \"control\" is \"the capacity of an entity to dominate decision-making, directly or indirectly, in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so as to enable that other entity to operate with it in pursuing the objectives of the controlling entity\".

In some cases it is a government or [[state-owned enterprise]].\n\nIn the United States [[railroad]] industry, an '''operating subsidiary''' is a company that is a subsidiary but operates with its own identity, [[locomotive]]s and [[rolling stock]]. In contrast, a '''non-operating subsidiary''' would exist on paper only (i.e., stocks, bonds, articles of incorporation) and would use the identity of the parent company.\n\nSubsidiaries are a common feature of business life and most [[multinational corporation]]s organize their operations in this way.<ref name=\"Drucker\">{{cite journal|title=The Global Economy and the Nation-State|last=Drucker|first=Peter F.|date=September\u2013October 1997|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|journal=Foreign Affairs|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1997-09-01/global-economy-and-nation-state}}</ref> Examples include holding companies such as [[Berkshire Hathaway]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/subs/sublinks.html|title=Links To Berkshire Hathaway Sub.

These, and others, organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries, often with multiple levels of subsidiaries.\n\n==Details==\nSubsidiaries are separate, distinct [[commercial law|legal]] entities for the purposes of [[tax]]ation, [[regulation]] and [[Legal liability|liability]]. For this reason, they differ from [[division (organization)|divisions]], which are businesses fully integrated within the main company, and not legally or otherwise distinct from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subsidiary |title=subsidiary legal definition of subsidiary. subsidiary synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> In other words, a subsidiary can sue and be sued separately from its parent and its obligations will not normally be the obligations of its parent. However, creditors of an insolvent subsidiary may be able to obtain a judgment against the parent if they can [[Piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]] and prove that the parent and subsidiary are mere alter egos of one another, therefore any copyrights, trademarks, and patents remain with the subsidiary until the parent shuts down the subsidiary.\n\nOne of the ways of controlling a subsidiary is achieved through the ownership of [[share (finance)|shares]] in the subsidiary by the parent. These shares give the parent the necessary votes to determine the composition of the board of the subsidiary, and so exercise control. This gives rise to the common presumption that 50% plus one share is enough to create a subsidiary. There are, however, other ways that control can come about, and the exact rules both as to what control is needed, and how it is achieved, can be complex (see below). A subsidiary may itself have subsidiaries, and these, in turn, may have subsidiaries of their own. A parent and all its subsidiaries together are called a [[corporate group|corporate]], although this term can also apply to cooperating companies and their subsidiaries with varying degrees of shared ownership.\n\nA parent company does not have to be the larger or \"more powerful\" entity; it is possible for the parent company to be smaller than a subsidiary, such as [[Danjaq|DanJaq]], a closely held family company, which controls [[Eon Productions]], the large corporation which manages the [[James Bond]] franchise. Conversely, the parent may be larger than some or all of its subsidiaries (if it has more than one), as the relationship is defined by control of ownership shares, not the number of employees. \n \nThe parent and the subsidiary do not necessarily have to operate in the same locations or operate the same businesses. Not only is it possible that they could conceivably be competitors in the marketplace, but such arrangements happen frequently at the end of a [[hostile takeover]] or voluntary merger. Also, because a parent company and a subsidiary are separate entities, it is entirely possible for one of them to be involved in legal proceedings, bankruptcy, tax delinquency, indictment or under investigation while the other is not.\n\n== Tiered subsidiaries ==\nIn descriptions of larger corporate structures, the terms \"first-tier subsidiary\", \"second-tier subsidiary\", \"third-tier subsidiary\" etc. are often used to describe multiple levels of subsidiaries. A first-tier subsidiary means a subsidiary/daughter company of the ultimate parent company,{{NoteTag|As with human family trees, each level above one level is the parent of the level below, so the term \"parent company\" in itself doesn't necessarily refer to the company at the top of the tree, so here \"ultimate parent company\" has been used for that.}}<ref name=\"Chron\">[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/first-tier-subsidiary-34982.html Houston Chronicle Small Business sector: ''What Is a First Tier Subsidiary?''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> while a second-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a first-tier subsidiary: a \"granddaughter\" of the main parent company.<ref>[http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/second-tier-subsidiary/ USLegal: ''Second-Tier Subsidiary Law & Legal Definition''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> Consequently, a third-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a second-tier subsidiary\u2014a \"great-granddaughter\" of the main parent company.\n\nThe ownership structure of the small British specialist company Ford Component Sales, which sells Ford components to specialist car manufacturers and [[OEM]] manufacturers, such as [[Morgan Motor Company]] and [[Caterham Cars]],<ref>[http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/AboutFord/Fordcomponentsales Ford Component Sales Ltd: ''High quality components for a variety of uses''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref> illustrates how multiple levels of subsidiaries are used in large corporations:\n* [[Ford Motor Company]] \u2013 U.S. parent company based in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]]\n** Ford International Capital LLC \u2013 First-tier subsidiary (U.S. holding company located in Dearborn, Michigan, but registered in [[Delaware]])<ref name=SEC>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000115752311001210/a6622311_ex21.htm SEC: ''Subsidiaries of Ford Motor Company as of February 11, 2011''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref><ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35697873 Bloomberg Businessweek: ''Company Overview of Ford International Capital LLC''], page 2 Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n*** Ford Technologies Limited \u2013 Second-tier subsidiary (British holding company, located at the Ford UK head office in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], [[Essex]], with five employees)<ref>[https://www.duedil.com/company/04850367/blue-oval-holdings Duedil: ''Blue Oval Holdings''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n**** [[Ford of Britain|Ford Motor Company Limited]] \u2013 Third-tier subsidiary (the main British Ford company, with head office in Brentwood, with 10,500 employees)<ref>[https://www.duedil.com/company/00235446/ford-motor-company-limited Duedil: ''Ford Motor Company Limited''] Retrieved 2013-04-12</ref>\n\n==Control==\n===General===\n\nThe word \"control\" and its derivatives (subsidiary and parent) may have different meanings in different contexts. These concepts may have different meanings in various areas of law (e.g. [[corporate law]], [[competition law]], [[capital markets law]]) or in [[accounting]]. For example, if Company A purchases shares in Company B, it is possible that the transaction is not subject to [[merger control]] (because Company A had been deemed to already control Company B before the share purchase, under competition law rules), but at the same time Company A may be required to start consolidating Company B into its financial statements under the relevant accounting rules (because it had been treated as a [[joint venture]] before the purchase for accounting purposes).\n\nControl can be direct (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls the first-tier subsidiary directly) or indirect (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls second and lower tiers of subsidiaries indirectly, through first-tier subsidiaries).\n\n===European Union===\nRecital 31 of Directive 2013/34/EU<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013L0034|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=DIRECTIVE 2013/34/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC}}</ref> stipulates that control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights, but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Without fresh air venting to the interior via dash outlets, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.\n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line.

The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture.

As local custom allowed the writing of a check on any surface, Fiat delivered the contribution, written on the hood of an actual Panda.<ref name=\"stampa01\"/>\n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders.\n\n===Design===\nFollowing the brief of creating a straighforward, practical design in the vein of the [[Citroen 2CV]] and the [[Renault 4]], Italdesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Without fresh air venting to the interior via dash outlets, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.\n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda. Mechanically it is based on the Panda 4x4, offering the same choice of powertrains.\nAs in the previous generation the Cross is recognizable by its wider 185/65 tyres on specific alloy wheels, new fascias with prominent skid plates and unique broken up head- and taillights arrangement.
