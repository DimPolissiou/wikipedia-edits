From 1903, the Austro-Hungarian general staff began to plan for the expectation of a war against Italy.{{sfnp|Rothenburg|1976|pp=124\u2013125}}. This would require improved heavy artillery, and the means to move it in mountainous country. Particular concerns were the forts of {{illm|Fort Verena{{!}}Verena|de|Forte Monte Verena|it|Forte Verena}}, {{illm|Fort Campolongo{{!}}Campolongo|de|Forte Campolongo|it|Forte Campolongo}} and {{illm|Fort Campomolon{{!}}Campomolon|de|Forte Campomolon|it|Forte Campomolon}}.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" />\n\nThe army of Austria-Hungary also obtained large [[siege mortar]]s.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" /> These were difficult to transport, even though they could be separated into two loads: barrel and carriage.\n\n== Austro-Daimler ==\n[[Austro-Daimler]] had previously provided the [[Lohner-Porsche]] car for trials with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In 1904, [[Paul Daimler]] had produced the first [[armored car (military)|armoured car]] with a turret. Austro-Daimler's first successful contract to build vehicles for the army was to be a series of [[artillery tractor]]s to move these mortars. Paul Daimler had returned to [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] at [[Stuttgart]] in 1905 and in 1906 [[Ferdinand Porsche]] had been appointed as his successor as the chief engineer at Austro-Daimler in [[Wiener Neustadt]], with [[Otto K\u00f6hler (motor engineer)|Otto K\u00f6hler]] as his design engineer.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=14\u201315}}\n\n== M 06 ==\nCaptain Robert Wolf{{efn-lr|Wolf was soon promoted to Major, eventually to become a General{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}}}} was the head of Army research and development.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}} He was an advocate of army mechanisation and now sought a tug or [[artillery tractor]] for the new heavy siege artillery.\n\nOne of Porsche's first projects was the M&nbsp;06, intended as this artillery tug. It used Paul Daimler's four-wheel drive system from the armoured car chassis, lengthened to a wheelbase of {{convert|3,200|mm}}. Engine power was increased with an 8,500&nbsp;cc engine of 50&nbsp;bhp. Drive through the steering joints of the front wheels used the same system as Paul Daimler's armoured car, with a series of [[bevel gear]]s and vertical shafts within the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]]s.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16\u201319}} It was also fitted with a drum winch.\n\nThe inspector general of artillery, [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]], had his own ideas about mechanical transport. Having a mechanical background, he had already patented his own design of four-wheel drive system. This used a complex central differential and diagonal shafts to each wheel. Skoda constructed a 40&nbsp;bhp example named 'Lion'{{efn-lr|The Austro-Hungarian army developed a tradition of naming military vehicles after animals.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}}}}, although its four-wheel steering was so heavy that the steering wheel had to be made large enough to allow two men to haul on it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16\u201319}}\n\n== M 08 ==\nThe first large production contract for the military, was the M&nbsp;08 of 1908. Wolf approached Eduard Fischer, managing director of Austro-Daimler, and his engineer Porsche to provide a dozen tractors for towing large mortars. These were of similar size to and developed from the M&nbsp;06 design, but with significant improvements. The first of these was a new engine, of twice the power. Although intended as [[ballast tractor|tractor unit]]s, they also had a wooden load-carrying body at the rear. This was made deeper than on the M&nbsp;06, with the top edge sloping downwards to the rear.  The overall silhouette of the tractor gave rise to its name of 'Robbe' or [[pinniped|Seal]].\n\nThe engine was Austro-Daimler's own design for an [[inline-six]] of 13,854&nbsp;cc and giving a power of 80&nbsp;bhp. The cylinders were cast, in typical fashion for the time, as three pairs of [[monobloc cylinders|non-monobloc cylinders]] with [[sidevalve]]s.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\nFollowing Robert Wolf's influence, each vehicle was fitted with its own drum winch under the nose, which could be used to climb slopes too steep for the solid rubber tyres to grip on. One of the first batch was also equipped as a recovery vehicle, with a large winch on the rear deck, carrying 1,000 feet of cable.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\nAlthough well-received by the military, this whole new type of military vehicle was far from perfected as yet, particularly for its four-wheel drive system and the difficulty of driving it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\n== M 09 ==\nThe M&nbsp;09 or 'Titan' of 1911 was an evolutionary development of the M&nbsp;08 and used the same 80&nbsp;bhp engine.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=21\u201323}}\n\nAround this time, the German Daimler company were no longer investors in the Austro-Daimler company. This pleased the Austro-Hungarian military, who at this time saw Germany as both a potential (and eventual) ally, but also a potential enemy. Investment instead came from the [[Bohemia]]n [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]], who were Austro-Hungarian and more acceptable to the military. Especially so as they had recently moved their head office to [[Vienna]]. Skoda's controlling interest also led to Eduard Fischer's replacement as managing director by Skoda's secretary, Burmann, although the real executive power now became Porsche's alone.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=21\u201323}}\n\n== M 12 ==\n[[File:Austrian 30.5cm Mortar Transportation.jpeg|thumb|[[:en:Skoda 305 mm Model 1911|Skoda M 11 30.5cm siege mortar]], with M 12 tractor carrying the crew]]\nThe Austro-Hungarian Army increased its artillery with an even heavier mortar, the [[Skoda 305 mm Model 1911|Skoda M 11 30.5cm siege mortar]], intended for use against the Italian fortifications.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" /> Development of this piece began in 1906 and two dozen of them were ordered by the end of 1911. In March 1912, Austro-Daimler began work on a more powerful artillery tractor for them and the first tractors were completed by the end of the year. A rapid start was possible because the Army was in such a rush for them that it used a '[[slush fund]]' to pay for them, rather than waiting for a formal tender and budget allocation process.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}}\n\nThis new M&nbsp;12 tractor was nicknamed the 'Hundred', after its 100&nbsp;hp engine of 20,300&nbsp;cc. Another inline-six, this had twin spark ignition and twin updraught carburettors. The chassis and drivetrain were similar to the M&nbsp;09 and used the same system of bevel shafts in the kingpins. The centre differential was lockable. Weight had increased to {{convert|8000|kg|lb}} and required new ten-spoke cast wheels, rather than the previous eight-spoke. The rear wheels were larger than the front, at {{convert|1.5|m|inch}}, and also had double tyres fitted, althrough these were still of a treadless solid rubber pattern. Each tractor was now capable of towing between 30 and 36 tons, depending on road conditions.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} The wooden side boards of the tractor body folded down to make rows of lengthwise bench seats to carry the mortar crew.\n\nEight mortar batteries were formed, with two apiece, and each mortar train potentially requiring three tractors. Forty 'Hundreds' were supplied for this, rather than the full forty eight, as some of the mortars were used defensively, or were expected to be moved by rail.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}}\n\n=== War service  ===\nAlthough intended for use by the Austro-Hungarian Army, against Italian fortifications, their first use came on the [[Western Front (World War I)#War plans \u2013 Battle of the Frontiers|Western Front]] in a historically decisive campaign at the start of World War I. Germany [[Schlieffen Plan|planned to invade France]] by passing through the neutral country of Belgium, in order to attack France's less defended Northern flank. This involved assaulting the Belgian forts, particularly [[Battle of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] and its [[Fortified position of Li\u00e8ge|ring of forts]], which began on the 6 August 1914 with a rapid assault, repulsed by the Belgians, and which then developed into a protracted siege. This was what the forts had been designed to withstand and they were expected to hold out for at least a month, allowing time for a [[counterattack]] to be mounted.\n\nThis early in the war, only the two prototypes of the German [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Krupp {{convert|420| mm|in|0|abbr=on}} mortar]] had been completed. To defeat Li\u00e8ge. Germany called upon its Austro-Hungarian ally for support. Eight of the Skoda 305mm mortars, with their tractors, were deployed but the Li\u00e8ge forts surrendered by the 16 August, before they had arrived.{{sfnp|Romanych|Rupp|2013|page=26}}<ref name=\"FAJ, Belgian Forts\" />{{efn-lr|There is some question as to the deployment of the Skoda mortars. Ludwigsen{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} describes them as having been used at Li\u00e8ge.}}\n\nThe process was repeated at [[Fortified position of Namur#The Namur forts in 1914|Namur]], from 21 to 23 August. The Austro-Hungarian mortars arrived by rail on the 20 August, spent two days driving the {{convert|50|km}} to their positions, and went into action on 22 August.<ref name=\"FAJ, 30.5cm mortar\" /> German experience and the Austro-Hungarian mortars made their siege against similar forts even quicker.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} After a further drive of {{convert|60|km}} they arrived at [[Siege of Maubeuge|Maubeuge]] on 29 August and that fort surrendered on 8 September.<ref name=\"FAJ, 30.5cm mortar\" />\n\n=== M 12/14, M 12/15, M 12/16 ===\nThe M&nbsp;12 continued to be built after the first batch. By 1915 developed versions, the M&nbsp;12/14 and M&nbsp;12/15, had been produced. In 1916 the 13{{frac|1|4}} ton M&nbsp;12/16 was built as a cable-drum carrier.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=27}} \n\nThis increasing weight highlighted a drawback to the wheels and their plain rubber tyres. The Hungarian importer of the [[continuous track|fully-tracked]] [[Holt tractor]], Dr Leo Steiner, arranged a test in May 1914. An early M12 was driven 500 feet across 'semi-swamp' terrain before becoming bogged down, whilst the Holt managed to cross the whole 750 feet width of it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=27}}{{sfnp|Glanfield|2013|page=23}} \n\n{{Commons category-inline|Austro-Daimler M.12}}\n\n== M 17 ==\n[[File:Austro-Daimler M 17 'Goliath' artillery tractor with Skoda M 11 mortar.jpg|thumb|M 17 'Goliath' with Skoda M 11 305mm mortar, outside the Austro-Daimler works in 1917]]\nTo improve its performance on poor ground, with the trial against the Holt tractor in mind, Porsche developed a new version of the tractor. The M&nbsp;17 or 'Goliath' had equally-sized wheels front and rear of {{convert| 1460|mm| inch|sigfig=3}}. These were constructed of riveted steel and had wide cleated rims for grip, rather than rubber tyres, which also saved on rubber, a [[strategic material]]. The tractor had a wheelbase of {{convert|3|m}} and a weight of 10 tons. A whole new engine design was produced, an inline-four of 13,500&nbsp;cc producing 80&nbsp;bhp @ 800&nbsp;rpm and with a governed top speed of 1,050&nbsp;rpm. This had inclined [[overhead valve engine|overhead valve]]s, based on Austro-Daimler's aircraft engine work. The bodywork was redesigned, with a steel half-height cab, but the previous fixed roof replaced by folding canvas.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=25\u201327}}\n\nPerformance of this tractor was improved enough that the whole mortar train, on its two trailers and ammunition limber, could be hauled by a single tractor. Eleven shells could also be carried in the tractor body.\n\nLarge numbers of the M17 were produced throughout the war, for general haulage and as a tractor for the [[:en:15 cm Autokanone M. 15/16|15cm Autokanone M.15/16]], the new designation 'Autokanone' denoting the first artillery piece to be designed from the outset for motorised haulage.<ref name=\"Landships, M 17\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Austro-Daimler Artilleriezugwagen M.17\n  |website=Landships.info\n  |url=http://www.landships.info/landships/softskin_articles/austro_daimler_tractor_m17.html\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Austro-Daimler M 17}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Austro-Daimler land trains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=The heavy Austrian mortar 30,5 cm/M11\n  |author=Jim Haugh\n  |work=WW1 Southern Front Artillery and Fortification History\n  |url=http://www.moesslang.net/WW1%20Fortification%20History.htm\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FAJ, Belgian Forts\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=Concerning The Fall Of The Belgian Forts\n  |journal=The Field Artillery Journal\n  |date=October-December 1914 \n  |volume=IV  |issue=4\n  |author=H.

Particular concerns were the forts of {{illm|Fort Verena{{!}}Verena|de|Forte Monte Verena|it|Forte Verena}}, {{illm|Fort Campolongo{{!}}Campolongo|de|Forte Campolongo|it|Forte Campolongo}} and {{illm|Fort Campomolon{{!}}Campomolon|de|Forte Campomolon|it|Forte Campomolon}}.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" />\n\nThe army of Austria-Hungary also obtained large [[siege mortar]]s.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" /> These were difficult to transport, even though they could be separated into two loads: barrel and carriage.\n\n== Austro-Daimler ==\n[[Austro-Daimler]] had previously provided the [[Lohner-Porsche]] car for trials with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In 1904, [[Paul Daimler]] had produced the first [[armored car (military)|armoured car]] with a turret. Austro-Daimler's first successful contract to build vehicles for the army was to be a series of [[artillery tractor]]s to move these mortars. Paul Daimler had returned to [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] at [[Stuttgart]] in 1905 and in 1906 [[Ferdinand Porsche]] had been appointed as his successor as the chief engineer at Austro-Daimler in [[Wiener Neustadt]], with [[Otto K\u00f6hler (motor engineer)|Otto K\u00f6hler]] as his design engineer.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=14\u201315}}\n\n== M 06 ==\nCaptain Robert Wolf{{efn-lr|Wolf was soon promoted to Major, eventually to become a General{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}}}} was the head of Army research and development.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}} He was an advocate of army mechanisation and now sought a tug or [[artillery tractor]] for the new heavy siege artillery.\n\nOne of Porsche's first projects was the M&nbsp;06, intended as this artillery tug. It used Paul Daimler's four-wheel drive system from the armoured car chassis, lengthened to a wheelbase of {{convert|3,200|mm}}. Engine power was increased with an 8,500&nbsp;cc engine of 50&nbsp;bhp. Drive through the steering joints of the front wheels used the same system as Paul Daimler's armoured car, with a series of [[bevel gear]]s and vertical shafts within the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]]s.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16\u201319}} It was also fitted with a drum winch.\n\nThe inspector general of artillery, [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]], had his own ideas about mechanical transport. Having a mechanical background, he had already patented his own design of four-wheel drive system. This used a complex central differential and diagonal shafts to each wheel. Skoda constructed a 40&nbsp;bhp example named 'Lion'{{efn-lr|The Austro-Hungarian army developed a tradition of naming military vehicles after animals.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=2}}}}, although its four-wheel steering was so heavy that the steering wheel had to be made large enough to allow two men to haul on it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16\u201319}}\n\n== M 08 ==\nThe first large production contract for the military, was the M&nbsp;08 of 1908. Wolf approached Eduard Fischer, managing director of Austro-Daimler, and his engineer Porsche to provide a dozen tractors for towing large mortars. These were of similar size to and developed from the M&nbsp;06 design, but with significant improvements. The first of these was a new engine, of twice the power. Although intended as [[ballast tractor|tractor unit]]s, they also had a wooden load-carrying body at the rear. This was made deeper than on the M&nbsp;06, with the top edge sloping downwards to the rear.  The overall silhouette of the tractor gave rise to its name of 'Robbe' or [[pinniped|Seal]].\n\nThe engine was Austro-Daimler's own design for an [[inline-six]] of 13,854&nbsp;cc and giving a power of 80&nbsp;bhp. The cylinders were cast, in typical fashion for the time, as three pairs of [[monobloc cylinders|non-monobloc cylinders]] with [[sidevalve]]s.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\nFollowing Robert Wolf's influence, each vehicle was fitted with its own drum winch under the nose, which could be used to climb slopes too steep for the solid rubber tyres to grip on. One of the first batch was also equipped as a recovery vehicle, with a large winch on the rear deck, carrying 1,000 feet of cable.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\nAlthough well-received by the military, this whole new type of military vehicle was far from perfected as yet, particularly for its four-wheel drive system and the difficulty of driving it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=16,18\u201319,21}}\n\n== M 09 ==\nThe M&nbsp;09 or 'Titan' of 1911 was an evolutionary development of the M&nbsp;08 and used the same 80&nbsp;bhp engine.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=21\u201323}}\n\nAround this time, the German Daimler company were no longer investors in the Austro-Daimler company. This pleased the Austro-Hungarian military, who at this time saw Germany as both a potential (and eventual) ally, but also a potential enemy. Investment instead came from the [[Bohemia]]n [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]], who were Austro-Hungarian and more acceptable to the military. Especially so as they had recently moved their head office to [[Vienna]]. Skoda's controlling interest also led to Eduard Fischer's replacement as managing director by Skoda's secretary, Burmann, although the real executive power now became Porsche's alone.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=21\u201323}}\n\n== M 12 ==\n[[File:Austrian 30.5cm Mortar Transportation.jpeg|thumb|[[:en:Skoda 305 mm Model 1911|Skoda M 11 30.5cm siege mortar]], with M 12 tractor carrying the crew]]\nThe Austro-Hungarian Army increased its artillery with an even heavier mortar, the [[Skoda 305 mm Model 1911|Skoda M 11 30.5cm siege mortar]], intended for use against the Italian fortifications.<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" /> Development of this piece began in 1906 and two dozen of them were ordered by the end of 1911. In March 1912, Austro-Daimler began work on a more powerful artillery tractor for them and the first tractors were completed by the end of the year. A rapid start was possible because the Army was in such a rush for them that it used a '[[slush fund]]' to pay for them, rather than waiting for a formal tender and budget allocation process.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}}\n\nThis new M&nbsp;12 tractor was nicknamed the 'Hundred', after its 100&nbsp;hp engine of 20,300&nbsp;cc. Another inline-six, this had twin spark ignition and twin updraught carburettors. The chassis and drivetrain were similar to the M&nbsp;09 and used the same system of bevel shafts in the kingpins. The centre differential was lockable. Weight had increased to {{convert|8000|kg|lb}} and required new ten-spoke cast wheels, rather than the previous eight-spoke. The rear wheels were larger than the front, at {{convert|1.5|m|inch}}, and also had double tyres fitted, althrough these were still of a treadless solid rubber pattern. Each tractor was now capable of towing between 30 and 36 tons, depending on road conditions.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} The wooden side boards of the tractor body folded down to make rows of lengthwise bench seats to carry the mortar crew.\n\nEight mortar batteries were formed, with two apiece, and each mortar train potentially requiring three tractors. Forty 'Hundreds' were supplied for this, rather than the full forty eight, as some of the mortars were used defensively, or were expected to be moved by rail.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}}\n\n=== War service  ===\nAlthough intended for use by the Austro-Hungarian Army, against Italian fortifications, their first use came on the [[Western Front (World War I)#War plans \u2013 Battle of the Frontiers|Western Front]] in a historically decisive campaign at the start of World War I. Germany [[Schlieffen Plan|planned to invade France]] by passing through the neutral country of Belgium, in order to attack France's less defended Northern flank. This involved assaulting the Belgian forts, particularly [[Battle of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] and its [[Fortified position of Li\u00e8ge|ring of forts]], which began on the 6 August 1914 with a rapid assault, repulsed by the Belgians, and which then developed into a protracted siege. This was what the forts had been designed to withstand and they were expected to hold out for at least a month, allowing time for a [[counterattack]] to be mounted.\n\nThis early in the war, only the two prototypes of the German [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Krupp {{convert|420| mm|in|0|abbr=on}} mortar]] had been completed. To defeat Li\u00e8ge. Germany called upon its Austro-Hungarian ally for support. Eight of the Skoda 305mm mortars, with their tractors, were deployed but the Li\u00e8ge forts surrendered by the 16 August, before they had arrived.{{sfnp|Romanych|Rupp|2013|page=26}}<ref name=\"FAJ, Belgian Forts\" />{{efn-lr|There is some question as to the deployment of the Skoda mortars. Ludwigsen{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} describes them as having been used at Li\u00e8ge.}}\n\nThe process was repeated at [[Fortified position of Namur#The Namur forts in 1914|Namur]], from 21 to 23 August. The Austro-Hungarian mortars arrived by rail on the 20 August, spent two days driving the {{convert|50|km}} to their positions, and went into action on 22 August.<ref name=\"FAJ, 30.5cm mortar\" /> German experience and the Austro-Hungarian mortars made their siege against similar forts even quicker.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=23\u201325}} After a further drive of {{convert|60|km}} they arrived at [[Siege of Maubeuge|Maubeuge]] on 29 August and that fort surrendered on 8 September.<ref name=\"FAJ, 30.5cm mortar\" />\n\n=== M 12/14, M 12/15, M 12/16 ===\nThe M&nbsp;12 continued to be built after the first batch. By 1915 developed versions, the M&nbsp;12/14 and M&nbsp;12/15, had been produced. In 1916 the 13{{frac|1|4}} ton M&nbsp;12/16 was built as a cable-drum carrier.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=27}} \n\nThis increasing weight highlighted a drawback to the wheels and their plain rubber tyres. The Hungarian importer of the [[continuous track|fully-tracked]] [[Holt tractor]], Dr Leo Steiner, arranged a test in May 1914. An early M12 was driven 500 feet across 'semi-swamp' terrain before becoming bogged down, whilst the Holt managed to cross the whole 750 feet width of it.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|page=27}}{{sfnp|Glanfield|2013|page=23}} \n\n{{Commons category-inline|Austro-Daimler M.12}}\n\n== M 17 ==\n[[File:Austro-Daimler M 17 'Goliath' artillery tractor with Skoda M 11 mortar.jpg|thumb|M 17 'Goliath' with Skoda M 11 305mm mortar, outside the Austro-Daimler works in 1917]]\nTo improve its performance on poor ground, with the trial against the Holt tractor in mind, Porsche developed a new version of the tractor. The M&nbsp;17 or 'Goliath' had equally-sized wheels front and rear of {{convert| 1460|mm| inch|sigfig=3}}. These were constructed of riveted steel and had wide cleated rims for grip, rather than rubber tyres, which also saved on rubber, a [[strategic material]]. The tractor had a wheelbase of {{convert|3|m}} and a weight of 10 tons. A whole new engine design was produced, an inline-four of 13,500&nbsp;cc producing 80&nbsp;bhp @ 800&nbsp;rpm and with a governed top speed of 1,050&nbsp;rpm. This had inclined [[overhead valve engine|overhead valve]]s, based on Austro-Daimler's aircraft engine work. The bodywork was redesigned, with a steel half-height cab, but the previous fixed roof replaced by folding canvas.{{sfnp|Ludvigsen|2014|pages=25\u201327}}\n\nPerformance of this tractor was improved enough that the whole mortar train, on its two trailers and ammunition limber, could be hauled by a single tractor. Eleven shells could also be carried in the tractor body.\n\nLarge numbers of the M17 were produced throughout the war, for general haulage and as a tractor for the [[:en:15 cm Autokanone M. 15/16|15cm Autokanone M.15/16]], the new designation 'Autokanone' denoting the first artillery piece to be designed from the outset for motorised haulage.<ref name=\"Landships, M 17\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Austro-Daimler Artilleriezugwagen M.17\n  |website=Landships.info\n  |url=http://www.landships.info/landships/softskin_articles/austro_daimler_tractor_m17.html\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Commons category-inline|Austro-Daimler M 17}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Austro-Daimler land trains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Haugh, 30.5cm mortar\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=The heavy Austrian mortar 30,5 cm/M11\n  |author=Jim Haugh\n  |work=WW1 Southern Front Artillery and Fortification History\n  |url=http://www.moesslang.net/WW1%20Fortification%20History.htm\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FAJ, Belgian Forts\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=Concerning The Fall Of The Belgian Forts\n  |journal=The Field Artillery Journal\n  |date=October-December 1914 \n  |volume=IV  |issue=4\n  |author=H.
