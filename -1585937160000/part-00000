Marxism uses a [[materialist]] methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of class society and especially of [[capitalism]] as well as the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic, social and political change.\n\nAccording to [[Marxist theory]], class conflict arises in [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited [[proletariat]]\u2014a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services\u2014and the [[bourgeoisie]]\u2014the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] produced by the proletariat in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. In periods of deep crisis, the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a [[proletarian revolution]] which, if victorious, leads to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]\u2014a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, socialism would be transformed into a [[communist society]], i.e. a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution based on one's needs]].\n\nWhile it originates from the works of 19th century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena\u2014including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]] improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or\u2014this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms\u2014with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution\".<ref>''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859).

Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.</ref>\n\n[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \"Men make their own history\".

Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn=978-0415198776}}</ref>\n\nAs a term, orthodox Marxism refers to the methods of historical materialism and of [[dialectical materialism]] and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.<ref>Luk\u00e1cs, Georg.

Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early 20th-century [[Russian Empire]]. Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class. In 1903, Lenin stated: <blockquote>We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society. The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm \"To the Rural Poor\" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat\u2014as is traditional to Marxism\u2014are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \"Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald Grigor|last=Suny|title=Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920|volume=1|publisher=Pathfinder Press|location=New York City|date=1991|ISBN=978-0-87348-940-9|page=xiii}}</ref> The other distinguishing characteristic of Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] of the time, a loose, multitendency organization, was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of [[democratic centralism]].<ref>{{cite book|first=August H.|last=Nimtz|title=Lenin's Electoral Strategy from Marx and Engels Through the Revolution of 1905: The Ballot, the Streets\u2014or Both|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh4CAwAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=2014|isbn=978-1137389961|page=56}}</ref>\n\n== Left communism ==\n{{main|Left communism}}\n[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first two congresses.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald I.|last=Kowalski|title=The Bolshevik Party in Conflict: The Left Communist Opposition of 1918|publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=1991|ISBN=978-1-349-10369-0|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10367-6|page=2}}</ref>  \n\nAlthough she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent left communist groups existing today include the [[International Communist Current]] and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n== Council communism ==\n{{main|Council communism}}\n[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\nIn contrast to [[social democracy]] and [[Leninism]], the central argument of council communism is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the revolutionary Leninist ideologies, with their stress on respectively parliaments and institutional government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).\n\nThe core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Command economy|state-run authoritarian]] [[state socialism]]/[[state capitalism]]. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\n== Trotskyism ==\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leon Trotsky]]]]\n[[Trotskyism]] is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Opposed to [[Stalinism]], Trostkyism supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another [[communist revolution]] in the Soviet Union which Trotsky claimed had become a [[degenerated worker's state]] under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nStruggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Communist International]]. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.\n\nTrotsky's followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist\u2013Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought\u2014foremost is the theory of permanent revolution. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own [[bourgeois-democratic revolution]]s. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. With power in its hands, the proletariat would then continue this revolution permanently, transforming it from a national bourgeois revolution to a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist]] [[World revolution|international revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|authorlink=Leon Trotsky|title=The Permanent Revolution|date=1931|quote=The Permanent Revolution is Not a \u2018Leap\u2019 by the Proletariat, but the Reconstruction of the Nation under the Leadership of the Proletariat.}}</ref>\n\nAnother shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Joshua|title=Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary's Life|date=2011|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hartford, Connecticut|isbn=9780300137248|pages=155\u2013202}}</ref> and subsequently from the Soviet Union.

It is the variety of [[anti-revisionism]] that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for [[socialist revolution]] called [[protracted people's war]] in what he termed the [[semi-feudal]] countries of the [[Third World]] and that relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics which he called contradictions.\n\n[[Hoxhaism]], so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman [[Enver Hoxha]], was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but it grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called [[Three Worlds Theory]] put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that socialism had never existed in China at all.\n\n== Maoism ==\n{{main|Maoism}}\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[Maoism]] ({{lang-zh|s=\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3|p=M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng s\u012bxi\u01ceng|l=Mao Zedong Thought}}) is the theory that [[Mao Zedong]] developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and later the [[People's Republic of China]].

Written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923, the collection  of essays contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy.

He wrote in his ''Ten Theses'' (1950) that \"the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction\" and that \"today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism  Today]</ref>\n\n==== Antonio Gramsci ====\n[[Antonio Gramsci]] (22 January 1891{{spaced ndash}}27 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]].  He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime. These writings, known as the ''Prison Notebooks'', contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name such as:\n* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[State (polity)|state]] in a capitalist society\n* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class\n* The distinction between [[political society]] (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent\n* \"Absolute [[historicism]]\"\n* The critique of [[economic determinism]]\n* The critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]\n\n==== Herbert Marcuse ====\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] (19 July 1898 \u2013 29 July 1979) was a prominent German-American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School.\n\nMarcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as \"the father of the [[New Left]]\", a term he disliked and rejected.\n\n==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (21 June 1905 \u2013 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on [[individualism|individualistic]] [[existentialism]]. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ronald|last=Aronson|url=http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion/ronald-aronson-philosophy-our-time|title=The Philosophy of Our Time|magazine=[[Boston Review]]|publisher=Boston Critic, Inc.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], calling him \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Anderson|title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|location=New York City|date=1997|ISBN=978-0802144119|page=[https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl/page/468 468]}}</ref>\n\n==== Louis Althusser ====\n[[Louis Althusser]] (16 October 1918 \u2013 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a lifelong member and sometimes strong critic of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on Marxist theory and [[humanism]] and [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.\n\nHis essay ''Marxism and Humanism'' is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like \"human potential\" and \"species-being\", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of \"humanity\". His essay ''Contradiction and Overdetermination'' borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]] in order to replace the idea of \"contradiction\" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]]).\n\nAlthusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is ''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Althusser|authorlink=Louis Althusser|chapter=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|title=Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays|date=1970|publisher=[[Monthly Review Press]]|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013176|ISBN=0-902308-89-0|language=French|translator-first=Ben|translator-last=Brewster}}</ref> The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.\n\n=== Structural Marxism ===\n{{main|Structural Marxism}}\n[[Structural Marxism]] is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.\n\n=== Neo-Marxism ===\n{{main|Neo-Marxism}}\n[[Neo-Marxism]] is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of [[Friedrich Engels]], which focused on dialectical idealism rather than [[dialectical materialism]]. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]. Neo-Marxism adds [[Max Weber]]'s broader understanding of [[social inequality]], such as [[Social status|status]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]], to orthodox Marxist thought.\n\n=== Frankfurt School ===\n{{main|Frankfurt School}}\n{{Frankfurt School}}\nThe [[Frankfurt School]] is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (''Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung'') of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. The term \"Frankfurt School\" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them\u2014it is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves.\n\nThe Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after [[World War I]] and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions.\n\nMax Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis in the 1954 work ''Eros and Civilization''). Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], crude materialism and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by returning to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in German [[idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[negation]] and [[contradiction]] as inherent properties of reality.\n\n== British Marxist Historians ==\nThe British Marxist historians were a circle of historians that originated in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in the 1930s, eventually forming the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] in 1946. They shared a common interest in \"history from below\" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Dona Torr]], [[A.L. Morton]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[George Rud\u00e9]], [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Dorothy Thompson (historian)|Dorothy Thompson]], [[John Saville]], [[Victor Kiernan]] and [[Raphael Samuel]]. \n\nWhile some members of the group (most notably E.P. Thompson) left the party after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed great emphasis on human agency, cultural experience and the subjective determination of history, while growing increasingly distant from [[determinist]] views of materialism.  E. P. Thompson famously engaged Louis Althusser in ''The Poverty of Theory'',<ref>Thompson, E. P., (1978). ''The Poverty of Theory & other essays'' Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.</ref> arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.\n\n== Autonomist Marxism ==\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[Autonomism]] is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties.  Autonomist Marxists, including [[Harry Cleaver]], broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework\u2014it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|21st century empire]].\n\n== Analytical Marxism ==\n{{main|Analytical Marxism}}\n[[Analytical Marxism]] refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent among a half-dozen [[Analytic philosophy|analytically trained]] English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the [[September Group]] of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself \"Non-Bullshit Marxism\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marcus|last=Roberts|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/analytical-marxism-an-ex-paradigm|title=Analytical Marxism \u2013 an ex-paradigm?

It was opposed by Louis Althusser's \"[[antihumanism]]\", who qualified it as a revisionist movement.\n\nMarxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue\u2014the ''Manuscripts of 1844'' were published only in 1932. They stress that there is continuity between these early writings and the economic theory of Marx's ''[[Das_Kapital|Capital]]'' and that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to properly understand his later works.\n\n== Marxist theology ==\n{{see also|Religious communism|Religious socialism|Christian left|Black theology}}\nAlthough Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized [[religion]] including [[Christianity]], some Christians have \"accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Richardson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC|chapter=Marxist Theology|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|publisher=[[SCM Press]]|location=London, England|date=1989|ISBN=978-0334022084|page=352}}</ref> Some of the resulting examples are some forms of [[liberation theology]] and [[black theology]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican [[Spe Salvi|condemning]] acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian [[James H.

Its most eminent proponents were [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]], [[Otto Bauer]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and\n[[Karl Renner]]. It was influenced by contemporaneous intellectual trends, including the prominence of [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]] in [[philosophy]] and the emergence of [[marginalism]] in [[economics]]. The group confronted issues such as the problem of the [[National Question]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the rise of the interventionist state and the changing class-structure of early 20th century capitalist societies.<ref name=Bottomore>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bottomore |first=Tom | author-link=Tom Bottomore | editor1-last=Bottomore | editor1-first=Tom | editor2-last=Harris | editor2-first=Laurence | editor3-last=Kiernan |editor3-first=V.G. | editor3-link=V.

De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] which exists to the present day.\n\nDe Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movements\u2014especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]\u2014and consider them to be reformist or [[Bourgeois socialism|bourgeois socialist]].\n\nDe Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like [[Social justice#Social justice movements|social justice movements]].\n\n== Eurocommunism ==\n{{main|Eurocommunism}}\nBeginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] under [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] under [[Santiago Carrillo]] tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name [[Eurocommunism]] was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.<ref>Kingsley, Richard, ed. (1981). ''In Search of Eurocommunism''. Macmillan.</ref>\n\n== Post-Marxism ==\n{{main|Post-Marxism}}\n[[Post-Marxism]] represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.\n\nMarxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as \"Marxism\". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the [[Classic Maya collapse]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/a-marxist-history-of-the-world/9299-a-marxist-history-of-the-world-27-new-world-empires-maya-aztec-and-inca|title=A Marxist History of the World part 27: New World Empires: Maya, Aztec, and Inca|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> (c. 900 A.D.) \u2013 without mentioning Marxism by name.\n\n== Marxist feminism ==\n{{main|Marxist feminism}}\n[[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of [[feminism|feminist]] theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that [[private property]], which gives rise to [[economic inequality]] as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.\n\nAccording to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations\u2014that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see [[gender inequality]] as determined ultimately by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. Gender oppression is [[Oppression#Class oppression|class oppression]] and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at [[Domestic worker|domestic labour]] as well as [[Wage slavery|wage work]] in order to support their position.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marxist schools of thought|*]]\n[[Category:Marxist theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead too short|date=December 2017}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Marxism}}\n[[Marxism]] is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that frames [[capitalism]] through a paradigm of exploitation, analyzes [[Social class|class]] relations and [[Social conflict|social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. Marxism uses a [[materialist]] methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of class society and especially of [[capitalism]] as well as the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic, social and political change.\n\nAccording to [[Marxist theory]], class conflict arises in [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited [[proletariat]]\u2014a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services\u2014and the [[bourgeoisie]]\u2014the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] produced by the proletariat in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. In periods of deep crisis, the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a [[proletarian revolution]] which, if victorious, leads to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]\u2014a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, socialism would be transformed into a [[communist society]], i.e. a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution based on one's needs]].\n\nWhile it originates from the works of 19th century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.</ref>\n\n[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \"Men make their own history\".

Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn=978-0415198776}}</ref>\n\nAs a term, orthodox Marxism refers to the methods of historical materialism and of [[dialectical materialism]] and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.<ref>Luk\u00e1cs, Georg.

Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early 20th-century [[Russian Empire]]. Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class. In 1903, Lenin stated: <blockquote>We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society. The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm \"To the Rural Poor\" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat\u2014as is traditional to Marxism\u2014are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \"Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald Grigor|last=Suny|title=Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920|volume=1|publisher=Pathfinder Press|location=New York City|date=1991|ISBN=978-0-87348-940-9|page=xiii}}</ref> The other distinguishing characteristic of Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] of the time, a loose, multitendency organization, was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of [[democratic centralism]].<ref>{{cite book|first=August H.|last=Nimtz|title=Lenin's Electoral Strategy from Marx and Engels Through the Revolution of 1905: The Ballot, the Streets\u2014or Both|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh4CAwAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=2014|isbn=978-1137389961|page=56}}</ref>\n\n== Left communism ==\n{{main|Left communism}}\n[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first two congresses.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald I.|last=Kowalski|title=The Bolshevik Party in Conflict: The Left Communist Opposition of 1918|publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=1991|ISBN=978-1-349-10369-0|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10367-6|page=2}}</ref>  \n\nAlthough she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent left communist groups existing today include the [[International Communist Current]] and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n== Council communism ==\n{{main|Council communism}}\n[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\nIn contrast to [[social democracy]] and [[Leninism]], the central argument of council communism is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the revolutionary Leninist ideologies, with their stress on respectively parliaments and institutional government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).\n\nThe core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Command economy|state-run authoritarian]] [[state socialism]]/[[state capitalism]]. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\n== Trotskyism ==\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leon Trotsky]]]]\n[[Trotskyism]] is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Opposed to [[Stalinism]], Trostkyism supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another [[communist revolution]] in the Soviet Union which Trotsky claimed had become a [[degenerated worker's state]] under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nStruggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Communist International]]. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.\n\nTrotsky's followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist\u2013Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought\u2014foremost is the theory of permanent revolution. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own [[bourgeois-democratic revolution]]s. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. With power in its hands, the proletariat would then continue this revolution permanently, transforming it from a national bourgeois revolution to a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist]] [[World revolution|international revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|authorlink=Leon Trotsky|title=The Permanent Revolution|date=1931|quote=The Permanent Revolution is Not a \u2018Leap\u2019 by the Proletariat, but the Reconstruction of the Nation under the Leadership of the Proletariat.}}</ref>\n\nAnother shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Joshua|title=Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary's Life|date=2011|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hartford, Connecticut|isbn=9780300137248|pages=155\u2013202}}</ref> and subsequently from the Soviet Union.

[[Anti-revisionism]] is a faction within Marxist\u2013Leninism that rejects Khrushchev's theses.

It is the variety of [[anti-revisionism]] that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for [[socialist revolution]] called [[protracted people's war]] in what he termed the [[semi-feudal]] countries of the [[Third World]] and that relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics which he called contradictions.\n\n[[Hoxhaism]], so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman [[Enver Hoxha]], was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but it grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called [[Three Worlds Theory]] put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that socialism had never existed in China at all.\n\n== Maoism ==\n{{main|Maoism}}\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[Maoism]] ({{lang-zh|s=\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3|p=M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng s\u012bxi\u01ceng|l=Mao Zedong Thought}}) is the theory that [[Mao Zedong]] developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and later the [[People's Republic of China]]. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China.

He wrote in his ''Ten Theses'' (1950) that \"the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction\" and that \"today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism  Today]</ref>\n\n==== Antonio Gramsci ====\n[[Antonio Gramsci]] (22 January 1891{{spaced ndash}}27 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]].  He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime. These writings, known as the ''Prison Notebooks'', contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name such as:\n* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[State (polity)|state]] in a capitalist society\n* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class\n* The distinction between [[political society]] (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent\n* \"Absolute [[historicism]]\"\n* The critique of [[economic determinism]]\n* The critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]\n\n==== Herbert Marcuse ====\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] (19 July 1898 \u2013 29 July 1979) was a prominent German-American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School.\n\nMarcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as \"the father of the [[New Left]]\", a term he disliked and rejected.\n\n==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (21 June 1905 \u2013 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on [[individualism|individualistic]] [[existentialism]]. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ronald|last=Aronson|url=http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion/ronald-aronson-philosophy-our-time|title=The Philosophy of Our Time|magazine=[[Boston Review]]|publisher=Boston Critic, Inc.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], calling him \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Anderson|title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|location=New York City|date=1997|ISBN=978-0802144119|page=[https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl/page/468 468]}}</ref>\n\n==== Louis Althusser ====\n[[Louis Althusser]] (16 October 1918 \u2013 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a lifelong member and sometimes strong critic of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on Marxist theory and [[humanism]] and [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.\n\nHis essay ''Marxism and Humanism'' is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like \"human potential\" and \"species-being\", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of \"humanity\". His essay ''Contradiction and Overdetermination'' borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]] in order to replace the idea of \"contradiction\" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]]).\n\nAlthusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is ''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Althusser|authorlink=Louis Althusser|chapter=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|title=Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays|date=1970|publisher=[[Monthly Review Press]]|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013176|ISBN=0-902308-89-0|language=French|translator-first=Ben|translator-last=Brewster}}</ref> The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.\n\n=== Structural Marxism ===\n{{main|Structural Marxism}}\n[[Structural Marxism]] is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.\n\n=== Neo-Marxism ===\n{{main|Neo-Marxism}}\n[[Neo-Marxism]] is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of [[Friedrich Engels]], which focused on dialectical idealism rather than [[dialectical materialism]]. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]. Neo-Marxism adds [[Max Weber]]'s broader understanding of [[social inequality]], such as [[Social status|status]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]], to orthodox Marxist thought.\n\n=== Frankfurt School ===\n{{main|Frankfurt School}}\n{{Frankfurt School}}\nThe [[Frankfurt School]] is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (''Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung'') of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. The term \"Frankfurt School\" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them\u2014it is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves.\n\nThe Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after [[World War I]] and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions.\n\nMax Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis in the 1954 work ''Eros and Civilization''). Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], crude materialism and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by returning to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in German [[idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[negation]] and [[contradiction]] as inherent properties of reality.\n\n== British Marxist Historians ==\nThe British Marxist historians were a circle of historians that originated in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in the 1930s, eventually forming the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] in 1946. They shared a common interest in \"history from below\" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Dona Torr]], [[A.L. Morton]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[George Rud\u00e9]], [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Dorothy Thompson (historian)|Dorothy Thompson]], [[John Saville]], [[Victor Kiernan]] and [[Raphael Samuel]]. \n\nWhile some members of the group (most notably E.P. Thompson) left the party after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed great emphasis on human agency, cultural experience and the subjective determination of history, while growing increasingly distant from [[determinist]] views of materialism. Thompson famously engaged Louis Althusser in ''The Poverty of Theory'',<ref>Thompson, E. P., (1978). ''The Poverty of Theory & other essays'' Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.</ref> arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.\n\n== Autonomist Marxism ==\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[Autonomism]] is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties.  Autonomist Marxists, including [[Harry Cleaver]], broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework\u2014it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|21st century empire]].\n\n== Analytical Marxism ==\n{{main|Analytical Marxism}}\n[[Analytical Marxism]] refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent among a half-dozen [[Analytic philosophy|analytically trained]] English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the [[September Group]] of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself \"Non-Bullshit Marxism\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marcus|last=Roberts|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/analytical-marxism-an-ex-paradigm|title=Analytical Marxism \u2013 an ex-paradigm?

It was opposed by Louis Althusser's \"[[antihumanism]]\", who qualified it as a revisionist movement.\n\nMarxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue\u2014the ''Manuscripts of 1844'' were published only in 1932. They stress that there is continuity between these early writings and the economic theory of Marx's ''[[Das_Kapital|Capital]]'' and that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to properly understand his later works.\n\n== Marxist theology ==\n{{see also|Religious communism|Religious socialism|Christian left|Black theology}}\nAlthough Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized [[religion]] including [[Christianity]], some Christians have \"accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Richardson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC|chapter=Marxist Theology|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|publisher=[[SCM Press]]|location=London, England|date=1989|ISBN=978-0334022084|page=352}}</ref> Some of the resulting examples are some forms of [[liberation theology]] and [[black theology]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican [[Spe Salvi|condemning]] acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian [[James H. Cone]] wrote in his book ''For My People'' that \"for analyzing the structure of capitalism. Marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality, and thereby help Christians to see how things really are\".<ref>{{cite book|first=James H.|last=Cone|authorlink=James H.

Its most eminent proponents were [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]], [[Otto Bauer]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and\n[[Karl Renner]]. It was influenced by contemporaneous intellectual trends, including the prominence of [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]] in [[philosophy]] and the emergence of [[marginalism]] in [[economics]]. The group confronted issues such as the problem of the [[National Question]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the rise of the interventionist state and the changing class-structure of early 20th century capitalist societies.<ref name=Bottomore>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bottomore |first=Tom | author-link=Tom Bottomore | editor1-last=Bottomore | editor1-first=Tom | editor2-last=Harris | editor2-first=Laurence | editor3-last=Kiernan |editor3-first=V.G. | editor3-link=V.

De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] which exists to the present day.\n\nDe Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movements\u2014especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]\u2014and consider them to be reformist or [[Bourgeois socialism|bourgeois socialist]].\n\nDe Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like [[Social justice#Social justice movements|social justice movements]].\n\n== Eurocommunism ==\n{{main|Eurocommunism}}\nBeginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] under [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] under [[Santiago Carrillo]] tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name [[Eurocommunism]] was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.<ref>Kingsley, Richard, ed. (1981). ''In Search of Eurocommunism''. Macmillan.</ref>\n\n== Post-Marxism ==\n{{main|Post-Marxism}}\n[[Post-Marxism]] represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.\n\nMarxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as \"Marxism\". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the [[Classic Maya collapse]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/a-marxist-history-of-the-world/9299-a-marxist-history-of-the-world-27-new-world-empires-maya-aztec-and-inca|title=A Marxist History of the World part 27: New World Empires: Maya, Aztec, and Inca|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> (c. 900 A.D.) \u2013 without mentioning Marxism by name.\n\n== Marxist feminism ==\n{{main|Marxist feminism}}\n[[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of [[feminism|feminist]] theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that [[private property]], which gives rise to [[economic inequality]] as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.\n\nAccording to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations\u2014that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see [[gender inequality]] as determined ultimately by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. Gender oppression is [[Oppression#Class oppression|class oppression]] and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at [[Domestic worker|domestic labour]] as well as [[Wage slavery|wage work]] in order to support their position.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marxist schools of thought|*]]\n[[Category:Marxist theory]]\n", "name_user": "Hanshans23", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBritish Marxist Historians:distinguish \"Thompson\" from his wife Dorothy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_schools_of_thought"}

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government.Kay Ivey (current governor) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n*Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham\n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Di[[Red panda|r]]<nowiki/>ector: Wesley H[[Elephant|e]]<nowiki/>lton\n* Administrator of the [[Armadillo|A]]<nowiki/>lcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government.Kay Ivey (current governor) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n*Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham\n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Di[[Red panda|r]]<nowiki/>ector: Wesley H[[Elephant|e]]<nowiki/>lton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry.

He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne.

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared. Attention has slowly returned.<ref>Hannes Leidinger, \" Historiography 1918-Today (Austria-Hungary)\" ''International encyclopedia of the First World War'' (Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 2017)   DOI: 10.15463/ie1418.10326</ref>\n\nHelmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], described Charles as \"a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician.\"<ref>see [https://www.dw.com/en/historians-question-the-beatification-of-blessed-charles/a-1092974 online]</ref> Others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried to stop the war in which his Empire was doing so poorly. The English [[Neo-Jacobite Revival|Neo-Jacobite]] writer, [[Herbert Vivian]], wrote: <blockquote>Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come.<ref>* {{cite book |last=Vivian |first=Herbert |title=The Life of the Emperor Charles of Austria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3jUAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Grayson and Grayson |date=1932 |oclc=10030055}}</ref></blockquote> [[Anatole France]], the French novelist, stated: \n<blockquote>This war without end is criminal. What is abominable is that they do not want to end it. No, they do not want. Do not try to tell me that there was no way to end it. Emperor Charles offered peace; he is the only decent man to have appeared in this war, and he was not listened to. There was, through him, a chance that could have been seized... Clemenceau called the emperor a \"rotten conscience,\" it's ignoble. Emperor Charles sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. [...] A king of France, yes a king, would have had pity on our poor, exhausted, bloodlet nation. However democracy is without a heart and without entrails.

[[Pope John Paul II]] was also beatifying and canonizing a significantly larger number of individuals as saints during the later part of his reign as Pope, which could have influenced his decision to beatify Emperor Charles I as Charles the Blessed.<ref>{{cite news|author=By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/15/world/rome-journal-vatican-saint-factory-is-it-working-too-hard.html |title=Rome Journal - Vatican 'Saint Factory' - Is It Working Too Hard? |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=1989-04-15 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, Emperor Charles conceived of his office as a holy service to his people.

The son of [[Archduke Otto of Austria (1865\u20131906)|Archduke Otto of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]], Charles became [[heir presumptive]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] after his uncle [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated in 1914]]. In 1911, he married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. He made secret attempts to negotiate Austria-Hungary's exit from the [[World War I|First World War]] but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles' intention to preserve the empire by transforming it into a federal union, Austria-Hungary headed rapidly towards complete dissolution; [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] were proclaimed and [[First Hungarian Republic|Hungary]] declared to cease her monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles \"renounced participation\" in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 he was formally dethroned by the Austrian Parliament and exiled to Switzerland.\n\nCharles spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; both failed due to a lack of support from Hungary's [[Regent of Hungary|regent]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he soon fell ill and died of [[respiratory failure]] in 1922.\n\n[[beatification|Beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, Charles is known to the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Blessed Karl of Austria'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emperorcharles.org |title=Blessed Karl of Austria |publisher=Emperorcharles.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kaiser Karl I as a child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|Charles as a child, c.1889]]\n\nCharles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of [[Persenbeug-Gottsdorf|Persenbeug]], in [[Lower Austria]]. His parents were [[Archduke Otto Franz of Austria]] and [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867\u20131944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]]. At the time, his great-uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] reigned as [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Upon the death of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolph]] in 1889, the Emperor's brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new [[heir presumptive]].\n\nArchduke Charles was reared a devout [[Catholic]]. He spent his early years wherever his father's regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in [[Vienna]] and [[Reichenau an der Rax]]. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906-08 as an officer chiefly in [[Prague]], where he studied [[Law]] and [[Political Science]] concurrently with his military duties.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922 |last=Pribram |first=Alfred Francis | wstitle=Charles}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various [[Bohemia]]n garrison towns. Charles' relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.<ref name=eb/>\n\n== Marriage ==\n[[File:Hochzeit Erzh Karl und Zita Schwarzau 1911c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Charles and Zita's wedding, {{nowr|21 October 1911}}]]\nIn 1911, Charles married Princess [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]]. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his [[Dragoon]] regiment was stationed at [[Brand\u00fds nad Labem-Star\u00e1 Boleslav|Brand\u00fds nad Labem]] in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at [[Franti\u0161kovy L\u00e1zn\u011b|Franzensbad]].<ref name = \"Beeche\">Beeche.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nIt was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|5}} Due to Franz Ferdinand's [[morganatic marriage]] in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry. Zita not only shared Charles' devout Catholicism, but also an impeccable royal lineage.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\">{{cite book|last=Brook-Shepherd|first=G.|date=1991|title=The Last Empress: The Life and Times of Zita of Austria-Hungary, 1892\u20131989|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780002158619}}</ref>{{rp|16}} Zita later recalled:\n\n{{quote|We were of course glad to meet again and became close friends. On my side feelings developed gradually over the next two years. He seemed to have made his mind up much more quickly, however, and became even more keen when, in the autumn of 1910, rumours spread about that I had got engaged to a distant Spanish relative, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]].\n\nOn hearing this, the Archduke came down post haste from his regiment at Brandeis and sought out his [step]grandmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Archduchess Maria Theresa]], who was also my aunt and the natural confidante in such matters. He asked if the rumor was true and when told it was not, he replied, \"Well, I had better hurry in any case or she will get engaged to someone else.\"<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{rp|8}}}}\n\nArchduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita's parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court.<ref name=\"Beeche\"/>{{Rp|8}} Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast.<ref name=\"Brook-Shepherd\"/>{{Rp|19}} Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\nCharles became heir presumptive after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, the event which precipitated [[World War I]]. Only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to his crown in affairs of state. But the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the war at headquarters at [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], but exercised no military influence.<ref name=eb/>\n\nCharles then became a ''[[List of Austrian field marshals|Feldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]ns and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]ns.<ref name=eb/>\n\n==Reign==\n\n[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|King Charles IV taking his [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|coronation oath]] at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]], [[Budapest]], 30 December 1916]]\n[[File:Karlfamily.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the recently crowned King Charles IV and [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Queen Zita]] with their son [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]]]]\n\nCharles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 after the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph.  \nOn 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the whole army, succeeding [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich]]. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made.<ref>David Stevenson, \"The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.\" ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65-86.</ref> Foreign minister [[Ottokar Czernin|Graf Czernin]] was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany, Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] published letters signed by him.  This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally.<ref>Edward P. Keleher, \"Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916-1918.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.</ref>\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with much tension between ethnic groups. As part of his [[Fourteen Points]], U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe new foreign minister Baron [[Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz|Istvan Buri\u00e1n]] asked for an armistice 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state.  The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian.  Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and [[Trieste]] was to have a special status. However, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied four days later that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, autonomy inside the Empire for the nationalities was no longer enough. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|independent South Slav state]] 29 October 1918.\n\n===Trialism and Croatia===\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Karl favored the creation of a third Croatian political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia]] with [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Rijeka]]<ref name=\"Karlova zavjernica\">(Hrvatska) Krunidbena zavjernica Karla IV. hrvatskom Saboru 28. prosinca 1916.

One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles' political future became uncertain.  On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles' realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the [[German Austria]]n State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.\n\n== <span id=\"Proclamations\"></span>Proclamations of November 1918 ==\n[[File:Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Karl I. 11.11.1918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of 11 November 1918]]\nOn the day of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and \"relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.\"<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=C.

On the same day, the Imperial Family left [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] and moved to Castle [[Eckartsau]], east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation\u2014the Eckartsau Proclamation\u2014for Hungary.\n\nAlthough it has widely been cited as an \"abdication\", the word itself was never used in either proclamation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gomb\u00e1s|first=I.|date=2002|title=Kings and Queens of Hungary, Princes of Transylvania|location=Budapest|publisher=Corvina|isbn=9789631347593}}</ref> Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word ''abdication'' in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to [[Friedrich Gustav Piffl]], the [[Archbishop of Vienna]]: \"I did not abdicate, and never will&nbsp;[...] I see my manifesto of 11 November as the equivalent to a cheque which a street thug has forced me to issue at gunpoint&nbsp;[...] I do not feel bound by it in any way whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"Scheidl\">{{cite news|last=Werner|first=H.

An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]].\n\nAs the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that \"whatever the national assembly of German Austria has resolved with respect to these matters since 11 November is null and void for me and my House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Portisch|first=H.|date=1989|title=\u00d6sterreich I: die untersch\u00e4tzte Republik|language=de|location=Vienna|publisher=Kremayr & Scheriau|isbn=9783218004855|page=117}}</ref> The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this \"Manifesto of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]\" at this time\u2014it had been dispatched only to King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and to [[Pope Benedict XV]] through diplomatic channels\u2014and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor's departure without explicit abdication.\n\nThe [[Austrian Parliament]] responded on 3 April with the [[Habsburg Law]], which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] at [[Lake Constance]], and later moved to Ch\u00e2teau de [[Prangins]] at [[Lake Geneva]] on 20 May.\n\n==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==\n{{main|Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne}}\nEncouraged by Hungarian royalists (\"legitimists\"), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary's [[regent]], [[Admiral]] [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] (the last commander of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial and Royal Navy]]), refused to support Charles' restoration. Horthy's action was declared \"treasonous\" by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy's actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, [[Little Entente|neighbouring countries]] had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\n==Exile in Madeira, Portugal and death==\n[[File:Karl Grabmal Monte.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles I in Madeira]]\nAfter the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested and quarantined at [[Tihany Abbey]].

In the interwar years he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular interest and academic interest in the 1914\u20131918 war practically disappeared.
