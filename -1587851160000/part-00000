However, by the time Lu announced in September 2019 that she would contest the [[2020 Taiwan presidential election|2020 presidential election]] on behalf of the [[Formosa Alliance]], she was still a member of the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\n==Early life==\nLu was born in T\u014den Town (now [[Taoyuan City]]), in northern Taiwan, during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].

Lu then became increasingly active in the tang-wai, the opposition movement calling for democracy and an end to authoritarian rule.\n\nIn 1979 she delivered a 20-minute speech criticizing the government at an International Human Rights Day rally that later became known as the [[Kaohsiung Incident]]. Following this rally, virtually the entire leadership of Taiwan's democracy movement, including Lu, was imprisoned. She was tried, found guilty of violent sedition, and sentenced by a military court to 12 years in prison. She was named by [[Amnesty International]] as a [[prisoner of conscience]], and, due to international pressure, coupled with the work of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and [[Jerome A.

Following this rally, virtually the entire leadership of Taiwan's democracy movement, including Lu, was imprisoned.

For example,  in the early 1970s he (and independently Howard Odum) were the first to point out the energy intensiveness of modern agriculture.<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J.

The annual economic loss reported at the time was $123 billion. In most of his studies he attempted to generate quantitative estimates, even of quite difficult and large scale issues.\n\nPimentel\u2019s approach was often associated with controversy. He was seen as overly \u201cgreen\u201d and hostile to conventional farming by some, and he was sometimes criticized for some of his numbers and conclusions.<ref>Is Ethanol Energy-Efficient? http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol_energy.html</ref> Usually later papers would back up his initial results.\n\n\n\n==Early life and education==\nPimentel was born on May 24, 1925, in Fresno, California and moved with his family to a farm in North Middleboro, Massachusetts.<ref>Whitecraft, Michele, Going Against \u201cProcedures\u201d: A Profile of Dave Pimentel.

The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics. ''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., et al. (1973).</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.)

(1976). Pages 5-6 in Huffaker, C.B., and PS Messenger. (eds.) ''Theory and practice of biological control''. Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

Hoddle. (2009.) Pages 4-5 in ''Control of pests and weeds by natural enemies: an introduction to biological control''. Blackwell Publishing. Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues. That paper then putatively initiated the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

Patzek, (2005). Ethanol production using corn, switchgrass, and wood: biodiesel production using soybean and sunflower. ''Natural Resources Research'' '''14'''(1):65-76.</ref><ref>Farrell, A.E., Plevin, R.J., Turner, B.T., Jones, A.D,. O\u2019Hare, M., and D.M. Kammen. (2006).

O\u2019Hare, M., and D.M. Kammen. (2006).Energy Returns on Ethanol Production ''Science'' '''312''':1746-1748.</ref> has apparently been similarly resolved. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, who was annoyed at the critiques of Pimentel\u2019s estimates, or more accurately why there should be such large differences (about a factor of two) between two different estimates of what should be a pretty straightforward analysis, it was finally agreed that most of the energy used for each of the inputs (as, for example, for tractor fuel, fertilizer) were reasonably similar, although Pimentel tended to be more inclusive, including the energy cost to produce that fuel, and also the seeds, pesticides, steel etc.  needed.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> Hence his energy costs tended to be about a third higher. Additionally Dale reduced his energy costs by about a quarter to give credit for \u201cco-products\u201d such as corn mash that could be fed to chickens. In that paper, Pimentel accepted that in some situations that would be appropriate.\n\nWhat was not said in that paper, or in the critiques more generally, was that the real issue was not whether the EROI for alcohol fuel was less than 0.8 to 1 versus the 1.7 to 1 estimated (with coproducts) by Dale. The issue was that what a society needed was not a marginal energy return on investment such as 1.7 to 1 but a substantially positive one, from 3 to 1 at a bare minimum to perhaps 12 to 1 for a society like we live in today.<ref>Hall, C. A. S., Balogh, S., and D. J. R. Murphy. (2009). What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have? ''Energies'' '''2''':25-47.</ref><ref>Lambert. et a. (2014).</ref> \n\nOne agricultural scientist even wrote: \u201cAn interested reader will ask why considering [sic] only the energy used to produce the cement for the processing factory, why not the energy used for the material used to produce the cement, why not the energy used to produce the material used to produce the cement, why not \u2026? Accounting for the energy used to produce inputs used results in an infinite accounting sequence and hence an infinite amount of energy as input being used and, hence an infinite amount of production costs\"<ref>Wesseler.

The reader will perhaps recognize one of [[Zeno's Paradoxes]] here. In the end, the energy inputs quickly fall off to insignificance.

For example,  in the early 1970s he (and independently Howard Odum) were the first to point out the energy intensiveness of modern agriculture.<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J.

The annual economic loss reported at the time was $123 billion. In most of his studies he attempted to generate quantitative estimates, even of quite difficult and large scale issues.\n\nPimentel\u2019s approach was often associated with controversy. He was seen as overly \u201cgreen\u201d and hostile to conventional farming by some, and he was sometimes criticized for some of his numbers and conclusions.<ref>Is Ethanol Energy-Efficient? http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol_energy.html</ref> Usually later papers would back up his initial results.\n\n\n\n==Early life and education==\nPimentel was born on May 24, 1925, in Fresno, California and moved with his family to a farm in North Middleboro, Massachusetts.<ref>Whitecraft, Michele, Going Against \u201cProcedures\u201d: A Profile of Dave Pimentel.

The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics. ''Science'' '''331''':426-429.</ref>\n\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn<ref>Pimentel, D., et al. (1973).</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to becoming a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published, the results of which always could, and were, inspected and revised.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on his observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref> It was not an idea that was readily accepted, however, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.)

(1976). Pages 5-6 in Huffaker, C.B., and PS Messenger. (eds.) ''Theory and practice of biological control''. Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and his colleagues. That paper then putatively initiated the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

Patzek, (2005). Ethanol production using corn, switchgrass, and wood: biodiesel production using soybean and sunflower. ''Natural Resources Research'' '''14'''(1):65-76.</ref><ref>Farrell, A.E., Plevin, R.J., Turner, B.T., Jones, A.D,. O\u2019Hare, M., and D.M. Kammen. (2006).

O\u2019Hare, M., and D.M. Kammen. (2006).Energy Returns on Ethanol Production ''Science'' '''312''':1746-1748.</ref> has apparently been similarly resolved. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, who was annoyed at the critiques of Pimentel\u2019s estimates, or more accurately why there should be such large differences (about a factor of two) between two different estimates of what should be a pretty straightforward analysis, it was finally agreed that most of the energy used for each of the inputs (as, for example, for tractor fuel, fertilizer) were reasonably similar, although Pimentel tended to be more inclusive, including the energy cost to produce that fuel, and also the seeds, pesticides, steel etc.  needed.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> Hence his energy costs tended to be about a third higher. Additionally Dale reduced his energy costs by about a quarter to give credit for \u201cco-products\u201d such as corn mash that could be fed to chickens. In that paper, Pimentel accepted that in some situations that would be appropriate.\n\nWhat was not said in that paper, or in the critiques more generally, was that the real issue was not whether the EROI for alcohol fuel was less than 0.8 to 1 versus the 1.7 to 1 estimated (with coproducts) by Dale. The issue was that what a society needed was not a marginal energy return on investment such as 1.7 to 1 but a substantially positive one, from 3 to 1 at a bare minimum to perhaps 12 to 1 for a society like we live in today.<ref>Hall, C. A. S., Balogh, S., and D. J. R. Murphy. (2009). What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have? ''Energies'' '''2''':25-47.</ref><ref>Lambert. et a. (2014).</ref> \n\nOne agricultural scientist even wrote: \u201cAn interested reader will ask why considering [sic] only the energy used to produce the cement for the processing factory, why not the energy used for the material used to produce the cement, why not the energy used to produce the material used to produce the cement, why not \u2026? Accounting for the energy used to produce inputs used results in an infinite accounting sequence and hence an infinite amount of energy as input being used and, hence an infinite amount of production costs\"<ref>Wesseler.

The reader will perhaps recognize one of [[Zeno's Paradoxes]] here. In the end, the energy inputs quickly fall off to insignificance.

The [biblical] injunctions to take the land are embedded in narrative and give the appearance of being addressed to a specific generation, like the commandment to annihilate or expel the natives of Canaan, which refers specifically to the seven Canaanite nations...

I used to think that were they [Midianites] suddenly to appear, no Jew would be willing to carry out such a commandment. Then [[Baruch Goldstein]] appeared on the scene, and he was followed by [[Yigal Amir]] and now I am not sure.... I find the commandment to commit [[genocide]] against the Midianite unacceptable.

The annual [[Purim]] festival celebrates this event, and includes the recitation of the biblical instruction to \"blot out the remembrance [or name] of Amalek\". Scholars \u2013 including [[Ian Lustick]], [[Marc Gopin]], and [[Steven Bayme]] \u2013 state that the violence described in the [[Book of Esther]] has inspired and incited violent acts and violent attitudes in the post-biblical era, continuing into modern times, often centered on the festival of [[Purim]].<ref name=\"Horowitz 2006\"/>{{rp|2\u201319, 107\u2013146, 187\u2013212, 213\u2013247}}<ref>[[Ian Lustick|Lustick, Ian]], ''For the land and the Lord: Jewish fundamentalism in Israel'', Council on Foreign Relations, 1988. Quote: \"Of decisive importance to Jewish fundamentalists is their belief that contemporary political developments are part of an unfolding cosmic drama that will determine, depending on the willingness of Jews to act decisively on its behalf, whether God's redemption of his people Israel, and of the whole world, will or will not soon reach its completion\u2026. The massacre in the Hebron mosque on the Jewish holiday of Purim is a tragic, but telling, example. Preceded by a rash of killings of Jewish settlers by Muslim fundamentalists \u2026 it is not in the least a coincidence that the massacre took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim. For most Jews Purim means listening to .. the Book of Esther .. .It is an occasion for merry-making, games, charity and the exchange of gifts. But as Goldstein sat reading that same book on Purim even in 1994, it is almost certain he identified Yasir Arafat with Haman, the arch-enemy of the Jews of ancient Persia, and the killing of Jewish settlers over the previous months with Haman's murderous designs. Accordingly, he [Goldstein] focused on often-ignored verses at the end of the book [of Esther] which, for Jewish fundamentalists, capture the essence of the story under contemporary circumstances and contain a divine imperative to act. According to the Book of Esther the Jews are saved by the king who reverses Haman's evil decree and declares instead that Jews may do unto their enemies what their enemies had intended to do unto them 'to stand up for themselves, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might assault them, with their little ones and women' (Esther 8:11)\u2026.By mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was re-enacting part of the Purim story.\" (pp. ix\u2013xi.)</ref><ref>Quotes from Horowitz 2006, p. 16: \"This book deals not only with the theme of Amalek and responses \u2013 Christian as well as Jewish \u2013 to the book of Esther over the centuries, but also with Jewish violence connected with the holiday of Purim, from the early fifth century to the late twentieth.\"\n:p. 19: \"The first [part of this book] is devoted .. to the book of Esther \u2026 Was it a book that promoted cruel vengeance\u2026? Since according to Jewish law the Amalekites, including women and children, had to be utterly destroyed, thinking about Amalek involved \u2026 thinking about the possibilities of, and justifications for, Jewish violence. [The second part of this book includes discussion of] one specific form of Jewish violence over many centuries - the descration of the cross and other Christian images\u2026. [chapter 8 is] devoted to violence against Christians, sometimes within the context of the Purim festiviy, in the 5th\u20137th centuries. Chapter 9 carries the subject of Purim violence into the medieval and early modern Europe, especially against the background of the often violent rites of Carnival.\"</ref>\n<ref>[[Steven Bayme|Bayme, Steven]], \"Saddam, Haman, and Amalek\", in ''Jewish arguments and counterarguments: essays and addresses'', KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2002: Quote: \"For many centuries Purim has been a source of both joy and embarrassment for Jews. \u2026 Still others have challenged the doctrine of violence associated with the holiday\u2026 Martin Luther, for one, accused the Jews of bloodthirsty and vengeful spirit in the Book of Esther\u2026 [Luther] reflect[s] the close association of Purim with the biblical doctrine of war against the Amalek. The theme of Jewish violence against Haman and his supporters, the doctrine of Amalek, has caused Jews the greatest discomfort with the Book of Esther and the holiday with which it is associated\u2026. Judaism teaches that violence is justified under certain circumstances \u2013 particularly defense against aggression \u2026 Amalek, the rabbis argue, is the eternally irreconcilable enemy who represents a value system that promotes murder \u2026 Herein lies the enduring relevance of Purim. Aggression must be stopped and evil eliminated\u2026. The meaning of Purim is relevant to the question of the war in the Persian Gulf today [2002]\u2026.

Quote:\"Jews and Christians have also been troubled by the story's [Book of Esther] enthusiastic account of the violence of the Jewish community's response to their enemies, which involved not only self defense but also the slaughter of women and children, including the sons of Haman. The bloodthirsty language, however, derives from the story's symmetric pattern of reversals..\" (p. 708)</ref>\n<ref>[[Marc Gopin|Gopin, Marc]], ''Between Eden and Armageddon: the future of world religions, violence, and peacemaking'', Oxford University Press US, 2000. Quote : \"I have known many Orthodox rabbis, for example, who would be happy to ensure that a holiday such as Purim, with its obligatory reading of the Book of Esther, which cluminates with the slaughter of the people \u2013 including their children \u2013 who tried to exterminate the Jewish people, would never be used to justify the killing of anyone today. They certainly are deeply ashamed by Baruch Goldstein's mass murder at the Hebron mosque, which was inspired in part by Purim\u2026. They can and do give moralistic sermons, and they can and do interpret the story in less violent terms\u2026. The hermeneutic give and take of Purim is but one example of the way in which a deeply embedded tradition will not disappear even when many people reject its implicit message of violence\u2026. It is not likely [that Purim would diminish in importance] in the current climate of religious revivalism, but it is possible that the violence of the story could be overshadowed with time by the numerous benevolent characteristics of the holiday, such as aiding the poor\u2026. Jewish empowerment allows for a new hermeneutic that could centralize the violence of the story. If the political situation were to rapidly deteriorate, it is conceivable that Purim could become for radical Jews what Ramadan has become for radical Muslims in Algeria, a killing season\u2026. Even the most radically pacifist Jews that I know do not eliminate this holiday, although they do not really know what to do with sacralized violence yet, and are now only evolving a spiritual and ritual reworking of traumatic and violent episodes.\" (pp. 52\u201353)</ref>\n<ref>Nirenberg, David, ''Communities of violence: persecution of minorities in the Middle Ages'', Princeton University Press, 1998.

Twenty-nine Palestinians were killed before the enraged crowd tore him to pieces. It was a shameful day in Jewish history, the memory of which should be injected into all future Purim celebrations as a sober reminder of the potential barbarism that is hidden within the old myths of vengeance wrought by the Sons of Israel upon their enemies\u2026. [Baruch's] memorial plaque affirmed that 'he was murdered for the sanctification of the Name\u2026'. In this manipulative phrasing the old Jewish ethos of martyrdom, the sanctification of the Name, was given new meaning - messianic, activist, and murderous\u2026. Purim celebrations in Israel in 2001 were again blotted by ugly incidents. As Jewish hotheadedness increased \u2026 harassments of Palestinians took place. During Purim it was a mitzvah, or good deed, to sock it to the modern Amalekites\u2026 In Jerusalem dozens of Jews gathered in the Sabath Square, pelted cars with stones, tried to set a minibus on fire, and threw various objects at residents of the Arab quarter. In Zion Gate Jews beat up Palestinians, calling them 'dirty Arabs' and 'terrorists'. One drunken Jew who wounded an Arab in the eye subsequently attacked the police as he was arrested. There was no loss of life in these incidents, but this cannot be said about the Baruch Goldstein precedence of violence that was deliberately injected into the Purim ritual. And if it has become a Purim commandment to drink and then attack Arabs, how should the Arabs react?\" (pp. 63\u201364)</ref>\n<ref>Robins, Robert S. and Post, Jerrold M., ''Political paranoia: the psychopolitics of hatred'', Yale University Press, 1997.

For example, the speeches and letter of Chaim Weizman, the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' \u2026 describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found \u2026' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder.

The timing of his attack the next day at the same site hardly seems the product of happenstance or coincidence. It was the day of Purim. Moreover, although his actions seemed to be the product of a mind that had snapped or become depraved, there did not seem to be any sign that he was suffering from a mental disorder. His actions were deliberate and intentional. Goldstein was troubled by the ongoing peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in Oslo and openly concerned that a Palestinian state was about to be created. His attack on Muslim worshippers at the same site, while Purim coincided with Ramadan, was an attempt to cast himself symbolically in the story as Mordecai. Indeed that was exactly the way his actions were interpreted by other settlers at Kiryat Arba, and in the years to come after 1994, there would be numerous instances in which the settlers would celebrate Purim by also invoking Goldstein's memory and image in a provocative manner. }}</ref><ref name=times940307>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980291-1,00.html |title=When Fury Rules |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 7, 1994 | access-date=2010-04-28}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/settlers-remember-gunman-goldstein-hebron-riots-continue-1.263834 ''Settlers remember gunman Goldstein; Hebron riots continue''].

Quote: \"Of decisive importance to Jewish fundamentalists is their belief that contemporary political developments are part of an unfolding cosmic drama that will determine, depending on the willingness of Jews to act decisively on its behalf, whether God's redemption of his people Israel, and of the whole world, will or will not soon reach its completion\u2026. The massacre in the Hebron mosque on the Jewish holiday of Purim is a tragic, but telling, example. Preceded by a rash of killings of Jewish settlers by Muslim fundamentalists \u2026 it is not in the least a coincidence that the massacre took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim. For most Jews Purim means listening to .. the Book of Esther .. .It is an occasion for merry-making, games, charity and the exchange of gifts. But as Goldstein sat reading that same book on Purim even in 1994, it is almost certain he identified Yasir Arafat with Haman, the arch-enemy of the Jews of ancient Persia, and the killing of Jewish settlers over the previous months with Haman's murderous designs. Accordingly, he [Goldstein] focused on often-ignored verses at the end of the book [of Esther] which, for Jewish fundamentalists, capture the essence of the story under contemporary circumstances and contain a divine imperative to act. According to the Book of Esther the Jews are saved by the king who reverses Haman's evil decree and declares instead that Jews may do unto their enemies what their enemies had intended to do unto them 'to stand up for themselves, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might assault them, with their little ones and women' (Esther 8:11)\u2026.By mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was re-enacting part of the Purim story.\" (pp. ix\u2013xi.)</ref><ref>Quotes from Horowitz 2006, p. 16: \"This book deals not only with the theme of Amalek and responses \u2013 Christian as well as Jewish \u2013 to the book of Esther over the centuries, but also with Jewish violence connected with the holiday of Purim, from the early fifth century to the late twentieth.\"\n:p. 19: \"The first [part of this book] is devoted .. to the book of Esther \u2026 Was it a book that promoted cruel vengeance\u2026? Since according to Jewish law the Amalekites, including women and children, had to be utterly destroyed, thinking about Amalek involved \u2026 thinking about the possibilities of, and justifications for, Jewish violence. [The second part of this book includes discussion of] one specific form of Jewish violence over many centuries - the descration of the cross and other Christian images\u2026. [chapter 8 is] devoted to violence against Christians, sometimes within the context of the Purim festiviy, in the 5th\u20137th centuries. Chapter 9 carries the subject of Purim violence into the medieval and early modern Europe, especially against the background of the often violent rites of Carnival.\"</ref>\n<ref>[[Steven Bayme|Bayme, Steven]], \"Saddam, Haman, and Amalek\", in ''Jewish arguments and counterarguments: essays and addresses'', KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2002: Quote: \"For many centuries Purim has been a source of both joy and embarrassment for Jews. \u2026 Still others have challenged the doctrine of violence associated with the holiday\u2026 Martin Luther, for one, accused the Jews of bloodthirsty and vengeful spirit in the Book of Esther\u2026 [Luther] reflect[s] the close association of Purim with the biblical doctrine of war against the Amalek. The theme of Jewish violence against Haman and his supporters, the doctrine of Amalek, has caused Jews the greatest discomfort with the Book of Esther and the holiday with which it is associated\u2026. Judaism teaches that violence is justified under certain circumstances \u2013 particularly defense against aggression \u2026 Amalek, the rabbis argue, is the eternally irreconcilable enemy who represents a value system that promotes murder \u2026 Herein lies the enduring relevance of Purim. Aggression must be stopped and evil eliminated\u2026. The meaning of Purim is relevant to the question of the war in the Persian Gulf today [2002]\u2026.

They certainly are deeply ashamed by Baruch Goldstein's mass murder at the Hebron mosque, which was inspired in part by Purim\u2026. They can and do give moralistic sermons, and they can and do interpret the story in less violent terms\u2026. The hermeneutic give and take of Purim is but one example of the way in which a deeply embedded tradition will not disappear even when many people reject its implicit message of violence\u2026. It is not likely [that Purim would diminish in importance] in the current climate of religious revivalism, but it is possible that the violence of the story could be overshadowed with time by the numerous benevolent characteristics of the holiday, such as aiding the poor\u2026. Jewish empowerment allows for a new hermeneutic that could centralize the violence of the story. If the political situation were to rapidly deteriorate, it is conceivable that Purim could become for radical Jews what Ramadan has become for radical Muslims in Algeria, a killing season\u2026.

In Zion Gate Jews beat up Palestinians, calling them 'dirty Arabs' and 'terrorists'. One drunken Jew who wounded an Arab in the eye subsequently attacked the police as he was arrested.

For example, the speeches and letter of Chaim Weizman, the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' \u2026 describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found \u2026' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder.

The timing of his attack the next day at the same site hardly seems the product of happenstance or coincidence. It was the day of Purim. Moreover, although his actions seemed to be the product of a mind that had snapped or become depraved, there did not seem to be any sign that he was suffering from a mental disorder. His actions were deliberate and intentional. Goldstein was troubled by the ongoing peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in Oslo and openly concerned that a Palestinian state was about to be created. His attack on Muslim worshippers at the same site, while Purim coincided with Ramadan, was an attempt to cast himself symbolically in the story as Mordecai. Indeed that was exactly the way his actions were interpreted by other settlers at Kiryat Arba, and in the years to come after 1994, there would be numerous instances in which the settlers would celebrate Purim by also invoking Goldstein's memory and image in a provocative manner. }}</ref><ref name=times940307>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980291-1,00.html |title=When Fury Rules |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 7, 1994 | access-date=2010-04-28}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/settlers-remember-gunman-goldstein-hebron-riots-continue-1.263834 ''Settlers remember gunman Goldstein; Hebron riots continue''].

It stars [[Carol Kane]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Tony Beckley]] and [[Charles Durning]]. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of \"[[the babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\n\nThe film has developed a large [[cult following]] over time because of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest openings in movie history. The first 12 minutes of [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' is an homage to the opening of ''When a Stranger Calls''.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 26, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was commercially successful, grossing $21,411,158 at the box office. It received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was followed by the 1993 [[Television film|made-for-cable]] sequel ''[[When a Stranger Calls Back]]'' and [[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|a remake]] in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nJill Johnson ([[Carol Kane]]) is babysitting the children of Dr. Mandrakis ([[Carmen Argenziano]]) at his home. When the children are asleep, Jill receives a [[Landline|telephone]] call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. Jill initially dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who tell Jill to keep the caller on the line long enough for them to trace the call. Jill receives one final call from her stalker. Immediately after the conversation, the police phone to inform her that the calls are coming from a phone inside the house. Jill runs to the door as a light comes on at the top of the staircase, and the stalker's shadow appears. The scene [[segue]]s to a close-up of detective John Clifford ([[Charles Durning]]), who is the investigating the matter. Patrol officer Charlie Garber ([[Ron O'Neal]]) explains that Jill is unharmed, but the children were murdered by the perpetrator several hours earlier, before Jill's ordeal even started. The killer is identified as an [[England|English]] [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] named Curt Duncan ([[Tony Beckley]]), who is subsequently sent to an asylum.\n\nSeven years later, Duncan escapes from the asylum. Dr. Mandrakis hires Clifford, now a [[private investigator]], to find Duncan. Not knowing Clifford is after him, Duncan is now a homeless, vagrant loner. He is beaten after disturbing a woman, Tracy ([[Colleen Dewhurst]]), in a downtown bar, and later follows her to her apartment. Feeling sorry for his appearance and her involuntary role in the beating, Tracy tries to be nice to the man while getting him to leave, hoping this will be the last she sees of him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly obsessed Clifford confides to his friend (now Lieutenant) Garber his intention to kill Duncan rather than arrest him. Garber, who was also present in the Mandrakis crime scene, agrees to collaborate. Clifford follows the trail to the bar where Duncan was beaten, and from there to Tracy's residence. Clifford tells Tracy just how dangerous her situation has become, revealing that Duncan had literally torn apart the Mandrakis children with his bare hands. Tracy reluctantly agrees to be Clifford's bait at the bar that evening should Duncan reappear. Clifford surreptitiously follows Tracy from the bar to her apartment, but sees no sign of Duncan.  After Clifford leaves, however, Duncan comes out of hiding from inside Tracy\u2019s closet. Tracy screams for help. Clifford returns and chases Duncan away from the scene, losing his trail in the streets of [[downtown Los Angeles]].\n\nJill Lockart (n\u00e9e Johnson) is now married with two young children. One night, she and her husband Stephen (Steven Anderson) go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion, while their children are babysat by Sharon (Lenora May). At the restaurant, Jill gets a telephone call and hears Duncan's voice again: \"Have you checked the children?\". She panics and calls Sharon; nothing seems to be wrong at first, but then the call is suddenly disconnected. The police escort Jill back home to discover that everything there is fine. Clifford is tipped off by Garber, however, and tries to call Jill, but finds that the line is disconnected. Later that night, Jill goes downstairs for a glass of milk when the lights suddenly go out. She returns to bed and hears Duncan's voice as the closet door appears to open. Jill tries shaking her husband awake only to realize that the man lying next to her is Duncan. Duncan chases Jill across the room and attempts to kill her when Clifford arrives and fatally shoots Duncan. Jill\u2019s husband Stephen is revealed to be in the closet, unconscious but alive. Their children are safe. As Clifford comforts Jill, the last view is of the house, superimposed beneath the eyes of Curt Duncan.\n\n==Cast== \n{{div col}}\n* [[Charles Durning]] as John Clifford\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Jill Johnson\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Tracy Fuller\n* [[Tony Beckley]] as Curt Duncan\n* [[Carmen Argenziano]] as Dr. Mandrakis\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Mrs. Mandrakis\n* [[William Boyett]] as Sgt.

However, CARA chair [[Richard Heffner]] then viewed the film and called the board for further discussion to consider voting for an R rating instead. Although the theme of a film could potentially be accommodated within a PG rating, Heffner argued that this film's treatment of its theme was too unsettling for most parents to want it to be freely available to unaccompanied children.

It stars [[Carol Kane]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Tony Beckley]] and [[Charles Durning]]. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of \"[[the babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\n\nThe film has developed a large [[cult following]] over time because of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest openings in movie history. The opening sequence was highly influential for the horror genre and was paid homage to in [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' in the latter film's opening 12 minutes.\n\n''When a Stranger Calls'' was released in the United States on October 26, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film was commercially successful, grossing $21,411,158 at the box office, though it received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was followed by the 1993 [[Television film|made-for-cable]] sequel ''[[When a Stranger Calls Back]]'' and [[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|a remake]] in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nJill Johnson ([[Carol Kane]]) is babysitting the children of Dr. Mandrakis ([[Carmen Argenziano]]) at his home. When the children are asleep, Jill receives a [[Landline|telephone]] call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. Jill initially dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who tell Jill to keep the caller on the line long enough for them to trace the call. Jill receives one final call from her stalker. Immediately after the conversation, the police phone to inform her that the calls are coming from a phone inside the house. Jill runs to the door as a light comes on at the top of the staircase, and the stalker's shadow appears. The scene [[segue]]s to a close-up of detective John Clifford ([[Charles Durning]]), who is the investigating the matter. Patrol officer Charlie Garber ([[Ron O'Neal]]) explains that Jill is unharmed, but the children were murdered by the perpetrator several hours earlier, before Jill's ordeal even started. The killer is identified as an [[England|English]] [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] named Curt Duncan ([[Tony Beckley]]), who is subsequently sent to an asylum.\n\nSeven years later, Duncan escapes from the asylum. Dr. Mandrakis hires Clifford, now a [[private investigator]], to find Duncan. Not knowing Clifford is after him, Duncan is now a homeless, vagrant loner. He is beaten after disturbing a woman, Tracy ([[Colleen Dewhurst]]), in a downtown bar, and later follows her to her apartment. Feeling sorry for his appearance and her involuntary role in the beating, Tracy tries to be nice to the man while getting him to leave, hoping this will be the last she sees of him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly obsessed Clifford confides to his friend (now Lieutenant) Garber his intention to kill Duncan rather than arrest him. Garber, who was also present in the Mandrakis crime scene, agrees to collaborate. Clifford follows the trail to the bar where Duncan was beaten, and from there to Tracy's residence. Clifford tells Tracy just how dangerous her situation has become, revealing that Duncan had literally torn apart the Mandrakis children with his bare hands. Tracy reluctantly agrees to be Clifford's bait at the bar that evening should Duncan reappear. Clifford surreptitiously follows Tracy from the bar to her apartment, but sees no sign of Duncan.  After Clifford leaves, however, Duncan comes out of hiding from inside Tracy\u2019s closet. Tracy screams for help. Clifford returns and chases Duncan away from the scene, losing his trail in the streets of [[downtown Los Angeles]].\n\nJill Lockart (n\u00e9e Johnson) is now married with two young children. One night, she and her husband Stephen (Steven Anderson) go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion, while their children are babysat by Sharon (Lenora May). At the restaurant, Jill gets a telephone call and hears Duncan's voice again: \"Have you checked the children?\". She panics and calls Sharon; nothing seems to be wrong at first, but then the call is suddenly disconnected. The police escort Jill back home to discover that everything there is fine. Clifford is tipped off by Garber, however, and tries to call Jill, but finds that the line is disconnected. Later that night, Jill goes downstairs for a glass of milk when the lights suddenly go out. She returns to bed and hears Duncan's voice as the closet door appears to open. Jill tries shaking her husband awake only to realize that the man lying next to her is Duncan. Duncan chases Jill across the room and attempts to kill her when Clifford arrives and fatally shoots Duncan. Jill\u2019s husband Stephen is revealed to be in the closet, unconscious but alive. Their children are safe. As Clifford comforts Jill, the last view is of the house, superimposed beneath the eyes of Curt Duncan.\n\n==Cast== \n{{div col}}\n* [[Charles Durning]] as John Clifford\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Jill Johnson\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Tracy Fuller\n* [[Tony Beckley]] as Curt Duncan\n* [[Carmen Argenziano]] as Dr. Mandrakis\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Mrs. Mandrakis\n* [[William Boyett]] as Sgt.

The device that usually holds so much promise for positive communication has become virtually her worst nightmare.<ref name=holt/></blockquote>\n\n===Rating===\nThe Classification and Rating Administration had originally voted unanimously for a PG rating (five years before the PG-13 rating was available for use). However, CARA chair [[Richard Heffner]] then viewed the film and called the board for further discussion to consider voting for an R rating instead. Although the theme of a film could potentially be accommodated within a PG rating, Heffner argued that this film's treatment of its theme was too unsettling for most parents to want it to be freely available to unaccompanied children. A majority vote was then received to assign the film its R rating.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Heffner|date=1979|title=Oral History: transcript volume 10 - 1979}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Home media ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For higher dimensional generalization, see the discussion of [[Hodge decomposition]] [[Helmholtz_decomposition#Fields_with_prescribed_divergence_and_curl|below]].\n\n===Another derivation from the Fourier transform===\nNote that in the theorem stated here, we have imposed the condition that if <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> is not defined on a bounded domain, then <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> shall decay faster than <math>1/r</math>. Thus, the Fourier Transform of <math>\\mathbf{F}</math>, denoted as <math>\\mathbf{G}</math>, is guaranteed to exist. We apply the convention\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\iiint \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k </math>\n\nThe Fourier transform of a scalar field is a scalar field, and the Fourier transform of a vector field is a vector field of same dimension.\n\nNow consider the following scalar and vector fields:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nG_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\frac{\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})}{\\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\frac{\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})}{\\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^2}  \\\\ [8pt]\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) &= \\iiint G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}) &= \\iiint \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nHence\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}) &= - i \\mathbf{k} G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) + i \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ [6pt]\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) &= -\\iiint i \\mathbf{k} G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k + \\iiint i \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\n&= - \\nabla \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) +  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Fields with prescribed divergence and curl==\nThe term \"Helmholtz theorem\" can also refer to the following. Let {{math|'''C'''}} be a [[solenoidal vector field]] and ''d'' a scalar field on {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} which are sufficiently smooth and which vanish faster than {{math|1/''r''<sup>2</sup>}} at infinity. Then there exists a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} such that\n\n: <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = d \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{C};</math>\n\nif additionally the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} vanishes as {{math|''r'' \u2192 \u221e}}, then {{math|'''F'''}} is unique.<ref name=\"griffiths\"/>\n\nIn other words, a vector field can be constructed with both a specified divergence and a specified curl, and if it also vanishes at infinity, it is uniquely specified by its divergence and curl. This theorem is of great importance in [[electrostatics]], since [[Maxwell's equations]] for the electric and magnetic fields in the static case are of exactly this type.<ref name=\"griffiths\"/> The proof is by a construction generalizing the one given above: we set\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = - \\nabla(\\mathcal{G} (d)) + \\nabla \\times (\\mathcal{G}(\\mathbf{C})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> represents the [[Newtonian potential]] operator. (When acting on a vector field, such as {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''F'''}}, it is defined to act on each component.)\n\n==Differential forms==\nThe [[Hodge decomposition#Hodge decomposition|Hodge decomposition]] is closely related to the Helmholtz decomposition, generalizing from vector fields on '''R'''<sup>3</sup> to [[differential forms]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M''.  Most formulations of the Hodge decomposition require ''M'' to be [[compact space|compact]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2695643|title=Vector Calculus and the Topology of Domains in 3-Space| first1=Jason |last1=Cantarella |first2=Dennis |last2=DeTurck |first3=Herman|last3=Gluck|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=109|issue=5|year=2002|pages=409\u2013442|doi=10.2307/2695643 }}</ref> Since this is not true of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the Hodge decomposition theorem is not strictly a generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.  However, the compactness restriction in the usual formulation of the Hodge decomposition can be replaced by suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the differential forms involved,  giving a proper generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.\n\n==Weak formulation==\nThe Helmholtz decomposition can also be generalized by reducing the regularity assumptions (the need for the existence of strong derivatives). Suppose {{math|\u03a9}} is a bounded, simply-connected, [[Lipschitz domain]]. Every [[square-integrable]] vector field {{math|'''u''' \u2208 (''L''<sup>2</sup>(\u03a9))<sup>3</sup>}} has an [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] decomposition:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}=\\nabla\\varphi+\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c6}} is in the [[Sobolev space]] {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9)}} of square-integrable functions on {{math|\u03a9}} whose partial derivatives defined in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense are square integrable, and {{math|'''A''' \u2208 ''H''(curl, \u03a9)}}, the Sobolev space of vector fields consisting of square integrable vector fields with square integrable curl.\n\nFor a slightly smoother vector field {{math|'''u''' \u2208 ''H''(curl, \u03a9)}}, a similar decomposition holds:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}=\\nabla\\varphi+\\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c6'' \u2208 ''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9), '''v''' \u2208 (''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9))<sup>''d''</sup>}}.\n\n==Longitudinal and transverse fields==\nA terminology often used in physics refers to the curl-free component of a vector field as the '''longitudinal component''' and the divergence-free component as the '''transverse component'''.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0335 Stewart, A. M.; Longitudinal and transverse components of a vector field, Sri Lankan Journal of Physics 12, 33\u201342 (2011)]</ref> This terminology comes from the following construction: Compute the three-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] <math>\\hat\\mathbf{F}</math> of the vector field <math>\\mathbf{F}</math>. Then decompose this field, at each point '''k''', into two components, one of which points longitudinally, i.e. parallel to '''k''', the other of which points in the transverse direction, i.e. perpendicular to '''k'''. So far, we have\n\n: <math>\\hat\\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{k}) = \\hat\\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{k}) + \\hat\\mathbf{F}_l (\\mathbf{k})</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat\\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{k}) = 0.</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{k} \\times \\hat\\mathbf{F}_l(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{0}.</math>\n\nNow we apply an inverse Fourier transform to each of these components. Using properties of Fourier transforms, we derive:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{r})+\\mathbf{F}_l(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n: <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{r}) = 0</math>\n: <math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}_l (\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}</math>\n\nSince <math>\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\Phi)=0</math> and <math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})=0</math>,\n\nwe can get\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_t=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\nabla\\times\\int_V\\frac{\\nabla'\\times\\mathbf{F}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\mathrm{d}V'</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_l=-\\nabla\\Phi=-\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\nabla\\int_V\\frac{\\nabla'\\cdot\\mathbf{F}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\mathrm{d}V'</math>\n\nso this is indeed the Helmholtz decomposition.<ref>[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hamclassemf.pdf Online lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clebsch representation]] for a related decomposition of vector fields\n* [[Darwin Lagrangian]] for an application\n* [[Poloidal\u2013toroidal decomposition]] for a further decomposition of the divergence-free component <math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} </math>.\n* [[Scalar-vector-tensor decomposition]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[George B.

for example, in two dimensions it should be replaced by <math>\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|</math>. For higher dimensional generalization, see the discussion of [[Hodge decomposition]] [[Helmholtz_decomposition#Fields_with_prescribed_divergence_and_curl|below]].\n\n===Another derivation from the Fourier transform===\nNote that in the theorem stated here, we have imposed the condition that if <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> is not defined on a bounded domain, then <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> shall decay faster than <math>1/r</math>. Thus, the Fourier Transform of <math>\\mathbf{F}</math>, denoted as <math>\\mathbf{G}</math>, is guaranteed to exist. We apply the convention\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\iiint \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k </math>\n\nThe Fourier transform of a scalar field is a scalar field, and the Fourier transform of a vector field is a vector field of same dimension.\n\nNow consider the following scalar and vector fields:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nG_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\frac{\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})}{\\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\frac{\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k})}{\\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^2}  \\\\ [8pt]\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) &= \\iiint G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}) &= \\iiint \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nHence\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{k}) &= - i \\mathbf{k} G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) + i \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ [6pt]\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) &= -\\iiint i \\mathbf{k} G_\\Phi(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k + \\iiint i \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{G}_\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\n&= - \\nabla \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) +  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Fields with prescribed divergence and curl==\nThe term \"Helmholtz theorem\" can also refer to the following. Let {{math|'''C'''}} be a [[solenoidal vector field]] and ''d'' a scalar field on {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} which are sufficiently smooth and which vanish faster than {{math|1/''r''<sup>2</sup>}} at infinity. Then there exists a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} such that\n\n: <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = d \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{C};</math>\n\nif additionally the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} vanishes as {{math|''r'' \u2192 \u221e}}, then {{math|'''F'''}} is unique.<ref name=\"griffiths\"/>\n\nIn other words, a vector field can be constructed with both a specified divergence and a specified curl, and if it also vanishes at infinity, it is uniquely specified by its divergence and curl. This theorem is of great importance in [[electrostatics]], since [[Maxwell's equations]] for the electric and magnetic fields in the static case are of exactly this type.<ref name=\"griffiths\"/> The proof is by a construction generalizing the one given above: we set\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = - \\nabla(\\mathcal{G} (d)) + \\nabla \\times (\\mathcal{G}(\\mathbf{C})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> represents the [[Newtonian potential]] operator. (When acting on a vector field, such as {{math|\u2207 \u00d7 '''F'''}}, it is defined to act on each component.)\n\n==Differential forms==\nThe [[Hodge decomposition#Hodge decomposition|Hodge decomposition]] is closely related to the Helmholtz decomposition, generalizing from vector fields on '''R'''<sup>3</sup> to [[differential forms]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M''.  Most formulations of the Hodge decomposition require ''M'' to be [[compact space|compact]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2695643|title=Vector Calculus and the Topology of Domains in 3-Space| first1=Jason |last1=Cantarella |first2=Dennis |last2=DeTurck |first3=Herman|last3=Gluck|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=109|issue=5|year=2002|pages=409\u2013442|doi=10.2307/2695643 }}</ref> Since this is not true of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the Hodge decomposition theorem is not strictly a generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.  However, the compactness restriction in the usual formulation of the Hodge decomposition can be replaced by suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the differential forms involved,  giving a proper generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.\n\n==Weak formulation==\nThe Helmholtz decomposition can also be generalized by reducing the regularity assumptions (the need for the existence of strong derivatives). Suppose {{math|\u03a9}} is a bounded, simply-connected, [[Lipschitz domain]]. Every [[square-integrable]] vector field {{math|'''u''' \u2208 (''L''<sup>2</sup>(\u03a9))<sup>3</sup>}} has an [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] decomposition:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}=\\nabla\\varphi+\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c6}} is in the [[Sobolev space]] {{math|''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9)}} of square-integrable functions on {{math|\u03a9}} whose partial derivatives defined in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense are square integrable, and {{math|'''A''' \u2208 ''H''(curl, \u03a9)}}, the Sobolev space of vector fields consisting of square integrable vector fields with square integrable curl.\n\nFor a slightly smoother vector field {{math|'''u''' \u2208 ''H''(curl, \u03a9)}}, a similar decomposition holds:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}=\\nabla\\varphi+\\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c6'' \u2208 ''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9), '''v''' \u2208 (''H''<sup>1</sup>(\u03a9))<sup>''d''</sup>}}.\n\n==Longitudinal and transverse fields==\nA terminology often used in physics refers to the curl-free component of a vector field as the '''longitudinal component''' and the divergence-free component as the '''transverse component'''.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0335 Stewart, A. M.; Longitudinal and transverse components of a vector field, Sri Lankan Journal of Physics 12, 33\u201342 (2011)]</ref> This terminology comes from the following construction: Compute the three-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] <math>\\hat\\mathbf{F}</math> of the vector field <math>\\mathbf{F}</math>. Then decompose this field, at each point '''k''', into two components, one of which points longitudinally, i.e. parallel to '''k''', the other of which points in the transverse direction, i.e. perpendicular to '''k'''. So far, we have\n\n: <math>\\hat\\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{k}) = \\hat\\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{k}) + \\hat\\mathbf{F}_l (\\mathbf{k})</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat\\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{k}) = 0.</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{k} \\times \\hat\\mathbf{F}_l(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{0}.</math>\n\nNow we apply an inverse Fourier transform to each of these components. Using properties of Fourier transforms, we derive:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{r})+\\mathbf{F}_l(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n: <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{r}) = 0</math>\n: <math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}_l (\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}</math>\n\nSince <math>\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\Phi)=0</math> and <math>\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})=0</math>,\n\nwe can get\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_t=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\nabla\\times\\int_V\\frac{\\nabla'\\times\\mathbf{F}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\mathrm{d}V'</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_l=-\\nabla\\Phi=-\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\nabla\\int_V\\frac{\\nabla'\\cdot\\mathbf{F}}{\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|}\\mathrm{d}V'</math>\n\nso this is indeed the Helmholtz decomposition.<ref>[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hamclassemf.pdf Online lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clebsch representation]] for a related decomposition of vector fields\n* [[Darwin Lagrangian]] for an application\n* [[Poloidal\u2013toroidal decomposition]] for a further decomposition of the divergence-free component <math> \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} </math>.\n* [[Scalar-vector-tensor decomposition]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[George B.
