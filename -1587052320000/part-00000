Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.\n\nPoopoo\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Poo temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.\n\n==Temperatures==\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Africa temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

He integrated his exuberant personality, a vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. He was home-schooled, and he began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending [[Harvard College]]. His book ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' (1882) established his reputation as a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in [[New York State Legislature|New York's state legislature]]. His wife and his mother both died in rapid succession, and he escaped to a cattle ranch in the Dakotas. He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[William McKinley]], but he resigned from that post to lead the [[Rough Riders]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], returning a war hero. He was elected governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1898. After Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died in 1899, the New York state party leadership convinced McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his running mate in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously, and the McKinley\u2013Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservation.\n\nRoosevelt took office as vice president in March 1901 and assumed the presidency at age 42 after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley was assassinated]] the following September. He remains the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|youngest person to become President of the United States]]. Roosevelt was a leader of the progressive movement, and he championed his \"[[Square Deal]]\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of [[Trust (business)|trusts]], regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He made conservation a top priority and established many new [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], [[List of U.S. National Forests|forests]], and [[List of National Monuments of the United States|monuments]] intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he [[Roosevelt Corollary|focused on Central America]] where he began construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. He expanded the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to broker the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] won him the 1906 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He avoided controversial tariff and money issues. Roosevelt was elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] and continued to promote progressive policies, many of which were passed in Congress. He groomed his close friend [[William Howard Taft]] to successfully succeed him in the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]].\n\nRoosevelt grew frustrated with Taft's brand of conservatism and belatedly tried to win the [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|1912 Republican nomination for president]]. He failed, walked out, and founded the so-called [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|\"Bull Moose\" Party]] which called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. He ran in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] and the split allowed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Woodrow Wilson]] to win the election. Following the defeat, Roosevelt led a [[Roosevelt\u2013Rondon Scientific Expedition|two-year expedition to the Amazon basin]] where he nearly died of tropical disease. During [[World War I]], he criticized Wilson for keeping the country out of the war with Germany, and his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. He considered running for president again in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], but his health continued to deteriorate and he died in 1919.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:TR Age 11 Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Theodore Roosevelt at age 11]]\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Theodore Roosevelt.svg|thumb|left|upright|Roosevelt's coat of arms, featuring a rose bush in reference to the name: \"Roosevelt\", which is Dutch for \"rose field\"<ref>{{Citation|last=McMillan |first=Joseph |url=http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt |title=Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 26th and 32nd Presidents of the United States |publisher=American Heraldry Society |date=October 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230095848/http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}</ref> making these an example of [[canting arms]].|alt=|238x238px]]\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|28 East 20th Street]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].{{sfn|Morris|1979|p=3}} He was the second of four children born to socialite [[Martha Bulloch Roosevelt|Martha Stewart \"Mittie\" Bulloch]] and businessman and philanthropist [[Theodore Roosevelt Sr.]] (brother of [[Robert Roosevelt]] and [[James A.

Platt disliked Roosevelt personally, feared that Roosevelt would oppose Platt's interests in office, and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics. However, Platt also needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, [[Frank S.

Platt insisted that he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with Platt's approval. He even enlisted Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called \"superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America\".{{Sfn | Chessman | 1965 | p = 79}}\n\nChessman argues that as governor, Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society.{{Sfn | Chessman | 1965 | p = 6}} Roosevelt sought to position himself against the excesses of large corporations on the one hand and radical movements on the other.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 322}}\n\nAs the chief executive of the most populous state in the union, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as [[William Allen White]] encouraged him to run for president.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 331\u2013333}} Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900, and was denied his preferred post of Secretary of War.

Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 338}} Roosevelt attended the [[1900 Republican National Convention]] as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination for vice president if the convention offered it to him, but would otherwise serve another term as governor.

In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his energy to the public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported the war itself, but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism, which would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With the nation basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 388\u2013405}}<ref>John M.

Roosevelt was vacationing in [[Vermont]], and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so Roosevelt resumed his vacation in the [[Adirondacks]]. When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt again traveled to Buffalo. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt was informed while he was in [[North Creek, New York|North Creek]]; he continued on to Buffalo and was sworn in as the nation's 26th president at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Ansley Wilcox House]].<ref name=Miller/>\n\nRoosevelt's accession to the presidency left the vice presidency vacant. As there was no constitutional provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in that office (prior to [[ratification]] of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] in 1967), Roosevelt served his first term without a vice president. McKinley's supporters were nervous about the new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 354\u2013356}}\n\nShortly after taking office, Roosevelt invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to dinner at the [[White House]]. To his dismay, this sparked a bitter, and at times vicious, reaction across the heavily [[Racial segregation|segregated]] South. Roosevelt reacted with astonishment and protest, saying that he looked forward to many future dinners with Washington.

While Congress was receptive to Department of Commerce and Labor, it was more skeptical of the antitrust powers that Roosevelt sought to endow within the Bureau of Corporations. Roosevelt successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass Roosevelt's version of the bill.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 378\u2013381}}\n\nIn a moment of frustration, House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] commented on Roosevelt's desire for executive branch control in domestic policy-making: \"That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.\" Biographer Brands states, \"Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn't any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve.\"{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 552\u201353}} In fact, Roosevelt's willingness to exercise his power included attempted rule changes in the game of football; at the Naval Academy, he sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules. He even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design he disliked, and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words, according to reformers on the [[Simplified Spelling Board]].

Land fraud and speculation were found involving Oregon federal timberlands. In November 1902, Roosevelt and Secretary [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] forced [[Binger Hermann]], the General Land Office Commissioner, to resign from office. On November 6, 1903 [[Francis J. Heney]] was appointed special prosecutor and obtained 146 indictments involving an [[Oregon]] Land Office bribery ring. U.S. Senator [[John H.

In the 1906 [[Hepburn Act]], Roosevelt sought to give the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative [[Nelson Aldrich]] fought back.

Roosevelt and Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was \"reasonable.\"{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 453\u2013459}}<ref>John Morton Blum, ''The Republican Roosevelt'' (2nd ed. 1977) pp 89\u2013117</ref> In addition to rate-setting, the [[Hepburn Act]] also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445\u2013448</ref>\n\n====Pure food and drugs====\nRoosevelt responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'', published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 459\u2013460}} The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped.

When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty|treaty]] with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 482\u201386}} Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.4|1903|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) for the rights and equipment to build the canal.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}} Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a January 8, 1906 message to Congress. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the New York ''World'' and the Indianapolis ''News'' known as the \"Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases\".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=209\u2013210}} Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld the lower courts' rulings.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=213\u2013214}} Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the ''World'' and the ''News'', but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the Panama Canal took place.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=215}}\n\nIn 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines if necessary, without congressional approval.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 570}}\n\nExamining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard (2014) reports that:\n\n<blockquote>The most striking evolution in the twenty-first century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist....

While out of office, he made a living as a writer and magazine editor. He loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. He drew the line, however, at expose-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, set magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but his speech in 1906 coined the term \"[[muckraker]]\" for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. \"The liar\", he said, \"is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves.\"<ref>{{cite book | first1=Arthur | last1 = Weinberg| first2=Lila Shaffer | last2 = Weinberg|title=The Muckrakers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMFrIZ68gwC&pg=PA59 |year=1961|publisher= University of Illinois Press | pages = 58\u201366| isbn = 9780252069864}}</ref>\n\nThe press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. After 1904, he was periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. According to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, near the end of his term, demanded that the Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer's ''New York World''. The publication had accused him of \"deliberate misstatements of fact\" in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court\u2014it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in the state courts.

Roosevelt and Hanna frequently cooperated during Roosevelt's first term, but Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to Roosevelt for the 1904 Republican nomination. Roosevelt and Ohio's other Senator, [[Joseph B. Foraker]], forced Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse Roosevelt for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p = 436-437}} Unwilling to break with the president, Hanna was forced to publicly endorse Roosevelt. Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p = 437\u2013438}} In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to [[Cornelius Bliss]], but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his own man, [[George B. Cortelyou]] of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor.

In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a [[postal savings system]] (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.<ref>Ricard, ed.

A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor [[Charles N. Haskell]] of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his Secretary of Interior [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the [[Osage Nation|Osage lands]] to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York ''Sun'' made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.15|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) after Roosevelt's alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell's allegation as \"a lie, pure and simple\" and obtained a denial from Treasury Secretary [[L. M.

Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. He personally favored Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] as his successor, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 483\u2013485}} Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote the following to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!\" Just weeks later he branded as \"false and malicious\"; the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 626}} At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 488\u2013489}}\n\nIn the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 election]], Taft easily defeated the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1902605|title = William Howard Taft and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 50|issue = 3|pages = 424\u2013442|last1 = Solvick|first1 = Stanley D.|year = 1963|doi = 10.2307/1902605}}</ref>\n\n===Africa and Europe (1909\u20131910)===\n[[File:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt standing next to the elephant he shot on safari]]\n\nIn March 1909, shortly after the end of his presidency, Roosevelt left New York for the [[Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition]], a [[safari]] in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]].<ref name=\"Science1908\">{{cite journal|journal=Science|date= December 18, 1908 | volume = 28 | issue = 729 |pages=876\u201377|jstor=1635075|doi= 10.1126/science.28.729.876| title= President Roosevelt's African Trip | pmid = 17743798|bibcode= 1908Sci....28..876. }}</ref> Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]) and traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]].

He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charley]]. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 665\u201366}} Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff when he concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in Congress.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 502\u2013503}} Regarding radicalism and liberalism, Roosevelt wrote a British friend in 1911:\n:Fundamentally it is the radical liberal with whom I sympathize.

Additionally, Roosevelt expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with the president in the White House in June 1910.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 512\u2013513}}\n\nIn August 1910, Roosevelt gained national attention with a speech at [[Osawatomie, Kansas]], which was the most radical of his career and marked his public break with Taft and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program of \"[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]\", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 675}} Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from [[William Barnes Jr.]], Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss, whom he would later confront in the [[Barnes vs. Roosevelt Libel Trial]]. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 515\u2013516}} Roosevelt nonetheless campaigned for the Republicans in the [[1910 United States elections|1910 elections]], in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since the 1890s. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who argued that he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 517}}\n\nThe Republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 683}} Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 518}} Despite skepticism of La Follette's new league, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for ''The Outlook,'' defending what he called \"the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 684}} With Roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912, La Follette declared his own candidacy in June 1911.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 518}} Roosevelt continually criticized Taft after the 1910 elections, and the break between the two men became final after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; Roosevelt was humiliated by this suit because he had personally approved of an acquisition that the Justice Department was now challenging. However, Roosevelt was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; he instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in 1912.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 519}}\n\n====Dispute over arbitration treaties====\nTaft was a major advocate of arbitration as a major reform of the [[Progressive Era]]. In 1911 Taft and his Secretary of State [[Philander C. Knox]] negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or other tribunal. These were signed in August 1911 but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.<ref>[[David H. Burton]], ''William Howard Taft: Confident Peacemaker'' (2004) pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe arbitration issue opens a window on a bitter philosophical dispute among American progressives. Some, led by Taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice; he had a deep understanding of the legal issues.<ref>John E. Noyes, \"William Howard Taft and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\" ''Villanova Law Review'' 56 (2011): 535+ [https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=vlr online].</ref> Taft's political base was the conservative business community which largely supported peace movements before 1914. However, his mistake in this case was a failure to mobilize that base. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1894200|title = Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 53|issue = 2|pages = 279\u2013298|last1 = Campbell|first1 = John P.|year = 1966|doi = 10.2307/1894200}}</ref>\n\nHowever, an opposing faction of progressives, led by Roosevelt, ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes. Roosevelt worked with his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of the treaties. Lodge thought the treaties impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives.<ref>Robert J. Fischer, \"Henry Cabot Lodge and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\" ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' 78 (Spring 1979): 244-58.</ref> Roosevelt, however, was acting to sabotage Taft's campaign promises.<ref>E.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24443896 online]</ref> At a deeper level, Roosevelt's truly believed that arbitration was a na\u00efve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Rooseveltian approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war.

Garfield and Dan Hanna. This endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined to make a statement\u2014requested by Garfield\u2014that he would flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.\" In January 1912, Roosevelt declared \"if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 698}} Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms\u2014even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 703}} In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives\u2014they are political emotionalists or neurotics\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 709}}\n\nRoosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the Republican Party from defeat in the upcoming presidential election.

These primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt's continuing popularity with the electorate, were not pivotal. The final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee, which was controlled by the party leaders, headed by the incumbent president.\n\nPrior to the [[1912 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Roosevelt expressed doubt about his prospects for victory, noting that Taft had more delegates and control of the credentials committee. His only hope was to convince party leaders that the nomination of Taft would hand the election to the Democrats, but party leaders were determined not to cede their leadership to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 524}} The credentials committee awarded almost all contested delegates to Taft, and Taft won the nomination on the first ballot.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 524\u2013526}} Black delegates from the South played a key role: they voted heavily for Taft and put him over the top.<ref>{{cite book|author=Omar H.

It was later renamed [[Roosevelt River]] in honor of the former president. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his son [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], naturalist Colonel Rondon, George K. Cherrie, sent by the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Brazilian Lieutenant Jo\u00e3o Lira, team physician Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters.

The trip down the River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.<ref name=\"Millard, 2009\"/>\n\nDuring the trip down the river, Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks.

Roosevelt was riddled with chest pains, fighting a fever that soared to {{convert|103|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and at times made him delirious, at one point constantly reciting the first two lines of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem \"[[Kubla Khan]]\": \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree\". Regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others, Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could, preparing to commit suicide with an overdose of [[morphine]].

Upon Roosevelt's return to New York, friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote, perhaps prophetically, to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. For the rest of his few remaining years, he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery.{{Sfn| Thayer | 1919 | pp = 4\u20137}} Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home, critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over {{convert|625|mi|km}} long.

Though he was outraged by the [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]]'s conclusion of a treaty that expressed \"sincere regret\" for the way in which the United States had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many of the reforms passed under Wilson. Roosevelt made several campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the [[1914 United States elections|1914 elections]] were a disaster for the fledgling third party.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 539\u2013540}} Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 548\u2013549}} In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the [[1916 Progressive National Convention]] at the same time as the [[1916 Republican National Convention]].

It became reality along Wilson's lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Roosevelt denounced Wilson's approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations.

Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs's criticisms, and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"yellow journalism of the woods\". It was the President himself who popularized the negative term \"nature faker\" to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism.<ref>{{Citation | last = Carson | first = Gerald |date=February 1971 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/tr-and-%E2%80%9Cnature-fakers%E2%80%9D | title = Roosevelt and the 'nature fakers' | newspaper = American Heritage Magazine | volume = 22 | issue = 2}}.</ref>\n\n==Character and beliefs==\n[[File:SagamoreHill.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sagamore Hill]], Roosevelt's [[Long Island]] estate]]\n\nRoosevelt intensely disliked being called \"Teddy\", despite the widespread public association with said moniker, and was quick to point out this fact to those who referred to him as such, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career.\n\n===Strenuous life===\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called, in an 1899 speech, \"[[The Strenuous Life]]\".

By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards.

He served as the 25th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd [[governor of New York]] from 1899 to 1900. Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and became a driving force for the anti-trust policy while supporting [[Progressive Era]] policies in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on [[Mount Rushmore]] alongside [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He is generally ranked in [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|polls of historians and political scientists]] as one of the five best presidents.<ref>{{cite book| first1 =Robert K | last1 = Murray | first2 = Tim H | last2 = Blessing|title= Greatness in White House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPe7YMR4g1AC&pg=PA9 | year = 2004|publisher= Pennsylvania State U.P.|pages=8\u20139, 15| isbn = 0271038276 }}</ref>\n\nRoosevelt was a sickly child with debilitating [[asthma]], but he overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle, as well as growing out of his asthma naturally in his young adult years. He integrated his exuberant personality, a vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. He was home-schooled, and he began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending [[Harvard College]]. His book ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' (1882) established his reputation as a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in [[New York State Legislature|New York's state legislature]]. His wife and his mother both died in rapid succession, and he escaped to a cattle ranch in the Dakotas. He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[William McKinley]], but he resigned from that post to lead the [[Rough Riders]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], returning a war hero. He was elected governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1898. After Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died in 1899, the New York state party leadership convinced McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his running mate in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously, and the McKinley\u2013Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservation.\n\nRoosevelt took office as vice president in March 1901 and assumed the presidency at age 42 after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley was assassinated]] the following September. He remains the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|youngest person to become President of the United States]]. Roosevelt was a leader of the progressive movement, and he championed his \"[[Square Deal]]\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of [[Trust (business)|trusts]], regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He made conservation a top priority and established many new [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], [[List of U.S. National Forests|forests]], and [[List of National Monuments of the United States|monuments]] intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he [[Roosevelt Corollary|focused on Central America]] where he began construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. He expanded the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to broker the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] won him the 1906 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He avoided controversial tariff and money issues. Roosevelt was elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] and continued to promote progressive policies, many of which were passed in Congress. He groomed his close friend [[William Howard Taft]] to successfully succeed him in the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]].\n\nRoosevelt grew frustrated with Taft's brand of conservatism and belatedly tried to win the [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|1912 Republican nomination for president]]. He failed, walked out, and founded the so-called [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|\"Bull Moose\" Party]] which called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. He ran in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] and the split allowed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Woodrow Wilson]] to win the election.

Roosevelt gave up his earlier plan of studying natural science and instead decided to attend [[Columbia Law School]], moving back into his family's home in New York City.

Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge [[Theodoric R.

Roosevelt fought alongside the [[Mugwump]] reformers; however, Blaine, having gained support from Arthur's and Edmunds's delegates, won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine.

After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give \"hearty support to any decent Democrat\". He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant \"for publication\".{{Sfn | Pringle | 1956 | p = 61}} When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, \"That question I decline to answer.

To throw off his infantry rival, Wheeler left one regiment of his Cavalry Division, the 9th, at Siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong.

Platt disliked Roosevelt personally, feared that Roosevelt would oppose Platt's interests in office, and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics. However, Platt also needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, [[Frank S.

He was exposed to the problems of trusts, monopolies, labor relations, and conservation. Chessman argues that Roosevelt's program \"rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state\".

Platt insisted that he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with Platt's approval. He even enlisted Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called \"superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America\".{{Sfn | Chessman | 1965 | p = 79}}\n\nChessman argues that as governor, Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society.{{Sfn | Chessman | 1965 | p = 6}} Roosevelt sought to position himself against the excesses of large corporations on the one hand and radical movements on the other.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 322}}\n\nAs the chief executive of the most populous state in the union, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as [[William Allen White]] encouraged him to run for president.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 331\u2013333}} Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900, and was denied his preferred post of Secretary of War. As his term progressed, Roosevelt pondered a 1904 presidential run, but was uncertain about whether he should seek re-election as governor in 1900.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 333\u2013334}}\n\n===Vice President===\n{{Main |1900 United States presidential election}}\n\nIn November 1899, Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died of heart failure, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket.

Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 338}} Roosevelt attended the [[1900 Republican National Convention]] as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination for vice president if the convention offered it to him, but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss [[Matthew Quay]] to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 340\u2013341}} Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 342}}\n\nRoosevelt's vice-presidential campaigning proved highly energetic and an equal match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his energy to the public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported the war itself, but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism, which would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With the nation basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 388\u2013405}}<ref>John M.

As there was no constitutional provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in that office (prior to [[ratification]] of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] in 1967), Roosevelt served his first term without a vice president. McKinley's supporters were nervous about the new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 354\u2013356}}\n\nShortly after taking office, Roosevelt invited [[Booker T.

While Congress was receptive to Department of Commerce and Labor, it was more skeptical of the antitrust powers that Roosevelt sought to endow within the Bureau of Corporations. Roosevelt successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass Roosevelt's version of the bill.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 378\u2013381}}\n\nIn a moment of frustration, House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] commented on Roosevelt's desire for executive branch control in domestic policy-making: \"That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.\" Biographer Brands states, \"Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn't any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve.\"{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 552\u201353}} In fact, Roosevelt's willingness to exercise his power included attempted rule changes in the game of football; at the Naval Academy, he sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules. He even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design he disliked, and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words, according to reformers on the [[Simplified Spelling Board]].

Roosevelt investigated and prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated the Creeks and various tribes out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation were found involving Oregon federal timberlands. In November 1902, Roosevelt and Secretary [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] forced [[Binger Hermann]], the General Land Office Commissioner, to resign from office. On November 6, 1903 [[Francis J. Heney]] was appointed special prosecutor and obtained 146 indictments involving an [[Oregon]] Land Office bribery ring. U.S. Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] was indicted for bribery to expedite illegal land patents, found guilty in July 1905, and sentenced to six months in prison.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=207}} More corruption was found in the Postal Department, that brought on the indictments of 44 government employees on charges of bribery and fraud.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=208}} Historians generally agree that Roosevelt moved \"quickly and decisively\" to prosecute misconduct in his administration.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}}\n\n====Railroads====\n{{Main|Hepburn Act}}\nMerchants complained that some railroad rates were too high. In the 1906 [[Hepburn Act]], Roosevelt sought to give the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative [[Nelson Aldrich]] fought back. Roosevelt worked with the Democratic Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] to pass the bill. Roosevelt and Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was \"reasonable.\"{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 453\u2013459}}<ref>John Morton Blum, ''The Republican Roosevelt'' (2nd ed. 1977) pp 89\u2013117</ref> In addition to rate-setting, the [[Hepburn Act]] also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445\u2013448</ref>\n\n====Pure food and drugs====\nRoosevelt responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'', published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 459\u2013460}} The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped.

[[The Great Rapprochement]] had begun with British support of the United States during the Spanish\u2013American War, and it continued as Britain withdrew its fleet from the Caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising [[Anglo-German naval arms race|German naval threat]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 387\u2013388}} In 1901, Britain and the United States signed the [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]], abrogating the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], which had prevented the United States from constructing a canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 399\u2013400}} The long-standing [[Alaska boundary dispute]] was settled on terms favorable to the United States, as Great Britain was unwilling to alienate the United States over what it considered to be a secondary issue.

Roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]]. He succeeded in getting the aggressors to agree to arbitration by a tribunal at [[The Hague]], and averted the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902\u20131903]].{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 464}} The latitude granted to the Europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the \"[[Roosevelt Corollary]]\" to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which the President issued in 1904: \"Chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.\"{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 527}}\n\n[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|left|The U.S.'s intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]] in 1903]]\nThe pursuit of an [[History of the Panama Canal|isthmus canal]] in Central America during this period focused on two possible routes\u2014[[Nicaragua]] and Panama, which was then a rebellious district within [[Colombia]]. Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by the Colombian government. When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty|treaty]] with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 482\u201386}} Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.4|1903|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) for the rights and equipment to build the canal.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}} Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a January 8, 1906 message to Congress. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the New York ''World'' and the Indianapolis ''News'' known as the \"Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases\".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=209\u2013210}} Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld the lower courts' rulings.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=213\u2013214}} Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the ''World'' and the ''News'', but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the Panama Canal took place.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=215}}\n\nIn 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines if necessary, without congressional approval.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 570}}\n\nExamining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard (2014) reports that:\n\n<blockquote>The most striking evolution in the twenty-first century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist....

After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.<ref name=\"american chronicle\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |publisher=American Chronicle |date=March 15, 2006 |title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference\u201493 years young! |first=Robert |last=Rouse |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |archivedate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nRoosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press, which he used to keep in daily contact with his middle-class base. While out of office, he made a living as a writer and magazine editor. He loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. He drew the line, however, at expose-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, set magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but his speech in 1906 coined the term \"[[muckraker]]\" for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. \"The liar\", he said, \"is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves.\"<ref>{{cite book | first1=Arthur | last1 = Weinberg| first2=Lila Shaffer | last2 = Weinberg|title=The Muckrakers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMFrIZ68gwC&pg=PA59 |year=1961|publisher= University of Illinois Press | pages = 58\u201366| isbn = 9780252069864}}</ref>\n\nThe press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. After 1904, he was periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. According to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, near the end of his term, demanded that the Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer's ''New York World''. The publication had accused him of \"deliberate misstatements of fact\" in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court\u2014it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in the state courts. The Justice Department had predicted that result, and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 633\u201334}}\n\n===Election of 1904===\n{{Main |1904 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1904.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|1904 election results]]\n\nThe control and management of the Republican Party lay in the hands of Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley's death. Roosevelt and Hanna frequently cooperated during Roosevelt's first term, but Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to Roosevelt for the 1904 Republican nomination. Roosevelt and Ohio's other Senator, [[Joseph B. Foraker]], forced Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse Roosevelt for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p = 436-437}} Unwilling to break with the president, Hanna was forced to publicly endorse Roosevelt. Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p = 437\u2013438}} In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to [[Cornelius Bliss]], but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his own man, [[George B. Cortelyou]] of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 501\u20133}} The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, [[Robert R.

He also attempted to manage the press's release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club. Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 507}}\n\nThe Democratic Party's nominee in 1904 was [[Alton B.

Democratic newspapers charged that Republicans were extorting large campaign contributions from corporations, putting ultimate responsibility on Roosevelt, himself.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=215\u2013216}} Roosevelt denied corruption while at the same time he ordered Cortelyou to return $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.1|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) of a campaign contribution from Standard Oil.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=216}} Parker said that Roosevelt was accepting corporate donations to keep damaging information from the Bureau of Corporations from going public.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=216}} Roosevelt strongly denied Parker's charge and responded that he would \"go into the Presidency unhampered by any pledge, promise, or understanding of any kind, sort, or description...\".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=216\u2013217}} Allegations from Parker and the Democrats, however, had little impact on the election, as Roosevelt promised to give every American a \"[[Square Deal|square deal]]\".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=216\u2013217}} Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote, and Parker received 38%; Roosevelt also won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 336 to 140.

In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a [[postal savings system]] (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.<ref>Ricard, ed. ''A companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp 160\u201366.</ref>\n\nThe election of 1904 continued to be a source of contention between Republicans and Democrats. A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor [[Charles N. Haskell]] of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his Secretary of Interior [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the [[Osage Nation|Osage lands]] to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York ''Sun'' made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.15|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) after Roosevelt's alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell's allegation as \"a lie, pure and simple\" and obtained a denial from Treasury Secretary [[L. M. Shaw|Shaw]] that Roosevelt had neither coerced Shaw nor overruled him.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=219}}\n\n==Post-presidency==\n===Election of 1908===\n{{Main |1908 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:TR smiling in automobile.tif|thumb|upright=1.35|Roosevelt shortly after leaving office, October 1910]]\n\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. He personally favored Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] as his successor, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 483\u2013485}} Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote the following to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!\" Just weeks later he branded as \"false and malicious\"; the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 626}} At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 488\u2013489}}\n\nIn the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 election]], Taft easily defeated the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1902605|title = William Howard Taft and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 50|issue = 3|pages = 424\u2013442|last1 = Solvick|first1 = Stanley D.|year = 1963|doi = 10.2307/1902605}}</ref>\n\n===Africa and Europe (1909\u20131910)===\n[[File:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt standing next to the elephant he shot on safari]]\n\nIn March 1909, shortly after the end of his presidency, Roosevelt left New York for the [[Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition]], a [[safari]] in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]].<ref name=\"Science1908\">{{cite journal|journal=Science|date= December 18, 1908 | volume = 28 | issue = 729 |pages=876\u201377|jstor=1635075|doi= 10.1126/science.28.729.876| title= President Roosevelt's African Trip | pmid = 17743798|bibcode= 1908Sci....28..876. }}</ref> Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]) and traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]].

He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charley]]. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | pp = 665\u201366}} Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff when he concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in Congress.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 502\u2013503}} Regarding radicalism and liberalism, Roosevelt wrote a British friend in 1911:\n:Fundamentally it is the radical liberal with whom I sympathize. He is at least working toward the end for which I think we should all of us strive; and when he adds sanity in moderation to courage and enthusiasm for high ideals he develops into the kind of statesman whom alone I can wholeheartedly support.\" <ref>letter to [[George Otto Trevelyan]], October 1, 1911, [https://web.archive.org/web/20161206040012/http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.9294915/k.C9B7/Index_R.htm in Albert Bushnell Hart, ed., '' Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia'' (1941) p 499.]</ref>\n\nRoosevelt urged progressives to take control of the Republican Party at the state and local level and to avoid splitting the party in a way that would hand the presidency to the Democrats in 1912. Additionally, Roosevelt expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with the president in the White House in June 1910.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 512\u2013513}}\n\nIn August 1910, Roosevelt gained national attention with a speech at [[Osawatomie, Kansas]], which was the most radical of his career and marked his public break with Taft and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program of \"[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]\", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 675}} Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from [[William Barnes Jr.]], Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss, whom he would later confront in the [[Barnes vs. Roosevelt Libel Trial]]. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 515\u2013516}} Roosevelt nonetheless campaigned for the Republicans in the [[1910 United States elections|1910 elections]], in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since the 1890s. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who argued that he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 517}}\n\nThe Republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 683}} Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 518}} Despite skepticism of La Follette's new league, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for ''The Outlook,'' defending what he called \"the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 684}} With Roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912, La Follette declared his own candidacy in June 1911.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 518}} Roosevelt continually criticized Taft after the 1910 elections, and the break between the two men became final after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; Roosevelt was humiliated by this suit because he had personally approved of an acquisition that the Justice Department was now challenging. However, Roosevelt was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; he instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in 1912.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 519}}\n\n====Dispute over arbitration treaties====\nTaft was a major advocate of arbitration as a major reform of the [[Progressive Era]]. In 1911 Taft and his Secretary of State [[Philander C. Knox]] negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or other tribunal. These were signed in August 1911 but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.<ref>[[David H. Burton]], ''William Howard Taft: Confident Peacemaker'' (2004) pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe arbitration issue opens a window on a bitter philosophical dispute among American progressives. Some, led by Taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice; he had a deep understanding of the legal issues.<ref>John E. Noyes, \"William Howard Taft and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\" ''Villanova Law Review'' 56 (2011): 535+ [https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=vlr online].</ref> Taft's political base was the conservative business community which largely supported peace movements before 1914. However, his mistake in this case was a failure to mobilize that base. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1894200|title = Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 53|issue = 2|pages = 279\u2013298|last1 = Campbell|first1 = John P.|year = 1966|doi = 10.2307/1894200}}</ref>\n\nHowever, an opposing faction of progressives, led by Roosevelt, ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes. Roosevelt worked with his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of the treaties. Lodge thought the treaties impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives.<ref>Robert J. Fischer, \"Henry Cabot Lodge and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\" ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' 78 (Spring 1979): 244-58.</ref> Roosevelt, however, was acting to sabotage Taft's campaign promises.<ref>E.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24443896 online]</ref> At a deeper level, Roosevelt's truly believed that arbitration was a na\u00efve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Rooseveltian approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen's calculation of profit and national interest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Melvin I.

Garfield and Dan Hanna. This endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined to make a statement\u2014requested by Garfield\u2014that he would flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, \"I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.\" In January 1912, Roosevelt declared \"if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 698}} Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms\u2014even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 703}} In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, \"Such extremists are not progressives\u2014they are political emotionalists or neurotics\".{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 709}}\n\nRoosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the Republican Party from defeat in the upcoming presidential election.

These primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt's continuing popularity with the electorate, were not pivotal. The final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee, which was controlled by the party leaders, headed by the incumbent president.\n\nPrior to the [[1912 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Roosevelt expressed doubt about his prospects for victory, noting that Taft had more delegates and control of the credentials committee. His only hope was to convince party leaders that the nomination of Taft would hand the election to the Democrats, but party leaders were determined not to cede their leadership to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 524}} The credentials committee awarded almost all contested delegates to Taft, and Taft won the nomination on the first ballot.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 524\u2013526}} Black delegates from the South played a key role: they voted heavily for Taft and put him over the top.<ref>{{cite book|author=Omar H.

It was later renamed [[Roosevelt River]] in honor of the former President. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his son [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], naturalist Colonel Rondon, George K. Cherrie, sent by the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Brazilian Lieutenant Jo\u00e3o Lira, team physician Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9, 1913, at the height of the rainy season. The trip down the River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.<ref name=\"Millard, 2009\"/>\n\nDuring the trip down the river, Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks. The flesh wound he received, however, soon gave him [[tropical fever]] that resembled the [[malaria]] he had contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before.<ref name=\"oimjjac\">{{Citation | first = Rudolph | last = Marx | title = The Health of The President: Theodore Roosevelt | publisher = Health guidance | date = October 31, 2011}}.</ref> Because the bullet lodged in his chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed, his health worsened from the infection.<ref name=\"DeathNews\"/> This weakened Roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure, he had to be attended to day and night by the expedition's physician and his son Kermit. By then, he could not walk because of the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in the other, which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier. Roosevelt was riddled with chest pains, fighting a fever that soared to {{convert|103|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and at times made him delirious, at one point constantly reciting the first two lines of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem \"[[Kubla Khan]]\": \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree\". Regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others, Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could, preparing to commit suicide with an overdose of [[morphine]].

Upon Roosevelt's return to New York, friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote, perhaps prophetically, to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. For the rest of his few remaining years, he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery.{{Sfn| Thayer | 1919 | pp = 4\u20137}} Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home, critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over {{convert|625|mi|km}} long.

Though he was outraged by the [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]]'s conclusion of a treaty that expressed \"sincere regret\" for the way in which the United States had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many of the reforms passed under Wilson. Roosevelt made several campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the [[1914 United States elections|1914 elections]] were a disaster for the fledgling third party.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 539\u2013540}} Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp = 548\u2013549}} In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the [[1916 Progressive National Convention]] at the same time as the [[1916 Republican National Convention]].

It became reality along Wilson's lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Roosevelt denounced Wilson's approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations. In the end, on March 19, 1920, Wilson had Democratic Senators vote against the League with the [[Lodge Reservations]] and the United States never joined the League of Nations.<ref>David Mervin, \"Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations.\" ''Journal of American Studies'' 4#2 (1971): 201\u2013214.

He insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a \"[[hyphenated American]]\" who juggled multiple loyalties. In March 1917, Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the [[Rough Riders]], and Major [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment.<ref>{{Citation | last = Roosevelt| first = Theodore | title = The Foes of Our Own Household | year = 1917 | page = 347}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1917-0313\">{{cite news |title=Enroll Westerners for Service in War; Movement to Register Men of That Region Begun at the Rocky Mountain Club.

Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs's criticisms, and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"yellow journalism of the woods\".

Morgan]].{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp = 32\u201333}} In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party.<ref>Gary Murphy in \"Theodore Roosevelt, Presidential Power and the Regulation of the Market\" in Serge Ricard, ed. ''A companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp 154\u201372.</ref> Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century [[laissez-faire]] economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 430\u2013431, 436</ref> His [[Square Deal]] domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |title=The Progressive Era (1900\u20131920) |first=Mark |last=Klopfenstein |access-date=January 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626045617/http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Square Deal evolved into his program of \"[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]\", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn | Brands | 1997 | p = 675}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:1914 - Theodore Roosevelt in Center Square.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt in Pennsylvania on October 26, 1914]]\nHistorians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making [[Character (persona)|character]] as important as the issues. His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] for his proposals in 1907\u20131912 that presaged the modern welfare state of the [[New Deal]] Era, including [[Direct tax|direct federal taxation]], [[Labour movement|labor reforms]], and more [[direct democracy]], while [[conservationists]] admire Roosevelt for putting the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] towards future generations on the national agenda, and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[American nationalism|nationalists]] respect his commitment to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], [[Civic engagement|civic duty]] and [[Military history of the United States|military values]], as well as his personality of individual [[Personal responsibility|self-responsibility]] and hardiness.

Ken asks for a divorce and custody. Mike helps Angie get work in a club. She is determined to stay sober so she can regain custody of her daughter. Instead, she ends up in a bar, and wakes the next morning in the apartment of strangers who found her passed out on their stairs.\n\nAngie kidnaps her daughter from the park while the nurse isn't watching. They go to a house in the country where Angie dutifully gives the child dinner and puts her to bed. After she sings her daughter to sleep, she forgets a lit cigarette in the room. Downstairs, she begins to drink and gets lost in memories. The child's shouts finally alert her and Angie rescues her from the flames, but herself suffers serious facial burns.\n\nRealizing that she has hit rock bottom, Angie is positive now she can move forward happily. Ken has talked things over with her doctor and feels that he would like to try to stand by her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Susan Hayward]] as Angie Evans (singing dubbed by [[Peg LaCentra]]) \n* [[Lee Bowman]] as Ken Conway (singing dubbed by Hal Derwin) \n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Steve Anderson\n* [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1917)|Marsha Hunt]] as Martha Gray\n* [[Carl Esmond]] as Dr. Lorenz\n* [[Carleton Young]] as Fred Elliott\n* [[Charles D.

The game is called \"I Doubt It\" by [[Edmond Hoyle]]<ref name=\"hoyle\">Hoyle's Rules of Games, [[Albert Morehead]]</ref> and is commonly known as \"Bullshit\" in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"pagat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html |title=Rules of Card Games: Bullshit / Cheat / I Doubt It |publisher=Pagat.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref>\n\n== Rules of playing Cheat  ==\nOne pack of 52 cards is used for four or less players; five or more players should combine two 52-card packs. Shuffle the cards and deal them as evenly as possible among the players. No cards should be left. Some players may end up with one card more or less than other players.\n\nThe player who sits to the left of the dealer (clockwise) takes the first turn. They choose a card from his/her hand, lays it face down on the table and announces what rank it is (suit is irrelevant), which can be a lie. The 2nd player then adds a card to the pile of one rank higher than the previous card added, also face down, and announces what rank it is, which again can be a lie. Play continues like this until the game is over.\n\nIf any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out on it by announcing \"Cheat\" (or \"Bluff,\" \"I doubt it,\" etc.), and the card in question is revealed to all players. If the player was lying, they have to take the whole pile of cards into their hand. If the player was not lying, the caller must take the pile into their hand. Once the next player has placed a card, however, it is too late to call out any previous players.\n\nThe game ends if any player runs out of cards, at which point they win.\n\n== Variants ==\n\n*A common British variant allows a player to pass their turn if they don\u2019t wish to lie or if all the cards of the required rank have clearly been previously played.\n* Some variants allow a rank above ''or'' below the previous rank to be called.<ref name=\"pagat\"/> Others allow the current rank to be repeated or progress down through ranks instead of up.<ref name=\"pagat\"/>\n* Some variants allow multiple cards of the same rank to be played at once.\n* In some variations a player may also lie about the ''number'' of cards they are playing, if they feel confident that other players will not notice the discrepancy. This is challenged and revealed in the usual manner.<ref name=\"pagat\"/>\n* It also can be played with the colloquially used name \"Bolivian rules,\" where the players must continue placing cards of the same rank until someone calls \"Cheat\" or everyone decides to pass a turn.\n\n== National variants ==\n=== ''Mogeln'' ===\nThe German and Austrian variant is for four or more players and is variously known as '''''Mogeln''''' (\"cheat\"), '''''Schwindeln''''' (\"swindle\"), '''''L\u00fcgen''''' (\"lie\") or '''''Zweifeln''''' (\"doubting\").{{sfn|Geiser|2004|p=48}} A 52-card pack is used (two packs with more players) and each player is dealt the same number of cards, any surplus being dealt face down to the table. The player who has the Ace of Hearts leads by placing it face down on the table (on the surplus cards if any). The player to the left follows and names his discard as the Two of Hearts and so on up to the King. Then the next suit is started. Any player may play a card other than the correct one in the sequence, but if his opponents suspect him of cheating, they call ''gemogelt!'' (\"cheated!\"). The card is checked and if it is the wrong card, the offending player has to pick up the entire stack. If it is the right card, the challenger has to pick up the stack. The winner is the first to shed all their cards; the loser is the last one left holding any cards.{{sfn|G\u00f6\u00f6ck|1967|p=31}}\n\n===''Verish' Ne Verish'''===\nThe Russian game '''''Verish' Ne Verish'''''' (\"Trust, don't trust\") - described by [[David Parlett]] as \"an ingenious cross between Cheat and [[Old Maid]]\"<ref name=\"pecg\">{{cite book |last1=Parlett |first1=David |title=The Penguin encyclopedia of card games |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0140280324 |edition=New |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref> - is also known as Russian Bluff, Chinese Bluff or simply as Cheat.\n\nThe game is played with 36 cards (two or three player) or 52 (four or more). One card is removed at random before the game and set aside face-down, and the remainder are dealt between players (even if this results in players having differently sized hands of cards).<ref name=\"pecg\"/>\n\nThe core of the game is played in the same manner as Cheat, except that the rank does not change as play proceeds around the table: every player must call the same rank.<ref name=\"pecg\"/>\n\nWhenever players pick up cards due to a bluff being called, they may \u2013 if they wish \u2013 reveal four of the same rank from their hand, and discard them.<ref name=\"pagatverish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pagat.com/beating/verish.html |title=Rules of Card Games: Verish' ne verish' |publisher=Pagat.com |date=1996-11-17 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, if the player does not have any of the rank in their hand, they may call \"skip\" or \"pass\" and the next player takes their turn. If every player passes, the cards on the table are removed from the game, and the last player begins the next round.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Canadian/Spanish Bluff===\n\nSimilar to Russian Bluff, it is a version used by at least some in Canada and known in Spain. The rules are rather strict and, while a variation, is not open to much variation. It is also known in English as Fourshit (single deck) and Eightshit (double deck), the game involves a few important changes to the standard rules. Usually two decks are used<ref name=\"pagat\" /> instead of one so that there are 8 of every card as well as four jokers (Jokers are optional), though one deck may be used if desired. Not all ranks are used; the players can arbitrarily choose which ranks to use in the deck and, if using two decks, should use one card for each player plus two or three more. Four players may choose to use 6,8,10,J,Q,K,A or may just as easily choose 2,4,5,6,7,9,J,K, or any other cards. This can be a useful way to make use of decks with missing cards as those ranks can be removed. The four jokers are considered wild and may represent any card in the game.\n\nThe first player can be chosen by any means.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dupyup.com/drinking/view.php?did=14 |title=Dupyup.com |publisher=Dupyup.com |accessdate=2013-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223213738/http://www.dupyup.com/drinking/view.php?did=14 |archivedate=23 February 2012}}</ref> The Spanish variation calls for a bidding war to see who has the most of the highest card. The winner of the challenge is the first player. In Canada, a version is the first player to be dealt a Jack face up, and then the cards are re dealt face down.\n\nThe first player will make a \"claim\" of any rank of cards and an amount of their choice. In this version each player in turn must play as many cards as they wish of the same rank.<ref name=\"pagat\" /> The rank played never goes up, down nor changes in any way. If the first player plays kings, all subsequent players must also play kings for that round (it is non-incremental). Jokers represent the card of the rank being played in each round, and allow a legal claim of up to 11 of one card (seven naturals and four jokers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://khopesh.tripod.com/ent/bs.html |title=Bullshit, the Card Game |publisher=Khopesh.tripod.com |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref> A player may play more cards than they claim to play though hiding cards under the table or up the sleeve is not allowed. After any challenge, the winner begins a new round by making a claim of any amount of any card rank.\n\nIf at any point a player picks up cards and has all eight natural cards of a certain rank, he declares this out loud and removes them from the game. If a player fails to do this and later leads a round with this rank, he or she automatically loses the game.\n\nOnce a player has played all his or her cards, he or she is out of that particular hand. Play continues until there are only two players (at which point some cards have probably been removed from the game). The players continue playing until there is a loser. The object of the game is not so much to win, but not be the loser. The loser is usually penalised by the winners either in having the dishonour of losing, or having to perform a forfeit.\n\n===China===\nIn the [[Fujian]] province, a version of the game known as \u5439\u725b (\"bragging\") or \u8bf4\u8c0e (\"lying\") is played with no restriction on the rank that may be called each turn, and simply requiring that each set is claimed to be of the same number. This makes it possible for a player to play out their entire hand without lying.<ref name=\"pagat\" />\n\nThis version is usually played with several decks shuffled together, allowing players to play (or claim to play) large numbers of cards of the same rank.<ref name=\"pagat\" />\n\n===Sweden===\nKnown as '''''bluffstopp''''' (a portmanteau of ''bluff'' (\"bluff\") and ''stoppspel'' (\"shedding game\".)) Players are given six (or seven) cards at the start of the game, and the remainder makes a pile. Players are restricted to follow suit, and play a higher rank, but are allowed to bluff. If a player is revealed to be bluffing, or a player fails to call or a bluff, the player draws three cards from the pile.\n\nAdditional rules and players to play more than one card in secret, and drop cards in their lap. But if this is discovered, the player must draw three or even six cards.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210030/http://www.talon.cc/Hefte/Talon13-p029.pdf Geiser, Remigius (2004). \"100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg\"], in ''Talon'', Issue 13.\n* G\u00f6\u00f6ck, Roland (1967).

Cheat is classed as a party game.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> As with many card games, cheat has an [[oral tradition]] and so people are taught the game under different names. The game is called \"I Doubt It\" by [[Edmond Hoyle]]<ref name=\"hoyle\">Hoyle's Rules of Games, [[Albert Morehead]]</ref> and is commonly known as \"Cheat\" in Britain and \"Bullshit\" in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"pagat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html |title=Rules of Card Games: Bullshit / Cheat / I Doubt It |publisher=Pagat.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref>\n\n== Rules of playing Cheat  ==\nOne pack of 52 cards is used for four or less players; five or more players should combine two 52-card packs. Shuffle the cards and deal them as evenly as possible among the players. No cards should be left. Some players may end up with one card more or less than other players.\n\nThe player who sits to the left of the dealer (clockwise) takes the first turn. They choose a card from his/her hand, lays it face down on the table and announces what rank it is (suit is irrelevant), which can be a lie. The 2nd player then adds a card to the pile of one rank higher than the previous card added, also face down, and announces what rank it is, which again can be a lie. Play continues like this until the game is over.\n\nIf any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out on it by announcing \"Cheat\" (or \"Bluff,\" \"I doubt it,\" etc.), and the card in question is revealed to all players. If the player was lying, they have to take the whole pile of cards into their hand. If the player was not lying, the caller must take the pile into their hand. Once the next player has placed a card, however, it is too late to call out any previous players.\n\nThe game ends if any player runs out of cards, at which point they win.\n\n== Variants ==\n\n*A common British variant allows a player to pass their turn if they don\u2019t wish to lie or if all the cards of the required rank have clearly been previously played.\n* Some variants allow a rank above ''or'' below the previous rank to be called.<ref name=\"pagat\"/> Others allow the current rank to be repeated or progress down through ranks instead of up.<ref name=\"pagat\"/>\n* Some variants allow multiple cards of the same rank to be played at once.\n* In some variations a player may also lie about the ''number'' of cards they are playing, if they feel confident that other players will not notice the discrepancy. This is challenged and revealed in the usual manner.<ref name=\"pagat\"/>\n* It also can be played with the colloquially used name \"Bolivian rules,\" where the players must continue placing cards of the same rank until someone calls \"Cheat\" or everyone decides to pass a turn.\n\n== National variants ==\n=== ''Mogeln'' ===\nThe German and Austrian variant is for four or more players and is variously known as '''''Mogeln''''' (\"cheat\"), '''''Schwindeln''''' (\"swindle\"), '''''L\u00fcgen''''' (\"lie\") or '''''Zweifeln''''' (\"doubting\").{{sfn|Geiser|2004|p=48}} A 52-card pack is used (two packs with more players) and each player is dealt the same number of cards, any surplus being dealt face down to the table. The player who has the Ace of Hearts leads by placing it face down on the table (on the surplus cards if any). The player to the left follows and names his discard as the Two of Hearts and so on up to the King. Then the next suit is started. Any player may play a card other than the correct one in the sequence, but if his opponents suspect him of cheating, they call ''gemogelt!'' (\"cheated!\"). The card is checked and if it is the wrong card, the offending player has to pick up the entire stack. If it is the right card, the challenger has to pick up the stack. The winner is the first to shed all their cards; the loser is the last one left holding any cards.{{sfn|G\u00f6\u00f6ck|1967|p=31}}\n\n===''Verish' Ne Verish'''===\nThe Russian game '''''Verish' Ne Verish'''''' (\"Trust, don't trust\") - described by [[David Parlett]] as \"an ingenious cross between Cheat and [[Old Maid]]\"<ref name=\"pecg\">{{cite book |last1=Parlett |first1=David |title=The Penguin encyclopedia of card games |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0140280324 |edition=New |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref> - is also known as Russian Bluff, Chinese Bluff or simply as Cheat.\n\nThe game is played with 36 cards (two or three player) or 52 (four or more). One card is removed at random before the game and set aside face-down, and the remainder are dealt between players (even if this results in players having differently sized hands of cards).<ref name=\"pecg\"/>\n\nThe core of the game is played in the same manner as Cheat, except that the rank does not change as play proceeds around the table: every player must call the same rank.<ref name=\"pecg\"/>\n\nWhenever players pick up cards due to a bluff being called, they may \u2013 if they wish \u2013 reveal four of the same rank from their hand, and discard them.<ref name=\"pagatverish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pagat.com/beating/verish.html |title=Rules of Card Games: Verish' ne verish' |publisher=Pagat.com |date=1996-11-17 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, if the player does not have any of the rank in their hand, they may call \"skip\" or \"pass\" and the next player takes their turn. If every player passes, the cards on the table are removed from the game, and the last player begins the next round.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Canadian/Spanish Bluff===\n\nSimilar to Russian Bluff, it is a version used by at least some in Canada and known in Spain. The rules are rather strict and, while a variation, is not open to much variation. It is also known in English as Fourshit (single deck) and Eightshit (double deck), the game involves a few important changes to the standard rules. Usually two decks are used<ref name=\"pagat\" /> instead of one so that there are 8 of every card as well as four jokers (Jokers are optional), though one deck may be used if desired. Not all ranks are used; the players can arbitrarily choose which ranks to use in the deck and, if using two decks, should use one card for each player plus two or three more. Four players may choose to use 6,8,10,J,Q,K,A or may just as easily choose 2,4,5,6,7,9,J,K, or any other cards. This can be a useful way to make use of decks with missing cards as those ranks can be removed. The four jokers are considered wild and may represent any card in the game.\n\nThe first player can be chosen by any means.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dupyup.com/drinking/view.php?did=14 |title=Dupyup.com |publisher=Dupyup.com |accessdate=2013-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223213738/http://www.dupyup.com/drinking/view.php?did=14 |archivedate=23 February 2012}}</ref> The Spanish variation calls for a bidding war to see who has the most of the highest card. The winner of the challenge is the first player. In Canada, a version is the first player to be dealt a Jack face up, and then the cards are re dealt face down.\n\nThe first player will make a \"claim\" of any rank of cards and an amount of their choice. In this version each player in turn must play as many cards as they wish of the same rank.<ref name=\"pagat\" /> The rank played never goes up, down nor changes in any way. If the first player plays kings, all subsequent players must also play kings for that round (it is non-incremental). Jokers represent the card of the rank being played in each round, and allow a legal claim of up to 11 of one card (seven naturals and four jokers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://khopesh.tripod.com/ent/bs.html |title=Bullshit, the Card Game |publisher=Khopesh.tripod.com |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref> A player may play more cards than they claim to play though hiding cards under the table or up the sleeve is not allowed. After any challenge, the winner begins a new round by making a claim of any amount of any card rank.\n\nIf at any point a player picks up cards and has all eight natural cards of a certain rank, he declares this out loud and removes them from the game. If a player fails to do this and later leads a round with this rank, he or she automatically loses the game.\n\nOnce a player has played all his or her cards, he or she is out of that particular hand. Play continues until there are only two players (at which point some cards have probably been removed from the game). The players continue playing until there is a loser. The object of the game is not so much to win, but not be the loser. The loser is usually penalised by the winners either in having the dishonour of losing, or having to perform a forfeit.\n\n===China===\nIn the [[Fujian]] province, a version of the game known as \u5439\u725b (\"bragging\") or \u8bf4\u8c0e (\"lying\") is played with no restriction on the rank that may be called each turn, and simply requiring that each set is claimed to be of the same number. This makes it possible for a player to play out their entire hand without lying.<ref name=\"pagat\" />\n\nThis version is usually played with several decks shuffled together, allowing players to play (or claim to play) large numbers of cards of the same rank.<ref name=\"pagat\" />\n\n===Sweden===\nKnown as '''''bluffstopp''''' (a portmanteau of ''bluff'' (\"bluff\") and ''stoppspel'' (\"shedding game\".)) Players are given six (or seven) cards at the start of the game, and the remainder makes a pile. Players are restricted to follow suit, and play a higher rank, but are allowed to bluff. If a player is revealed to be bluffing, or a player fails to call or a bluff, the player draws three cards from the pile.\n\nAdditional rules and players to play more than one card in secret, and drop cards in their lap. But if this is discovered, the player must draw three or even six cards.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210030/http://www.talon.cc/Hefte/Talon13-p029.pdf Geiser, Remigius (2004). \"100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg\"], in ''Talon'', Issue 13.\n* G\u00f6\u00f6ck, Roland (1967).

Carmel]] after the county seat was moved from a town near the current city of Mount Carmel to Albion.\n\nThe County is named for the [[Wabash River]], which forms its eastern and southern borders. The name \"Wabash\" is an English spelling of the French name for the river, \"Ouabache.\" French traders named the river after the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami Indian]] word for the river, \"Wabashike,\" (pronounced \"Wah-bah-she-keh\"), the word for \"pure white.\" Much of the river bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud.\n<gallery>\nFile:Wabash County Illinois 1824.png|Wabash County at the time of its creation in 1824\n</gallery>\n\nA {{convert|329|acre|km2}} remnant of the county's original Eastern Woodlands [[ecosystem]] can be found in the ''Forest of the Wabash'' located within the county's [[Beall Woods State Park]].\n\nIn the 1920s there existed a famous hotel and resort that existed in Wabash County nearby the Grand Rapids Dam on the Wabash River.  The hotel was named the [[Grand Rapids Hotel]] and was owned by [[Frederick Hinde Zimmerman]].  During the hotel's nine-year existence it catered to individuals from all over the United States.

Carmel]] after the county seat was moved from a town near the current city of Mount Carmel to Albion.\n\nThe County is named for the [[Wabash River]], which forms its eastern and southern borders. The name \"Wabash\" is an English spelling of the French name for the river, \"Ouabache.\" French traders named the river after the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami Indian]] word for the river, \"Wabashike,\" (pronounced \"Wah-bah-she-keh\"), the word for \"pure white.\" Much of the river bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud.\n<gallery>\nFile:Wabash County Illinois 1824.png|Wabash County at the time of its creation in 1824\n</gallery>\n\nA {{convert|329|acre|km2}} remnant of the county's original Eastern Woodlands [[ecosystem]] can be found in the ''Forest of the Wabash'' located within the county's [[Beall Woods State Park]].\n\nIn the 1920s there existed a famous hotel and resort that existed in Wabash County nearby the Grand Rapids Dam on the Wabash River.  The hotel was named the [[Grand Rapids Hotel]] and was owned by [[Frederick Hinde Zimmerman]].  During the hotel's nine-year existence it catered to individuals from all over the United States.
