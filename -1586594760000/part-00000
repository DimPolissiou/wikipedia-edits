He served twice as Deputy Prime Minister of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), in September 1960 and from February to August 1962. Enjoying substantial popularity among the [[Bangala language|Bangala]] people, he headed the Parti de l'Unit\u00e9 Nationale and worked as a key opposition member in [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]] in the early 1960s.\n\nBolikango began his career in the [[Belgian Congo]] as a teacher in Catholic schools, and became a prominent member of Congolese society as the leader of a cultural association. He wrote an award-winning novel and worked as a journalist before turning to politics in the late 1950s. Though he held a top communications post in the colonial administration, he became a leader in the push for independence, making him one of the \"fathers of independence\" in the Congo. The Republic of the Congo became independent in 1960 and Bolikango attempted to organise a national political base that would support his bid for a prestigious office in the new government. He succeeded in establishing the Parti de l'Unit\u00e9 Nationale and promoted both a united Congo and strong ties with Belgium. Older than most of his contemporaries and commanding  significant respect\u2014especially among his Bangala peers, he was seen as the Congo's \"elder statesman\". Regardless, his attempts to secure a position in the government failed and he became a leading member of the opposition in Parliament.\n\nAs the country became embroiled in a [[Congo Crisis|domestic crisis]], the first government was dislodged and succeeded by several different administrations. Bolikango served as Deputy Prime Minister in one of the new governments before a partial state of stability was reestablished in 1961. He mediated between warring factions in the Congo and briefly served once again as Deputy Prime Minister in 1962 before returning to the parliamentary opposition. After [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] took power in 1965, Bolikango became a minister in his government. Mobutu soon dismissed him but appointed him to the political bureau of the [[Mouvement Populaire de la R\u00e9volution]]. Bolikango left the bureau in 1970. He left Parliament in 1975 and died seven years later. His grandson created the Jean Bolikango Foundation in his memory to promote social progress. The President of the Congo posthumously awarded Bolikango a medal in 2005 for his long career in public service.\n\n== Early life ==\nJean Bolikango was born in [[L\u00e9opoldville]], [[Belgian Congo]], on 4 February 1909{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} to a [[Bangala language|Bangala]] family from [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur Province]].{{sfn|LaFontaine|2008|p=218}}{{efn|Bolikango was categorised broadly as a Ngala by the residents of L\u00e9opoldville, though his heritage traced more specifically to the Ngombe people of the [[Lisala]] region.{{sfn|Bennett|1972|p=301}}}} In 1917 he enrolled in St. Joseph's Institute, graduating in December 1925 after six years of [[primary school]], two years of pedagogical studies, and one year of stenography and typing courses.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} He became a licensed primary school teacher the following year.{{sfn|LaFontaine|2008|p=218}} Bolikango taught at [[CICM Missionaries|Scheutist]] schools{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} and finally St. Joseph's Institute until 1958.

Bolikango was eager to win a prominent government office and aimed to form a broad coalition with the [[Ngombe language (Congo)|Ngombe]], [[Mongo people|Mongo]], and [[Ngwaka]] peoples and other minorities in the province to achieve it.

Five days later he announced that he would support the formation of a separate republic in \u00c9quateur Province.{{sfn|CRISP no. 78|1960|loc=paragraph 28}} In return, Lumumba accused him of plotting the secession of the region.{{sfn|Daily Sun|1960|p=2}} On 1 September Bolikango was arrested in [[Gemena]] on Lumumba's orders, ostensibly for committing secessionist activities and planning assassinations of both Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu, and brought to the capital.{{efn|Lumumba told Parliament that Bolikango had been arrested by the \u00c9quateur provincial government.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=294}}}} This led to demonstrations by his supporters throughout the city on the following day.{{sfn|Bacquelaine|Willems|Coenen|2001|p=77}} Soon thereafter, President Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba from office and replaced him with Joseph Il\u00e9o.{{sfn|Young|2015|p=326}} Sympathetic soldiers released Bolikango on 6 September.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|p=165}} During Il\u00e9o's brief first term from 13 September to 20 September Bolikango served as Minister of Information and Minister of Defence.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}} In December he attended a Francophone-African conference in [[Brazzaville]] as part of a Congolese government delegation.{{sfn|De Witte|2002|p=69}}\n\nDuring Il\u00e9o's second term from 9 February until 1 August 1961 Bolikango held the post of Deputy Prime Minister.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}} By then he felt threatened by the sudden collapse of political unity in the Congo and supported the government's efforts at re-centralisation.{{sfn|Willame|1972|pp=37, 39}} He participated in the Tananarive and [[Mbandaka|Coquilhatville]] conferences of March and April 1961, representing \u00c9quateur and [[Ubangi Province|Ubangi]], respectively, to seek a compromise on constitutional issues.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}} Throughout June he worked alongside Cyrille Adoula and [[Marcel Lihau]] to negotiate a settlement between the central government and a rival [[Free Republic of the Congo]] in the eastern portion of the country.{{sfn|Higgins|1980|p=421}} This culminated in a conference in July that resulted in the election of Adoula as Prime Minister. Bolikango was certain that he would also be elected as President but Kasa-Vubu retained the office.{{sfn|O'Brien|1962|p=189}}{{efn|It was widely rumoured in the Congo that Bolikango was offered the position of Third Deputy Prime Minister but turned it down in anticipation of an opportunity to challenge Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=378}}}}\n\nAfter the conference Bolikango helped to mediate negotiations between Adoula and secessionist figure [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], leader of the breakaway [[State of Katanga]].<ref name=monga/> Bolikango claimed that he alone could resolve the situation by sitting \"Bantu fashion with legs out stretched\" around a table with Tshombe.<ref name= atlantic/> He scheduled a political conference to take place in Stanleyville to create a new political party with [[Antoine Gizenga]] with the intent of isolating Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO in Parliament so he could remove the former from the presidency and replace him. The plans dissolved after Gizenga was arrested in January 1962.{{sfn|Africa|1962|p=8}} On 13 February Bolikango was appointed Deputy Prime Minister.{{sfn|Nnoli|2000|p=77}} On 12 July Adoula downsized his government and dismissed him from his post.{{sfn|Yearbook|1963|p=178}} He then re-entered the parliamentary opposition and, by August, was working with [[R\u00e9my Mwamba]] and [[Christophe Gbenye]] (both ex-ministers also dismissed from Adoula's government) to try and secure support to dislodge Adoula. Bolikango was the opposition's favorite to replace the Prime Minister.{{sfn|CIA|1962|pp=14\u201315}} In 1963 following the defeat of Katanga, he managed to organise an opposition coalition to Adoula's government, consisting of ABAKO, leftist followers of Lumumba (by then killed) and Gizenga, and Tshombe's [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]]{{efn|Confederation of Tribal Associations of Katanga}} (CONAKAT).<ref name= atlantic/> He also foiled an attempt by one of Adoula's ministers to establish a pro-government party in \u00c9quateur.<ref>{{cite news| last = Kyle| first = Keith| title = Congo: The First Nation of Africa?| newspaper = [[The Spectator]]| page = 6| date = 9 April 1964| url = http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-april-1964/6/congo-the-first-nation-of-africa| access-date = 29 July 2017}}</ref> That year Parliament was adjourned and Bolikango's term as a national deputy ended.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|p=223}} In late 1963 Laurent Eketebi left PUNA and allied himself with the Budja tribal minority in the provincial assembly, destroying the concept of a unified Bangala tribe that Bolikango had used to elevate his social and political standing.{{sfn|Willame|1972|pp=53, 56}}\n\nIn 1962 Parliament assented to the partitioning of the Congo's six provinces into smaller political units. The subdivision damaged PUNA's political clout, as it had a strong following in Coquilhatville, the \u00c9quateur capital, but not in the outlying areas, where it relied on control of the provincial administration to ensure its presence. Bolikango had opposed the splitting of \u00c9quateur, and in 1965 he made provincial reunification a key part of his parliamentary campaign platform.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|p=207}} In the [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|1965 elections]] he was reelected to a second term in the Chamber of Deputies on a PUNA\u2013[[Convention Nationale Congolaise]]{{efn|Congolese National Convention}} (CONACO) ticket.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}}{{sfn|March\u00e9s tropicaux et m\u00e9diterran\u00e9ens|1966}} He received 53,083 preferential votes, making him the most popular Congolese representative of his respective constituency, second only to Tshombe in southern Katanga.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=53}} Nevertheless, his provincial reunification proposal met strong resistance from the deputies of [[Ubangi Province]]\u2014one of the successor divisions to \u00c9quateur\u2014and was not carried out.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|p=207}}\n\n=== Mobutu regime ===\n[[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] seized power in November 1965, and on 24 November Bolikango was appointed Minister of Public Works.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}}{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|p=220}} Mobutu also intervened in a territorial dispute in the former \u00c9quateur Province and awarded contested land to Ubangi over Moyen-Congo\u2014the new province Bolikango represented. Upset over the outcome, Bolikango convened a meeting of parliamentarians from both provinces in February 1966 to discuss the restoration of \u00c9quateur. His ideas attracted more support than during his previous attempt, as there were provincial assemblymen in Ubangi already petitioning their government for reunification and numerous CONACO politicians had initiated a campaign to eliminate Cuvette-Centrale Province after losing a local struggle for power. With Mobutu's support, \u00c9quateur was restored on 11 April.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\nOn 4 April Mobutu dismissed Bolikango from his ministerial post, ostensibly for \"lack of discipline and refusing to follow received orders.\"{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}}{{sfn|Associated Press|1966}} This firing was the first of many Mobutu would use to pressure established Congolese politicians, though Bolikango was not left disadvantaged for long;{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=56}} on 4 July 1968 he was appointed to the political bureau of the [[Mouvement Populaire de la R\u00e9volution]]{{efn|Popular Movement of the Revolution}} (MPR), the state party, serving there until 16 December 1970.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}} Bolikango's second term as a national deputy ended in 1967.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2015|p=223}} From 1970 until 1975 he served a final term in Parliament, representing the Kinshasa district.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}}\n\nIn his later life Bolikango served as managing director of the Sogenco construction company and general delegate to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 za\u00efroise de Mat\u00e9riaux and STK parastatals.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=66}} During the same time he made frequent trips to Lisala, where he remained a popular figure.

He served twice as Deputy Prime Minister of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), in September 1960 and from February to August 1962. Enjoying substantial popularity among the [[Bangala language|Bangala]] people, he headed the Parti de l'Unit\u00e9 Nationale and worked as a key opposition member in [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]] in the early 1960s.\n\nBolikango began his career in the [[Belgian Congo]] as a teacher in Catholic schools, and became a prominent member of Congolese society as the leader of a cultural association. He wrote an award-winning novel and worked as a journalist before turning to politics in the late 1950s. Though he held a top communications post in the colonial administration, he became a leader in the push for independence, making him one of the \"fathers of independence\" in the Congo. The Republic of the Congo became independent in 1960 and Bolikango attempted to organise a national political base that would support his bid for a prestigious office in the new government. He succeeded in establishing the Parti de l'Unit\u00e9 Nationale and promoted both a united Congo and strong ties with Belgium. Older than most of his contemporaries and commanding  significant respect\u2014especially among his Bangala peers, he was seen as the Congo's \"elder statesman\". Regardless, his attempts to secure a position in the government failed and he became a leading member of the opposition in Parliament.\n\nAs the country became embroiled in a [[Congo Crisis|domestic crisis]], the first government was dislodged and succeeded by several different administrations. Bolikango served as Deputy Prime Minister in one of the new governments before a partial state of stability was reestablished in 1961. He mediated between warring factions in the Congo and briefly served once again as Deputy Prime Minister in 1962 before returning to the parliamentary opposition. After [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] took power in 1965, Bolikango became a minister in his government. Mobutu soon dismissed him but appointed him to the political bureau of the [[Mouvement Populaire de la R\u00e9volution]]. Bolikango left the bureau in 1970. He left Parliament in 1975 and died seven years later. His grandson created the Jean Bolikango Foundation in his memory to promote social progress. The President of the Congo posthumously awarded Bolikango a medal in 2005 for his long career in public service.\n\n== Early life ==\nJean Bolikango was born in [[L\u00e9opoldville]], [[Belgian Congo]], on 4 February 1909{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} to a [[Bangala language|Bangala]] family from [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur Province]].{{sfn|LaFontaine|2008|p=218}}{{efn|Bolikango was categorised broadly as a Ngala by the residents of L\u00e9opoldville, though his heritage traced more specifically to the Ngombe people of the [[Lisala]] region.{{sfn|Bennett|1972|p=301}}}} In 1917 he enrolled in St. Joseph's Institute, graduating in December 1925 after six years of [[primary school]], two years of pedagogical studies, and one year of stenography and typing courses.{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} He became a licensed primary school teacher the following year.{{sfn|LaFontaine|2008|p=218}} Bolikango taught at [[CICM Missionaries|Scheutist]] schools{{sfn|Mulumba|Makombo|1986|p=65}} and finally St. Joseph's Institute until 1958.

Crawshaw was a [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]] whose career lasted from 1894 to 1909 during which time he played a total of 492 games in all competitions, scoring 27 goals. Crawshaw has gone down in the annals of Sheffield Wednesday as one of the key figures in the early history of the club. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries he appeared in The Wednesday side which lifted the [[FA Cup]] on two occasions and won the [[Football League First Division]] title twice. He is the only Sheffield Wednesday player to win two FA Cup winners medals with the club. He appeared for the [[England national football team]] on ten occasions.<ref name=\"all Footballers\">[http://allfootballers.com/ http://allfootballers.com/.] Gives statistics for career.</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nTommy was born on in [[Sheffield]] and was brought up in the Park Hill area of the town along with his brothers [[Percy Crawshaw|Percy]] and George. Both of his brothers played football with Percy appearing nine times for Wednesday while George played for [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]] for many years. Tommy Crawshaw's early football was played with local clubs Park Grange and Attercliffe, in 1893 he moved to play for [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] Central in the newly formed [[Manchester Football League]] and his good form attracted the attention of Sheffield Wednesday. Crawshaw signed for Wednesday on 24 April 1894 as a replacement for the long serving [[Billy Betts]].\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nCrawshaw made his Wednesday debut on 1 September 1894, the opening day of the [[1894\u201395 in English football|1894\u201395]] season, in a 1\u20133 away defeat at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He made an immediate impact in the side missing only two matches that season and was called up for the England side before the season was out. In the following campaign Crawshaw was part of the Wednesday side which won the FA Cup, he played in all six ties, scoring in the 3\u20131 semi-final replay victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. However he did make an uncharacteristic mistake in the final against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] when an error allowed David Black to equalise before Wednesday went on to win 2\u20131 through two [[Fred Spiksley]] goals.\n\nThe 1896 publication ''Famous Footballers'' described Crawshaw as \"A thorough worker always \u2026he plays a good game from first to last and is unselfish to a degree. A good tackler he uses his head cleverly as well.\"<ref name=\"1867\u20131967\">\"''Sheffield Wednesday 1867\u20131967''\", Nick Johnson, {{ISBN|0-7524-2720-2}} Page 24 Gives the quote from Famous Footballers.</ref> In the [[1899\u20131900 in English football|1899\u20131900]] season Crawshaw led Wednesday to promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in their first season at their new home at [[Hillsborough stadium|Owlerton]]. Back in the top flight of English football Crawshaw formed an imposing line of defence with [[Bob Ferrier (Scottish footballer)|Bob Ferrier]] and [[Harry Ruddlesdin]].\n\nCrawshaw made his England international debut on 9 March 1895 in a 9\u20130 win over [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] at the [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|County Ground]], [[Derby]]. Crawshaw's international career spanned nine years in which time he only made 10 appearances, all these were in the [[British Home Championship]]. His England career included a four-year absence from the team between March 1897 and March 1901, although only 10 matches were played in this time. He marked his return to the England team by scoring one of the goals in a 3\u20130 victory over Ireland on 9 March 1901. This one match return was followed by a three-year break out of the team before returning to play two matches in 1904 with his final appearance being against Ireland in Belfast on 12 March 1904.<ref name=\"englandfanzine\">[http://www.englandfanzine.co.uk/teams/players.asp?name=Thomas%20Crawshaw www.englandfanzine.co.uk.] Gives details of England career.</ref>\n\nWhen Wednesday lifted back to back [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championships in [[1902\u201303 in English football|1902\u201303]] and [[1903\u201304 in English football|1903\u201304]] Crawshaw only missed three League matches over the two seasons as captain of the side.

Crawshaw was a [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]] whose career lasted from 1894 to 1909 during which time he played a total of 492 games in all competitions, scoring 27 goals. Crawshaw has gone down in the annals of Sheffield Wednesday as one of the key figures in the early history of the club. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries he appeared in The Wednesday side which lifted the [[FA Cup]] on two occasions and won the [[Football League First Division]] title twice. He is the only Sheffield Wednesday player to win two FA Cup winners medals with the club. He appeared for the [[England national football team]] on ten occasions.<ref name=\"all Footballers\">[http://allfootballers.com/ http://allfootballers.com/.] Gives statistics for career.</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nTommy was born on in [[Sheffield]] and was brought up in the Park Hill area of the town along with his brothers [[Percy Crawshaw|Percy]] and George. Both of his brothers played football with Percy appearing nine times for Wednesday while George played for [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]] for many years. Tommy Crawshaw's early football was played with local clubs Park Grange and Attercliffe, in 1893 he moved to play for [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] Central in the newly formed [[Manchester Football League]] and his good form attracted the attention of Sheffield Wednesday. Crawshaw signed for Wednesday on 24 April 1894 as a replacement for the long serving [[Billy Betts]].\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nCrawshaw made his Wednesday debut on 1 September 1894, the opening day of the [[1894\u201395 in English football|1894\u201395]] season, in a 1\u20133 away defeat at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He made an immediate impact in the side missing only two matches that season and was called up for the England side before the season was out. In the following campaign Crawshaw was part of the Wednesday side which won the FA Cup, he played in all six ties, scoring in the 3\u20131 semi-final replay victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. However he did make an uncharacteristic mistake in the final against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] when an error allowed David Black to equalise before Wednesday went on to win 2\u20131 through two [[Fred Spiksley]] goals.\n\nThe 1896 publication ''Famous Footballers'' described Crawshaw as \"A thorough worker always \u2026he plays a good game from first to last and is unselfish to a degree. A good tackler he uses his head cleverly as well.\"<ref name=\"1867\u20131967\">\"''Sheffield Wednesday 1867\u20131967''\", Nick Johnson, {{ISBN|0-7524-2720-2}} Page 24 Gives the quote from Famous Footballers.</ref> In the [[1899\u20131900 in English football|1899\u20131900]] season Crawshaw led Wednesday to promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in their first season at their new home at [[Hillsborough stadium|Owlerton]]. Back in the top flight of English football Crawshaw formed an imposing line of defence with [[Bob Ferrier (Scottish footballer)|Bob Ferrier]] and [[Harry Ruddlesdin]].\n\nCrawshaw made his England international debut on 9 March 1895 in a 9\u20130 win over [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] at the [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|County Ground]], [[Derby]]. Crawshaw's international career spanned nine years in which time he only made 10 appearances, all these were in the [[British Home Championship]]. His England career included a four-year absence from the team between March 1897 and March 1901, although only 10 matches were played in this time. He marked his return to the England team by scoring one of the goals in a 3\u20130 victory over Ireland on 9 March 1901. This one match return was followed by a three-year break out of the team before returning to play two matches in 1904 with his final appearance being against Ireland in Belfast on 12 March 1904.<ref name=\"englandfanzine\">[http://www.englandfanzine.co.uk/teams/players.asp?name=Thomas%20Crawshaw www.englandfanzine.co.uk.] Gives details of England career.</ref>\n\nWhen Wednesday lifted back to back [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championships in [[1902\u201303 in English football|1902\u201303]] and [[1903\u201304 in English football|1903\u201304]] Crawshaw only missed three League matches over the two seasons as captain of the side.

Thunderstrock is not just a concert, it's an idea to support and encourage the rock bands and music lovers of Ranchi. Simultaneously, the idea is to donate the income generated from the sale of tickets to groups working for the welfare of society. The idea of Thunderstrock emerged back in the year 2008, the idea was to generate funds for Jharkhand Rock Music Association (JRMA) so that JRMA could further plan concerts for rock bands of Ranchi. The initiative was further taken up by band members from Kaalmantra, Genesis and Sonu Chhetry from the band Sparsh, which were the prominent bands of that time.\n\n==First edition in 2008==\nThe first season of Thunderstrock was held in August 2008 at Hotel Ashok in Ranchi. As the initiators for the concept of Thunderstrock, Kaalmantra and Genesis took up the stage that year. These bands were already famous with the rock music lovers of Ranchi, hence the footfall for the concert was immense and the show managed to fetch around Rs. 25,000 which was later donated to JRMA by Mr. K.C. Shashidhar, the Chief General Manager of NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development).\n\n==Second edition in 2009==\nThe second season happened in July 2009. Kaalmantra, Genesis and JRMA being the organizers this time. The event was brought forward with an agenda of spreading awareness among youth on the evils of alcoholism and child labour.\n\n==Third edition in 2010==\nThe third season happened in 2010 with an intention to support Yuwa which is an NGO that empowers girls by combating child marriage, illiteracy and human trafficking in Jharkhand through football and education. This season featured three bands namely Hypnotize, Kaos and none other than Sparsh which was the leading rock band of Ranchi back then. The show was a huge success and again it collected Rs. 25,000 and a donation was made to [[Yuwa-India]] after the show.\n\n==Break in between 2010-2014==\nWith the end of 2010s came the downfall in the audience count for rock and metal music. This really affected the footfall of the audience in the festival especially in a city like Ranchi which is a small city and has not much of people listening to rock and metal music. Also, the initiators of the festival got jobs and moved on leaving the festival for a complete break of four years. The gap was witnessed with the rise of other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) festivals in the city which followed the same momentum in which this festival was started.

For the first time, it was organized in an open-air festival style which experienced a footfall of around 2500. The season featured bands like Death Note, Destiny, Virus, Error 404, Highway 69, Genesis and the leading rock band of [[Darjeeling]] named Head Motif. The donations of that year went to Harmu Football Academy. \n\nHaving organized this festival on such a large scale for the first time, the next season in 2015 could not be conducted as there was a shortage of funds which is the major barrier to organizing this festival as there are no sponsors to the event. This one year gap in 2015 led to the failure of organizing this festival in 2016 and 2017 as well.\n\n==2018 and 2019==\nBut after four years of silence, the thunder struck again and Thunderstrock festival took place on 23rd September 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Thunderstrock Festival 2018|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> in which What Escapes Me from Kolkata was the headliners along with Existence, Genesis and [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]] in the line-up.

Craig had an 18-year playing career as a [[midfielder]], playing over 100 league games for English clubs [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Towards the end of his playing career he became a coach, and he has worked for clubs including [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], Newcastle and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].\n\n== Playing career ==\nCraig was a [[midfielder]] who started his playing career at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. In 1969 [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] paid \u00a3100,000 for his services, a club record transfer fee at the time, as well as a British record for a teenager. Craig scored 37 league goals for Wednesday, including many from the penalty spot. During his time at the club, Wednesday were relegated from the top flight following Craig's first full season, and they continued to struggle in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], finally being relegated again shortly after he left for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1974.

In many markets Fiat stopped sales of the 126 in 1993 in favour of their new front-engined [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]]. At a length of 3.05 metres, total production reach almost 4.7 million units.

By this time 1,352,912 of the cars had been produced in Italy.\n\nThe car was also produced under licence by [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], but assembly only lasted until 1975 with only 2069 having been built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.\n\nThe 126 never achieved the frenzied popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, partly due to the fact that rear-engined small cars were considered outdated by the time it arrived as the Mini had paved the way for [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]] small cars. Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]]. During holidays, it was common to see families of four driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a [[roof rack]]; sightings of PF-126s towing a small [[:pl:Niewiad\u00f3w N126|Niewiad\u00f3w N126]] caravan especially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported.<ref name=zakrz/> PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was on sale with a waiting list. Usually families had to wait a couple of years to buy a car.<ref name=zakrz>Zakrzewski, Adam (2010). pp.72-83</ref> A coupon for a car could also be given by the authorities based on merit.\n\n== Nicknames ==\n\nIn Poland it is called ''Maluch'', which literally means \"small one\" or toddler,<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnock|first=David|title=The East European economy in context: communism and transition|year=1997|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-08626-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qej-6dP5e74C&pg=PA307&dq=126p+Maluch|accessdate=6 November 2010|page=307}}</ref> as well as ''ma\u0142y Fiat'' (\"small Fiat\"), in contrast to [[Fiat 125p]], called ''du\u017cy Fiat'' (\"big Fiat\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Swan|first=Oscar E.|title=Intermediate Polish|year=1986|publisher=Slavica Publishers|isbn=978-0-89357-165-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mD8IAAAAIAAJ&q=ma\u0142y+Fiat&dq=ma\u0142y+Fiat|accessdate=6 November 2010|page=71}}</ref> In some regions, it is also called ''Kaszlak'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Czeszewski|first=Maciej|title=S\u0142ownik polszczyzny potocznej|year=2006|publisher=Wydawn.

The majority of 126s were produced in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], [[Poland]], as the '''[[Polski Fiat]] 126p''', where production continued until 2000. In many markets Fiat stopped sales of the 126 in 1993 in favour of their new front-engined [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]]. At a vehicle length of 3.05 metres, the Fiat 126 is almost exactly the same size as the original British [[Mini]], and although it came to market 14 years later, production ended in the same year (2000), and its total sales of almost 4.7 million units were in close range of the Mini's 5.4 million. In Poland the car became a [[cultural icon]] in a similar manner that the [[Trabant 601]] became for [[East Germany]] during the fall of the Berlin Wall, and earned the nickname ''Maluch'', meaning \"The Little One\" or \"Toddler\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/18/residents-in-polish-city-save-up-and-buy-tom-hanks-a-vintage-car-6456766/|title=Residents in Polish city save up and buy Tom Hanks a vintage car|first=Hannah Lawrence for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=18 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-hanks-poland-fiat-idUSKBN15F2CD|title=Polish fans buy Tom Hanks iconic 'toddler' car|date=31 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 126 used much of the same mechanical underpinnings and layout as its Fiat 500 rear-engined predecessor with which it shared its [[wheelbase]], but featured an all new, slightly larger bodyshell similar to the larger [[Fiat 127]], which was designed by [[Sergio Sartorelli]] and improved safety and interior space.\n[[File:Trunk of a white left hand drive Fiat 126 produced in 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The front footwells, suspension, battery and spare wheel left little room for luggage in the 126 front trunk.]]\nEngine capacity was increased from 594&nbsp;cc to 652&nbsp;cc at the end of 1977 when the cylinder bore was increased from 73.5 to 77&nbsp;mm.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724>{{cite journal| author = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed)| title = Mehr Hubraum und Drehmoment fuer den Fiat 126| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]] | volume = 24 | page = 20 | date = 23 November 1977}}</ref> Claimed power output was unchanged at {{convert|23|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but torque was increased from {{convert|39|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|43|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0}}.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724/>\nThe 594&nbsp;cc engines were still available in early 1983 production.\n\nA subsequent increase took the engine size to 704&nbsp;cc in new \"restyling\" model Fiat 126 Bis (1987\u20131991), with {{Convert|26|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}} of motive power.\n\n[[File:Auto Italia Stanford Hall June 2010 IMG 9616 (4680343746).jpg|thumb|left|Fiat 126 (second from left) at the Auto Italia, Stanford Hall, 2010]]\n\nIn Italy, the car was produced in the plants of [[Cassino]] and [[Termini Imerese]] until 1979. By this time 1,352,912 of the cars had been produced in Italy.\n\nThe car was also produced under licence by [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], but assembly only lasted until 1975 with only 2069 having been built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.\n\nThe 126 never achieved the frenzied popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, partly due to the fact that rear-engined small cars were considered outdated by the time it arrived as the Mini had paved the way for [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]] small cars. Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]].
