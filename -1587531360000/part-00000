[[Dean Waugh]], another of Mark's brothers, is also a cricketer, having played both [[First-class cricket|First-class]] and [[List A cricket]] in Australia for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]].

His three centuries at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] made him the first batsman to ever achieve this feat, with the record later equaled by [[Sourav Ganguly]] at the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. A fourth century in the 1999 tournament made him the only Australian to score four centuries and more than 1000 runs in [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] competition. He also became the leading Australian runscorer and century maker in ODIs during the 1999 tournament as well.\n\nWaugh is regarded as one of the most elegant and gifted stroke makers to ever play the game and his stylish strokeplay was likened to that of [[Stan McCabe]], [[Alan Kippax]],<ref>Piesse, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref> [[Victor Trumper]], [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Greg Chappell]].<ref>Perry, p. 298.</ref>\n\nFollowing his debut Test century, Australian coach [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] compared Waugh's elegance to that of [[Archie Jackson]].<ref name=\"k111\"/> [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]] called Waugh the \"best-looking leg-side player I've seen in my time. . . anything drifting into his pads is hit beautifully.\"<ref>Knight, p. 117.</ref>\n\nHis facile grace also led to accusations that he was a \"lazy\" batsman who was vulnerable to soft dismissals.<ref name=\"az\"/><ref name=\"p126\">Piesse, p. 126.</ref>\n\nWaugh is the younger fraternal twin brother<ref>[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/224522.html]</ref> of Steve Waugh,<ref name=\"az\"/> with whom he played for most of his career and also under his captaincy. They hold the record for the most Test and ODI matches in which siblings appeared together.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n==Early years==\n{{Main|Early life of Mark and Steve Waugh}}\nBorn on 2 June 1965 at [[Canterbury Hospital]] in [[Campsie, New South Wales]], Waugh was the second of twin boys born to Rudiger and Beverley Waugh. He arrived four minutes after Steve. His father was a bank official and his mother was a teacher within the New South Wales Department of Education.<ref name=\"born\">Knight, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The family settled in the [[western Sydney]] suburb of [[Panania, New South Wales|Panania]].<ref>Knight, p. 6.</ref> The twins were later joined by two more brothers, Dean and Danny.<ref>Knight, pp. 9, 13.</ref> From an early age, the parents introduced their children to sport.<ref name=\"k8\"/><ref name=\"p348\">Perry, p. 348.</ref> By the age of six, the twins were playing organised [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[tennis]] and cricket. In their first cricket match, the brothers were both dismissed for [[duck (cricket)|ducks]].<ref name=\"k11\">Knight, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe twins came from a sporting family. Their paternal grandfather Edward was a [[greyhound racing|greyhound]] trainer. Raised in the northern coastal town of [[Bangalow]], Edward earned selection for the New South Wales Country team in [[rugby league]].<ref>Knight, p. 7.</ref> He was about to join Eastern Suburbs in the [[New South Wales Rugby League]], but had to give up his career due to family reasons.<ref name=\"k8\">Knight, p. 8.</ref> Rodger was Edward's only son and was promising tennis player, who was ranked eighth in Australia in his junior years and was the state champion at under-14 level.<ref name=\"k8\"/> On the maternal side, Bev was a tennis player who won the under-14 singles at the South Australian Championships. Her eldest brother Dion Bourne was an opening batsman who played for [[Bankstown District Cricket Club|Bankstown]] in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]] and remains the leading runscorer in the club's history.<ref name=\"k8\"/>\n\nThe twins made their first representative cricket team when they were selected the Bankstown District under-10s at the age of eight.<ref name=\"k12\">Knight, p. 12.</ref> In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools' soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team's three goals in the final.<ref name=\"k14\">Knight, p. 14.</ref> They were a key part of their school's consecutive state cricket championships<ref name=\"k14\"/> and were part of school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year.<ref name=\"k15\">Knight, p. 15.</ref> In their final year, Mark was the captain of the state primary school cricket and tennis teams, both of which won the national championships.<ref name=\"p348\"/><ref name=\"k15\"/> The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat.<ref name=\"p348\"/>\n\nBy this time, the increasing time demands led to conflicts between the sports and were in one case delisted from a team due to a conflict of commitments.<ref name=\"k15\"/> The twins progressed to [[East Hills Boys Technology High School]], which had a history of producing Australian international representatives in a number of sports.<ref name=\"k17\">Knight, p. 17.</ref> Aged 13, the twins were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown's first grade team, to trial for the club's under-16 team for the Green Shield and both were selected. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 1979\u201380, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season<ref name=\"k18\">Knight, p. 18.</ref> and achieved the same level in soccer.<ref name=\"k19\">Knight, p. 19.</ref> In 1980\u201381 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season. Mark's performance in the Green Shield saw him selected in Bankstown's under-21 team, still aged 15.<ref>Knight, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> The brothers often won formed a two-man team\u2014in one match, Mark scored a century and then the brothers took 16/85 between them.<ref name=\"k21\">Knight, p. 21.</ref> At the end of 1980, the twins were selected in the state under-16 team for the national carnival, with Mark as vice-captain.<ref name=\"k22\">Knight, p. 22.</ref>\n\nWhen Mark was 16, he grew around one foot in one year. It was a relief, because he had been diagnosed with the repetitive stress injury [[Osgood-Schlatter disease]] at 15 and told that he would not grow any further than his then height of 152&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"k20\">Knight, p. 20.</ref> The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for [[Sydney United|Sydney Croatia]] in the state league and the pair were paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.<ref name=\"k23\">Knight, p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe brothers were promoted to Bankstown's Second XI,<ref name=\"k23\"/> before being selected for the First XI in the 1982\u201383 season, aged 17, both making their debut against Western Suburbs, with Mark making 97 on debut,<ref name=\"k24\">Knight, p. 24.</ref> ending the season with 427 runs at 30.50. This placed him second in his team's aggregates and he contributed 14 wickets at 10.71.<ref name=\"k25\">Knight, p. 25.</ref> By this time, his coaches had already identified the traits by which Mark was to be characterised in his international career, those of apparent laziness and reliable catching.<ref name=\"k26\"/>\n\nThe twins finished high school at the end of 1983.<ref name=\"k27\">Knight, p. 27.</ref> In 1983\u201384, both were members of New South Wales Combined High Schools and the state under-19 team.<ref name=\"k26\">Knight, p. 26.</ref> Mark was named as the player of the series after scoring two centuries.<ref name=\"k27\"/><ref name=\"p349\"/> The brothers were then selected for Australia for the first time. They had been named in the national under-19 team to play a Test and ODI series against the touring Sri Lankan counterparts.<ref name=\"k27\"/> The under-19 series pitted several future international players against one another.<ref name=\"k29\">Knight, p. 29.</ref> Mark scored 123 in the second Test at the [[Adelaide Oval]].<ref name=\"k29\"/>\n\nWaugh did not contemplate going to university; both he and his brother became sports equipment salesmen.<ref name=\"p349\">Perry, p. 349.</ref><ref name=\"k834\">Knight, pp. 31\u201332.</ref> He made his maiden First XI century during the season, scoring 108 against Mosman.<ref name=\"k834\"/>\n\nAt the start of the 1984\u201385 season, the brothers were included in the New South Wales state squad.<ref name=\"k33\">Knight, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Formative professional career==\n\nAt the end of the season, the Waugh twins signed a contract to spend the Australian winter to play for [[Egerton Cricket Club|Egerton]] in the [[Bolton League]] in [[Lancashire]] in [[northern England]]. Each club was allowed to have one professional; Steve was officially designated as such but would split the earnings with Mark. The twins were billeted with a local family.<ref name=\"k36\">Knight, p. 36.</ref> However, during the year, an Australian rebel tour to [[South Africa]] was staged, breaking the boycott against the [[apartheid]] regime. Some players defected from the Australian Test team to play in South Africa. This resulted in [[Dave Gilbert (cricketer)|Dave Gilbert]] being promoted to the national squad, forcing him to forfeit his Esso scholarship, which allowed him to play Second XI cricket in the [[County Championship]].<ref name=\"k37\">Knight, p. 37.</ref> Steve was selected to replace Gilbert with [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], leaving Mark as the lone professional.<ref name=\"k38\">Knight, p. 38.</ref> Waugh struggled at first, but recovered to score six centuries for the season. As a reward for scoring more than 800 runs and taking more than 50 wickets, Waugh's captain, who was a dentist, gave him free service. Waugh eventually finished the season with 1460 runs and 75 wickets, breaking the club runscoring record by more than 200 runs.<ref name=\"k39\">Knight, p. 39.</ref>\n\nWaugh returned to Australia for the 1985\u201386 season, looking to make his First-class debut. He scored 177 against [[Petersham Cricket Club|Petersham]] in just five hours and was selected for the state Second XI. Then, an opportunity arose with further ramifications of the rebel tours of South Africa. A two-year ban on playing state cricket was imposed on the players. This meant that New South Wales was looking for two new opening batsmen, as both [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1961)|Steve Smith]] and [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]] had defected and been banned. Waugh and Taylor were selected to make their [[Sheffield Shield]] debut.<ref name=\"k40\">Knight, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n===First-class cricket===\nWaugh and Mark Taylor opened on debut against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] at [[Hobart]]'s [[TCA Ground]]. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was dismissed for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 in the first innings.<ref name=\"k42\">Knight, p. 42.</ref> He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair overslept on Taylor's 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding driils, forcing the pair to take hundreds of catches.<ref name=\"k43\">Knight, p. 43.</ref> He took his first catch, that of [[Roger Woolley]] on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler [[Merv Hughes]] in the next match against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] and then 17 and a [[run out]] for another duck against the touring [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref>Knight, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> With a First-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped for the next five matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line [[pace bowling|fast bowler]] and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in his first match in the role. They were his first First-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with [[Mike Whitney]],<ref name=\"k45\">Knight, p. 45.</ref> due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings.<ref name=\"k46\">Knight, p. 46.</ref> Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again in the Sheffield Shield final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales' only pacemen and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with [[Greg Dyer]] to help avoid the [[follow on]] with 41.<ref name=\"k47\">Knight, p. 47.</ref> Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season.<ref>Knight, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> He played in one limited overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.<ref name=\"k49\">Knight, p. 49.</ref>\n\nAt this stage of his career, Waugh lived in the shadow of his brother Steve, who was promoted to the Australian team at the age of 20. As a result, Mark was sometimes called ''Afghan'', a reference to the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], sometimes dubbed the \"forgotten war\".<ref name=\"az\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=The last of cricket's cavaliers|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/136774.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=16 February 2004}}</ref> Building up an impressive record at First-class level, Waugh spent two seasons with English county Essex as the team's successor to [[Allan Border]] as an overseas professional.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, he was voted the Sheffield Shield Player of the Year.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nIn mid-1988, Waugh was signed to replace Australian captain Allan Border for a six-week stint as the overseas professional at Essex County Cricket Club in England, after just one full season of Sheffield Shield. Border had to leave before the end of the season because of the Australian tour of [[Pakistan]] and had recommended Waugh, who arrived with high expectations.<ref name=\"kc\">Knight, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Essex were one of the strongest teams in England and Border had scored six centuries that season.<ref name=\"kc\"/> Waugh's debut came in August in a limited overs match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Castle Park Cricket Ground|Colchester]]. After struggling at the start of his innings,<ref name=\"kc\"/> Waugh found his rhythm and reached 103 from only 94 balls, accumulating his second 50 in just 28 balls.<ref name=\"k66\">Knight, p. 66.</ref> He ended with 15 fours and a six and then took 2/16 with the ball. Waugh played in three First-class matches, scoring 178 runs at 44.50.<ref name=\"k66\"/> His performances were enough to prompt Essex officials to invite him to return for the 1989 season. Waugh accepted, subject to him not being selected for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1989|1989 Ashes tour of England]] with the national side.<ref name=\"k67\">Knight, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn the longer form, Waugh continued to be overlooked and was criticised for his apparently casual attitude.<ref name=\"k77\">Knight, p. 77.</ref> Simpson, now the Australia coach, criticised Waugh, believing that he was not fully exploiting his talent.<ref name=\"k79\">Knight, p. 79.</ref> He scored only one half-century in the remainder of the First-class season, ending the season with 727 First-class runs at 40.39.<ref name=\"k368\">Knight, p. 368.</ref> He did not take a wicket for the season.<ref name=\"k79\">Knight, p. 79.</ref> He was overlooked for the 1989 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour.<ref name=\"k80\">Knight, p. 80.</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Waugh returned to Essex for his first full season as the overseas professional. He began slowly with a 77 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] being his only score beyond 50 in his first six innings. He then scored 92 and took 3/23 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] and then three fifties in the next six innings, including 89 not out against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. Waugh then broke through for his first First-class county century, scoring 109 at [[Valentines Park|Ilford]] in late June against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], whose pace attack was led by [[Malcolm Marshall]].<ref name=\"k82\">Knight, p. 82.</ref> He then scored 112 not out against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in a one-dayer,<ref name=\"k83\">Knight, p. 83.</ref> but had another lean run in the County Championship, failing to pass 30 in nine consecutive innings.<ref name=\"k84\">Knight, p. 84.</ref> Waugh returned to form with 110 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], before scoring an unbeaten century against Australia in a tour match. He scored 100 from 165 deliveries, while Steve rached his century in 101 balls for Australia.<ref name=\"k85\">Knight, p. 85.</ref> Waugh finished his season with 165 against Leicester. He had scored 1537 runs at 43.91.<ref name=\"k85\"/> He took 31 catches in 24 matches<ref name=\"k362\">Knight, p. 362.</ref> and took 14 wickets at 29.62.<ref name=\"k371\">Knight, p. 371.</ref> Essex finished second in the County Championship, six points behind [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].<ref name=\"k85\"/> They would have won were it not for the 25-point penalty that was incurred for pitch-doctoring.<ref name=\"k84\"/> Essex paid Waugh and his teammates championship-winning bonuses, indicating their belief that they were the rightful champions.<ref name=\"k85\"/> Essex reached the final of the Benson & Hedges Cup against Nottinghamshire. Waugh made 41 from 58 balls before his team lost after conceding the winning runs from the last ball of the match.<ref>Knight, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn the first Sheffield Shield match of the season, Waugh scored 172 from 301 balls, his highest First-class score to date.<ref name=\"k91\">Knight, p. 91.</ref> He hit 20 boundaries. He then struck 42 and took three wickets against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but was overlooked for the Test against New Zealand. He scored 46 and 18 and took 1/31 and 2/34 against Queensland, before striking and unbeaten 100 against Victoria. Despite this Waugh was not selected for the opening phase of the season's ODI tournament.<ref name=\"k92\">Knight, p. 92.</ref> At the start of 1990, he went three innings without passing 30, before striking another unbeaten century against Victoria. New South Wales was then sent in at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Waugh struck 137 from 185 runs on the first day, including a six from [[Peter Sleep]] that narrowly missed the clock tower.<ref name=\"k93\">Knight, p. 93.</ref> The [[Sydney Morning Herald]] opined that \"Waugh would imperiously render them [the fielders] obsolete, going over, between and sometimes through them\".<ref name=\"k94\"/>\n\nWaugh returned to state duty and New South Wales needed to beat Tasmania in their last match to qualify for the final.

He was dropped from the ODI team in the early part of the season, then omitted from the Test team in favour of [[Tom Moody]] for the fifth Test against [[India national cricket team|India]] in Perth. Following his recall to the ODI team in place of the injured Bruce Reid, Waugh scored only 20 runs at 6.67.\n\nHe was part of the team that failed to make the semi-finals of the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], but did not play the entire tournament due to his poor form. After scoring two in the opening match against New Zealand at [[Eden Park]], he was dropped for three games, then played in the last four matches. His best effort was an unbeaten 66 from 39 balls against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at [[Bellerive Oval]]. On the tour of Sri Lanka that followed, Waugh returned to the Test team and scored five and 56 in the first Test but followed it with four consecutive ducks.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nA score of 112 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in the second Test of 1992\u201393 helped set up an Australian victory and a 1\u20130 lead in the Frank Worrell Trophy series against the West Indies. During that season's [[World Series Cup]], he scored a half-century and took 5/24 as Australia successfully defended a small total.\n\n===ODI opener===\nAfter two unproductive Tests on the 1993 New Zealand tour, Waugh was dropped for the third Test, this time in favour of the younger Damien Martyn. In the ODI series, Australia opted for a new strategy and promoted Waugh to open the batting. He scored 60 and 57 in the first two matches to help set up an Australian victory, then scored his maiden ODI century, 108 in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. A score of 83 in the final match made him the leading batsman of the series with 308 runs at 61.60. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the second Test at [[Lord's]]\u2014the spiritual home of cricket\u2014 Waugh started on six one the second morning scored quickly to reach 99. He was looking for his century during an over by [[Phil Tufnell]]. Tufnell was employing his customary defensive approach of pitching the ball outside the leg stump with a leg side field. The first ball was a half-volley and Waugh hit it straight from the middle of the bat. However, the ball hit the short leg fielder in the shins. Later in the over, another leg side ball hit his pads, rolled between his legs and onto the stumps, meaning that Waugh missed out on his century.<ref>Knight, p. 164.</ref>\n\nTufnell dismissed him more than ten times in Test matches utilising this tactic. A century against New Zealand in Hobart brought Waugh's total to 987 Test runs for the calendar year.\n\n===Bribery claims===\nStarting 1994 well, Waugh was named Player of the Finals against South Africa in the World Series Cup and he then scored a century against the same opponents in the drawn third Test in [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead|Durban]]. Later in the year, Waugh claimed that Pakistan captain [[Saleem Malik]] had offered him (along with [[Tim May]] and [[Shane Warne]]) money to perform poorly during a match on the tour of Pakistan. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Waugh's performances were beyond reproach: he scored three half-centuries in the Tests and an ODI century during the match in question.\n\nIn the first Test of 1994\u201395, Waugh hit his highest score yet,<ref name=\"testlist\">{{cite web| title= Statsguru \u2013 ME Waugh \u2013 Tests \u2013 Innings by innings list | url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1985;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1985-12-26;start=1985-12-26;enddefault=2004-01-06;end=2004-01-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> 140 against England in [[Brisbane]].<ref>Piesse, p. 224.</ref> In the second innings, Australia was seeking quick runs to set up a declaration.

Australia went on to win the Test and Waugh contributed 71 and 29 in another win in [[Melbourne]].\n\nWaugh failed to pass 25 in the rain-affected draw in the third Test in Sydney, before claiming career-best bowling figures of 5/40 in a losing team during the second innings of the fourth Test in [[Adelaide]].<ref>Piesse, p. 234.</ref><ref>Knight, p. 201</ref> In the fifth Test at the WACA, Waugh scored 88 in the first innings before returning as a [[runner (cricket)|runner]] for the injured [[Craig McDermott]].

This came during a 116-run partnership with his brother, noted for a particularly menacing spell by [[Allan Donald]] with the second new ball, repeatedly hitting the twins.<ref name=\"Piesse, p. 229\">Piesse, p. 229.</ref><ref>Knight, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref> He batted out the entire fifth day for an unbeaten 115 in the third Test at the Adelaide Oval to deny the South Africans a victory and win the series for Australia.<ref name=\"Piesse, p. 229\"/> Having scored 63 in the first innings, Waugh came the crease late on the fourth day with Australia at 2/17 and attempting to survive for a draw. He was dropped early and was 11 at stumps. Waugh continued to resist on the following day and brought up his century. Struck by a bouncer from [[Shaun Pollock]] late on the final day, Waugh broke the stumps with his bat while walking away, so South Africa appealed for hit wicket, which was denied.<ref>Knight, pp. 265\u2013266.</ref> South African skipper [[Hansie Cronje]] later speared a [[stump (cricket)|stump]] through the umpires' dressing room in anger at the decision.<ref>Piesse, pp. 143\u2013144.</ref> It was only the second time in his career that he had scored consecutive centuries. Waugh took satisfaction in the fact that his century was responsible for saving the Test.<ref name=\"k267\"/> He finished the series with 279 runs at 69.75.<ref name=\"testlist\"/>\n\nThe 1997\u201398 Australian season marked a change in Waugh's ODI career. The Australian selectors changed their policy and picked Test and ODI teams separately, with specialists chosen accordingly in either form of the game. Waugh's captain and opening partner Taylor was dropped.<ref name=\"Knight, p. 263\"/> Australia had trouble finding a suitable partner for Waugh, with [[Michael di Venuto]], Tom Moody and [[Stuart Law]] all trialled as his opening partner. Despite the instability, Waugh compiled 104 to help Australia successfully chase a target against New Zealand in a round-robin match at the Adelaide Oval.<ref>Knight, p. 264.</ref> He finished the series as Australia's leading runscorer with 320 runs at 35.55,<ref name=\"k265\"/> and took seven wickets at 25.43.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> During the finals series, new wicketkeeper [[Adam Gilchrist]] was elevated to the opening position. The new combination got off to a poor start, with Waugh run out for three in a mix-up in the first final,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}<ref name=\"k265\">Knight, p. 265.</ref> but the pair went on to become Australia's long term opening pair.<ref name=\"k267\">Knight, p. 267.</ref> After losing all four group matches to South Africa,<ref name=\"p356\">Perry, p. 356.</ref> Australia won the finals series 2\u20131.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> The partnership with Gilchrist marked a shift in Waugh's role in ODIs. Waugh had previously been more aggressive while Taylor was his partner, but with the naturally aggressive Gilchrist as his partner, Waugh tended to anchor the innings.<ref name=\"k267\"/>\n\nWaugh's strong start to the year continued in two brief ODI series in New Zealand and India, in which he scored 374 runs at 41.56 respectively, with three half-centuries.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> Australia lost the first two Tests in India, with Waugh scoring 66 in the first innings in the first Test in [[Chennai]] but otherwise failing to pass 20.<ref>Knight, pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> In the third Test in [[Bangalore]], Waugh scored his highest Test score of 153 not out while suffering nausea, vomiting and fever.

He regarded it as the most difficult day of his career.<ref>Knight, pp. 279\u2013280.</ref> In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 51 and was given a standing ovation by some parts of the crowd in contrast to other hostile sections. He took three catches in England's second innings as Australia won the match to retain the Ashes.<ref name=\"k282\">Knight, p. 282.</ref> Waugh scored 36 and 43 in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which saw him pass 1,000 Test runs for the calendar year.<ref name=\"k282\"/>\n\nWaugh started 1999 as he did the previous year, with a century in the New Year's Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After being dropped before he had scored, Waugh scored 121 in five hours on the first day, sharing a partnership of 190 with his brother. He became the fifth Australian to take 100 Test catches when he caught [[Nasser Hussain]] in the first innings from the bowling of [[Colin Miller (cricketer)|Colin Miller]]. Australia won the Test and Waugh ended the series with 393 runs at 56.14, placing him second in the batting averages.<ref>Knight, p. 283.</ref> In the ODI series, he scored six consecutive half-centuries in a consistent run that augured well for the upcoming World Cup.<ref name=\"odilist\">{{cite web| title= Statsguru \u2013 ME Waugh \u2013 ODIs \u2013 Innings by innings list | url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1985;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1985-12-26;start=1985-12-26;enddefault=2004-01-06;end=2004-01-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> His tally of 542 runs at 49.27 was the highest for the tournament.

He then made 217 runs at 31.00 in the ODIs, Australia's second highest runscorer, before the team headed to England for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]].<ref>Knight, pp. 290\u2013291.</ref>\n\nWaugh started the tournament with a Man of the Match 67 against [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] in [[Worcester]] as Australia unconvincingly won by four wickets in its first match. He then scored two and 41 as Australia lost to New Zealand and Pakistan respectively, leaving them needing to avoid defeat in all of their remaining matches to win the World Cup.<ref>Knight, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> Waugh scored only 33 and three as Australia defeated [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] and the West Indies to progress to the Super Six phase. Needing to win all their matches, Waugh top-scored with 83 against India at The Oval in a win. He then scored 104 from 120 balls against Zimbabwe at Lord's in another victory. In the process, he passed Allan Border's Australian record of 6,524 ODI career runs and became the first person to score four centuries in World Cup competition. He dedicated this achievement to his dying grandfather. He was then run out for five in the final Super Six match against South Africa.<ref>Knight, p. 293.</ref> In the semi-final against same team, he was dismissed without scoring. Waugh participated in the final play of the match. With the scores tied in the last over of South Africa's run chase and with one wicket remaining, he fielded the ball as [[Lance Klusener]] and Allan Donald attempted the winning run. The South Africans had a mix-up and a run out resulted in a tie. The Australians progressed to the final as they had won their previous meeting.<ref>Knight, pp. 294\u2013295.</ref>\n\nIn the final against Pakistan at Lord's, he set the tone of the match with a sideways diving catch to dismiss [[Wajahatullah Wasti]]. Pakistan were bowled out for 132. Waugh was 37 not out when [[Darren Lehmann]] struck the winning runs. He finished the tournament with 375 runs at 41.67, making him Australia's second highest runscorer for the tournament.<ref>Knight, p. 297.</ref>\n\nIn late 1999, Australia toured Sri Lanka.

Note the spike near the end of his career due to the 2000\u201301 series.]]\nAfter the being close to omission the previous season, Waugh made a good start to the 2000\u201301 season, scoring 119 against the West Indies in the second Test in Perth. He added two further half-centuries to total 339 runs at 48.4 as the Windies were defeated 5\u20130. His productive summer continued in the limited overs format when he went on to score an Australian ODI record of 173 in the second tri-series final against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was one of three ODI centuries he scored in that tournament, the others being a 112 and 102, both not out, against the West Indies and Zimbabwe respectively. In total he scored 540 runs in the series at an average of 108.00. As the leading runscorer by far in the tournament, he was expected to be named Player of the Series, resulting in widespread crowd jeering when it was instead awarded to [[Brian Lara]]. Waugh was also tipped to win the [[Allan Border Medal]] due to his prolific runscoring that year. However, despite leading the player votes with 32, the umpire and media thought otherwise, awarding Steve Waugh 37 votes to his 32, making Steve the winner 65\u201364.\n\nThe 2001 tour of India saw Australia's 16 Test winning streak come to an end when India claimed the series 2\u20131. Waugh scored 70 and 57 in the third Test in Chennai to finish with 149 runs at 29.80 in a difficult series. Waugh continued his fine ODI form with another century, an unbeaten 133 against India in the second ODI, but was forced to return home after his finger was fractured by a [[Javagal Srinath]] delivery.\n\n===Catching world record===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\nDuring the 2001 Ashes series, Waugh topped the aggregates with 430 runs, scoring Test centuries at Lord's (108) and The Oval (120). He broke Mark Taylor's world record of 157 Test catches. Waugh was unable to maintain this form in the 2001\u201302 Australian summer: he totalled 269 (at 33.6) in six Tests against New Zealand and South Africa, without a century. Media scrutiny of his inability to combat short-pitched bowling increased and led to speculation about his long-term future in the team.\n\nNevertheless, he passed two major milestones: the Test at Adelaide marked the 100th Test in which both Waughs played, while the following game was his 100th consecutive Test match. Waugh and fellow ODI opener Adam Gilchrist both hit a batting slump during the VB series, with Waugh averaging 26 for the series and Gilchrist less. Frequent poor starts to the innings resulted in Australia's failure to qualify for the final of the tri-series for the first time in five years. Later in the year, the selectors reacted by dropping Steve and Mark Waugh, the oldest members of the team, in favour of younger players.\n\n===Final series===\nMaintaining his place in the Test team, Waugh toured South Africa in early 2002. Although he passed 15 in each of his innings, he managed only one half-century in his 169 runs at 33.8. In an attempt to regain form, he had a brief stint with Essex in the English County Championship. In the subsequent three-Test series against Pakistan, played on neutral grounds in Sri Lanka and the [[United Arab Emirates]] due to security reasons, he made only 80 runs at 20. Waugh retired from international cricket in late 2002 after being omitted for the upcoming Test series against England in favour of Darren Lehmann.\n\nWaugh retired as Australia's highest run scorer and century maker (18) in ODI cricket, with these records having since been broken by [[Ricky Ponting]]. His world record of 181 Test catches was broken by India's Rahul Dravid in 2009.\n\n[[Image:Mark Waugh Graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Mark Waugh's Test career batting performance graph.]]\n\n==Fielding==\nWaugh took a record 181 catches in Test matches, the second highest for a non wicketkeeper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} He primarily fielded in the second slip position whilst a fast bowler was operating. He would field at silly point whilst a spin bowler was operating and then at first slip for a spinner following the retirement of Mark Taylor. Additionally, he would field at mid-wicket or short mid-wicket when he was not required in a close catching position and also during ODIs.\n\n==Involvement with bookmakers==\nIn 1993, Waugh was a member of the Australian team competing in the [[Hong Kong Sixes]]; one of the Indian team was Test all-rounder [[Manoj Prabhakar]].<ref>Knight, p. 171.</ref> A report by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] in 2000 implicated Prabhakar for acting as a conduit for bookmakers involved in illegal cricket betting, which resulted in Prabhakar receiving a five-year suspension from the game. The report also documented allegations by Indian bookmaker Mukesh Gupta that Prabhakar had introduced him to Waugh during the tournament and that Waugh was paid A$20,000 for insider information about the Australian team, pitch conditions and weather information.\n\nWhen the allegations were made public by the report in November 2000, Waugh immediately pledged to co-operate with any inquiry. In January 2001, the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit and the ACB's special investigator Greg Melick requested an interview with Waugh, which his management \"presently declined\". Waugh received legal advice to seek further clarification of the scope of the investigation. After condemnation from the ACB and media, and the possibility of losing his contract with the ACB, Waugh agreed to the interview.<ref>Knight, pp. 309\u2013306.</ref> He was cleared in August 2001.<ref>Knight, p. 327.</ref>\n\nDuring the Singer World Series tournament, played in Sri Lanka during September 1994,  Waugh made a decision which came back to affect his career four years later. He was approached in [[Colombo]] by an Indian named \"[[John (bookmaker)|John]]\", a bookmaker who asked him for general pitch and weather information as well as insider team information. In return, Waugh received US$4,000. The arrangement continued during the 1994\u201395 Australian summer, but he refused to divulge inside team information. Waugh introduced \"John\" to Shane Warne.<ref>Knight, pp. 184\u2013186.</ref>\n\nOn the 1994 tour of Pakistan, Waugh claimed that along with Warne and Tim May, he was offered A$200,000 to underperform by Pakistan captain Saleem Malik. The offer was in regard to an ODI played in Rawalpindi on 22 October. Waugh says he rejected the bribe and went on to score 121* from 134 deliveries in the match.<ref>Knight, pp. 188\u2013190.</ref> The trio signed a statement in early 1995 stating their claims, which were forwarded to the ICC.<ref>Knight, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> In October 1995, a Pakistan Cricket Board inquiry led by former Pakistan Supreme Court judge [[Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim]] ruled that the allegations, \"are not worthy of any credence and must be rejected as unfounded\". Further, he stated that they \"appear to have been concocted\".<ref name=\"Knight, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nHowever, during the 1998 tour of Pakistan, the issue was again raised, as the [[Government of Pakistan]] had initiated a separate judicial inquiry into general issues regarding the performance of the Pakistani team and allegations of illegal betting by past and former players. Waugh, along with his captain Mark Taylor and ACB CEO [[Malcolm Speed]], were summoned to [[Lahore]] by PCB CEO [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]] to appear before an inquiry led by Justice [[Malik Mohammed Qayyum]].<ref>Knight, pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, prior to the Adelaide Test match against England, news broke that Waugh and Warne were involved with \"John\" four years earlier and had been fined by the ACB. Both players were required to make public statements acknowledging that they had been, \"naive and stupid\" and reasserting that they were not involved in corruption. The players were widely condemned by the media and public, with Prime Minister of Australia [[John Howard]] stating that he felt an \"intense feeling of disappointment\". Former Test player [[Neil Harvey]] called for both players to be banned.<ref>Knight, pp. 275\u2013279.</ref> In May 2000, the PCB banned Malik for life, after a recommendation from the Qayyum investigation, which concluded that Malik had attempted to bribe Waugh, Warne and May.<ref name=\"Knight, p. 308\"/>\n\n==After cricket==\nIn 2002, he did a brief stint as [[Nine Network]] cricket commentator during the 3-match Australia-Pakistan ODI series.\n\nWaugh was previously a commentator on [[Network Ten]] for the [[Big Bash]] as well as a national selector. In 2018, Ten lost the rights to the Big Bash.\n\nHe was named as an opening [[batsman]] in [[Australia cricket team|Australia]]'s \"greatest ever [[One Day International|ODI]] team.\"<ref>{{cite

{{postnominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 2 June 1965) is an Australian cricket commentator and former international [[cricket]]er, who represented [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in Test matches from early 1991 to late 2002, after previously making his [[One Day International]] (ODI) debut in 1988.\n\nWaugh is often nicknamed ''Junior'' as he is younger than his twin brother [[Steve Waugh|Steve]] by a few minutes. [[Dean Waugh]], another of Mark's brothers, is also a cricketer, having played both [[First-class cricket|First-class]] and [[List A cricket]] in Australia for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]]. His nephew and Steve's son, [[Austin Waugh|Austin]], was selected in the [[Australia national under-19 cricket team|Australian under-19 team]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/austin-waugh-will-sutherland-headline-australias-under19-cricket-world-cup-squad/news-story/cdf553030746464fc1d66c53f0c1afcd|title=Waugh, Sutherland headline U19 Cup squad|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en}}</ref> He was previously a national selector, holding that position until August 2018. On 15 May 2018, he announced his intentions to swap national selector duties for a TV commentating role with [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Waugh \u2018quits\u2019 CA in surprise exit |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/mark-waugh-to-quit-australian-selector-role/news-story/75a0a1a7b0a548e363a4f6416dbb2d18 |website=[[News.com.au]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |date=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Key achievements==\nWaugh was primarily a right-handed batsman who batted in the No. 4 position in Test matches. He was also a handy [[seam bowling|medium pace]] bowler, but changed to an [[off-spin]] bowler after back injuries restricted him.<ref name=\"az\">Cashman, pp. 320\u2013323.</ref> Waugh is regarded as one of the best [[slip (cricket)|slip fielders]] ever to play cricket<ref name=\"p127\">Piesse, p. 127.</ref> and held the world record for most Test catches by a non-[[wicketkeeper]] until [[Rahul Dravid]] broke it in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283548.html|title=Most catches in career \u2013 ESPN CricInfo|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe began as an [[all-rounder]] in the Australian ODI team, but he later focussed on batting and progressed to opening the batting, where he excelled and became Australia's leading one day runscorer. His three centuries at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] made him the first batsman to ever achieve this feat, with the record later equaled by [[Sourav Ganguly]] at the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. A fourth century in the 1999 tournament made him the only Australian to score four centuries and more than 1000 runs in [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] competition. He also became the leading Australian runscorer and century maker in ODIs during the 1999 tournament as well.\n\nWaugh is regarded as one of the most elegant and gifted stroke makers to ever play the game and his stylish strokeplay was likened to that of [[Stan McCabe]], [[Alan Kippax]],<ref>Piesse, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref> [[Victor Trumper]], [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Greg Chappell]].<ref>Perry, p. 298.</ref>\n\nFollowing his debut Test century, Australian coach [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] compared Waugh's elegance to that of [[Archie Jackson]].<ref name=\"k111\"/> [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]] called Waugh the \"best-looking leg-side player I've seen in my time. . . anything drifting into his pads is hit beautifully.\"<ref>Knight, p. 117.</ref>\n\nHis facile grace also led to accusations that he was a \"lazy\" batsman who was vulnerable to soft dismissals.<ref name=\"az\"/><ref name=\"p126\">Piesse, p. 126.</ref>\n\nWaugh is the younger fraternal twin brother<ref>[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/224522.html]</ref> of Steve Waugh,<ref name=\"az\"/> with whom he played for most of his career and also under his captaincy. They hold the record for the most Test and ODI matches in which siblings appeared together.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n==Early years==\n{{Main|Early life of Mark and Steve Waugh}}\nBorn on 2 June 1965 at [[Canterbury Hospital]] in [[Campsie, New South Wales]], Waugh was the second of twin boys born to Rudiger and Beverley Waugh. He arrived four minutes after Steve. His father was a bank official and his mother was a teacher within the New South Wales Department of Education.<ref name=\"born\">Knight, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The family settled in the [[western Sydney]] suburb of [[Panania, New South Wales|Panania]].<ref>Knight, p. 6.</ref> The twins were later joined by two more brothers, Dean and Danny.<ref>Knight, pp. 9, 13.</ref> From an early age, the parents introduced their children to sport.<ref name=\"k8\"/><ref name=\"p348\">Perry, p. 348.</ref> By the age of six, the twins were playing organised [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[tennis]] and cricket. In their first cricket match, the brothers were both dismissed for [[duck (cricket)|ducks]].<ref name=\"k11\">Knight, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe twins came from a sporting family. Their paternal grandfather Edward was a [[greyhound racing|greyhound]] trainer. Raised in the northern coastal town of [[Bangalow]], Edward earned selection for the New South Wales Country team in [[rugby league]].<ref>Knight, p. 7.</ref> He was about to join Eastern Suburbs in the [[New South Wales Rugby League]], but had to give up his career due to family reasons.<ref name=\"k8\">Knight, p. 8.</ref> Rodger was Edward's only son and was promising tennis player, who was ranked eighth in Australia in his junior years and was the state champion at under-14 level.<ref name=\"k8\"/> On the maternal side, Bev was a tennis player who won the under-14 singles at the South Australian Championships. Her eldest brother Dion Bourne was an opening batsman who played for [[Bankstown District Cricket Club|Bankstown]] in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]] and remains the leading runscorer in the club's history.<ref name=\"k8\"/>\n\nThe twins made their first representative cricket team when they were selected the Bankstown District under-10s at the age of eight.<ref name=\"k12\">Knight, p. 12.</ref> In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools' soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team's three goals in the final.<ref name=\"k14\">Knight, p. 14.</ref> They were a key part of their school's consecutive state cricket championships<ref name=\"k14\"/> and were part of school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year.<ref name=\"k15\">Knight, p. 15.</ref> In their final year, Mark was the captain of the state primary school cricket and tennis teams, both of which won the national championships.<ref name=\"p348\"/><ref name=\"k15\"/> The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat.<ref name=\"p348\"/>\n\nBy this time, the increasing time demands led to conflicts between the sports and were in one case delisted from a team due to a conflict of commitments.<ref name=\"k15\"/> The twins progressed to [[East Hills Boys Technology High School]], which had a history of producing Australian international representatives in a number of sports.<ref name=\"k17\">Knight, p. 17.</ref> Aged 13, the twins were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown's first grade team, to trial for the club's under-16 team for the Green Shield and both were selected. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 1979\u201380, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season<ref name=\"k18\">Knight, p. 18.</ref> and achieved the same level in soccer.<ref name=\"k19\">Knight, p. 19.</ref> In 1980\u201381 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season. Mark's performance in the Green Shield saw him selected in Bankstown's under-21 team, still aged 15.<ref>Knight, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> The brothers often won formed a two-man team\u2014in one match, Mark scored a century and then the brothers took 16/85 between them.<ref name=\"k21\">Knight, p. 21.</ref> At the end of 1980, the twins were selected in the state under-16 team for the national carnival, with Mark as vice-captain.<ref name=\"k22\">Knight, p. 22.</ref>\n\nWhen Mark was 16, he grew around one foot in one year. It was a relief, because he had been diagnosed with the repetitive stress injury [[Osgood-Schlatter disease]] at 15 and told that he would not grow any further than his then height of 152&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"k20\">Knight, p. 20.</ref> The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for [[Sydney United|Sydney Croatia]] in the state league and the pair were paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.<ref name=\"k23\">Knight, p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe brothers were promoted to Bankstown's Second XI,<ref name=\"k23\"/> before being selected for the First XI in the 1982\u201383 season, aged 17, both making their debut against Western Suburbs, with Mark making 97 on debut,<ref name=\"k24\">Knight, p. 24.</ref> ending the season with 427 runs at 30.50. This placed him second in his team's aggregates and he contributed 14 wickets at 10.71.<ref name=\"k25\">Knight, p. 25.</ref> By this time, his coaches had already identified the traits by which Mark was to be characterised in his international career, those of apparent laziness and reliable catching.<ref name=\"k26\"/>\n\nThe twins finished high school at the end of 1983.<ref name=\"k27\">Knight, p. 27.</ref> In 1983\u201384, both were members of New South Wales Combined High Schools and the state under-19 team.<ref name=\"k26\">Knight, p. 26.</ref> Mark was named as the player of the series after scoring two centuries.<ref name=\"k27\"/><ref name=\"p349\"/> The brothers were then selected for Australia for the first time. They had been named in the national under-19 team to play a Test and ODI series against the touring Sri Lankan counterparts.<ref name=\"k27\"/> The under-19 series pitted several future international players against one another.<ref name=\"k29\">Knight, p. 29.</ref> Mark scored 123 in the second Test at the [[Adelaide Oval]].<ref name=\"k29\"/>\n\nWaugh did not contemplate going to university; both he and his brother became sports equipment salesmen.<ref name=\"p349\">Perry, p. 349.</ref><ref name=\"k834\">Knight, pp. 31\u201332.</ref> He made his maiden First XI century during the season, scoring 108 against Mosman.<ref name=\"k834\"/>\n\nAt the start of the 1984\u201385 season, the brothers were included in the New South Wales state squad.<ref name=\"k33\">Knight, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Formative professional career==\n\nAt the end of the season, the Waugh twins signed a contract to spend the Australian winter to play for [[Egerton Cricket Club|Egerton]] in the [[Bolton League]] in [[Lancashire]] in [[northern England]]. Each club was allowed to have one professional; Steve was officially designated as such but would split the earnings with Mark. The twins were billeted with a local family.<ref name=\"k36\">Knight, p. 36.</ref> However, during the year, an Australian rebel tour to [[South Africa]] was staged, breaking the boycott against the [[apartheid]] regime. Some players defected from the Australian Test team to play in South Africa. This resulted in [[Dave Gilbert (cricketer)|Dave Gilbert]] being promoted to the national squad, forcing him to forfeit his Esso scholarship, which allowed him to play Second XI cricket in the [[County Championship]].<ref name=\"k37\">Knight, p. 37.</ref> Steve was selected to replace Gilbert with [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], leaving Mark as the lone professional.<ref name=\"k38\">Knight, p. 38.</ref> Waugh struggled at first, but recovered to score six centuries for the season. As a reward for scoring more than 800 runs and taking more than 50 wickets, Waugh's captain, who was a dentist, gave him free service. Waugh eventually finished the season with 1460 runs and 75 wickets, breaking the club runscoring record by more than 200 runs.<ref name=\"k39\">Knight, p. 39.</ref>\n\nWaugh returned to Australia for the 1985\u201386 season, looking to make his First-class debut. He scored 177 against [[Petersham Cricket Club|Petersham]] in just five hours and was selected for the state Second XI. Then, an opportunity arose with further ramifications of the rebel tours of South Africa. A two-year ban on playing state cricket was imposed on the players. This meant that New South Wales was looking for two new opening batsmen, as both [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1961)|Steve Smith]] and [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]] had defected and been banned. Waugh and Taylor were selected to make their [[Sheffield Shield]] debut.<ref name=\"k40\">Knight, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n===First-class cricket===\nWaugh and Mark Taylor opened on debut against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] at [[Hobart]]'s [[TCA Ground]]. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was dismissed for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 in the first innings.<ref name=\"k42\">Knight, p. 42.</ref> He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair overslept on Taylor's 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding driils, forcing the pair to take hundreds of catches.<ref name=\"k43\">Knight, p. 43.</ref> He took his first catch, that of [[Roger Woolley]] on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler [[Merv Hughes]] in the next match against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] and then 17 and a [[run out]] for another duck against the touring [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref>Knight, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> With a First-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped for the next five matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line [[pace bowling|fast bowler]] and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in his first match in the role. They were his first First-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with [[Mike Whitney]],<ref name=\"k45\">Knight, p. 45.</ref> due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings.<ref name=\"k46\">Knight, p. 46.</ref> Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again in the Sheffield Shield final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales' only pacemen and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with [[Greg Dyer]] to help avoid the [[follow on]] with 41.<ref name=\"k47\">Knight, p. 47.</ref> Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season.<ref>Knight, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> He played in one limited overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.<ref name=\"k49\">Knight, p. 49.</ref>\n\nAt this stage of his career, Waugh lived in the shadow of his brother Steve, who was promoted to the Australian team at the age of 20. As a result, Mark was sometimes called ''Afghan'', a reference to the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], sometimes dubbed the \"forgotten war\".<ref name=\"az\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=The last of cricket's cavaliers|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/136774.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=16 February 2004}}</ref> Building up an impressive record at First-class level, Waugh spent two seasons with English county Essex as the team's successor to [[Allan Border]] as an overseas professional.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, he was voted the Sheffield Shield Player of the Year.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nIn mid-1988, Waugh was signed to replace Australian captain Allan Border for a six-week stint as the overseas professional at Essex County Cricket Club in England, after just one full season of Sheffield Shield. Border had to leave before the end of the season because of the Australian tour of [[Pakistan]] and had recommended Waugh, who arrived with high expectations.<ref name=\"kc\">Knight, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Essex were one of the strongest teams in England and Border had scored six centuries that season.<ref name=\"kc\"/> Waugh's debut came in August in a limited overs match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Castle Park Cricket Ground|Colchester]]. After struggling at the start of his innings,<ref name=\"kc\"/> Waugh found his rhythm and reached 103 from only 94 balls, accumulating his second 50 in just 28 balls.<ref name=\"k66\">Knight, p. 66.</ref> He ended with 15 fours and a six and then took 2/16 with the ball. Waugh played in three First-class matches, scoring 178 runs at 44.50.<ref name=\"k66\"/> His performances were enough to prompt Essex officials to invite him to return for the 1989 season. Waugh accepted, subject to him not being selected for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1989|1989 Ashes tour of England]] with the national side.<ref name=\"k67\">Knight, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn the longer form, Waugh continued to be overlooked and was criticised for his apparently casual attitude.<ref name=\"k77\">Knight, p. 77.</ref> Simpson, now the Australia coach, criticised Waugh, believing that he was not fully exploiting his talent.<ref name=\"k79\">Knight, p. 79.</ref> He scored only one half-century in the remainder of the First-class season, ending the season with 727 First-class runs at 40.39.<ref name=\"k368\">Knight, p. 368.</ref> He did not take a wicket for the season.<ref name=\"k79\">Knight, p. 79.</ref> He was overlooked for the 1989 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour.<ref name=\"k80\">Knight, p. 80.</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Waugh returned to Essex for his first full season as the overseas professional. He began slowly with a 77 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] being his only score beyond 50 in his first six innings. He then scored 92 and took 3/23 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] and then three fifties in the next six innings, including 89 not out against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. Waugh then broke through for his first First-class county century, scoring 109 at [[Valentines Park|Ilford]] in late June against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], whose pace attack was led by [[Malcolm Marshall]].<ref name=\"k82\">Knight, p. 82.</ref> He then scored 112 not out against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in a one-dayer,<ref name=\"k83\">Knight, p. 83.</ref> but had another lean run in the County Championship, failing to pass 30 in nine consecutive innings.<ref name=\"k84\">Knight, p. 84.</ref> Waugh returned to form with 110 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], before scoring an unbeaten century against Australia in a tour match. He scored 100 from 165 deliveries, while Steve rached his century in 101 balls for Australia.<ref name=\"k85\">Knight, p. 85.</ref> Waugh finished his season with 165 against Leicester. He had scored 1537 runs at 43.91.<ref name=\"k85\"/> He took 31 catches in 24 matches<ref name=\"k362\">Knight, p. 362.</ref> and took 14 wickets at 29.62.<ref name=\"k371\">Knight, p. 371.</ref> Essex finished second in the County Championship, six points behind [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].<ref name=\"k85\"/> They would have won were it not for the 25-point penalty that was incurred for pitch-doctoring.<ref name=\"k84\"/> Essex paid Waugh and his teammates championship-winning bonuses, indicating their belief that they were the rightful champions.<ref name=\"k85\"/> Essex reached the final of the Benson & Hedges Cup against Nottinghamshire. Waugh made 41 from 58 balls before his team lost after conceding the winning runs from the last ball of the match.<ref>Knight, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn the first Sheffield Shield match of the season, Waugh scored 172 from 301 balls, his highest First-class score to date.<ref name=\"k91\">Knight, p. 91.</ref> He hit 20 boundaries. He then struck 42 and took three wickets against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but was overlooked for the Test against New Zealand. He scored 46 and 18 and took 1/31 and 2/34 against Queensland, before striking and unbeaten 100 against Victoria. Despite this Waugh was not selected for the opening phase of the season's ODI tournament.<ref name=\"k92\">Knight, p. 92.</ref> At the start of 1990, he went three innings without passing 30, before striking another unbeaten century against Victoria. New South Wales was then sent in at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Waugh struck 137 from 185 runs on the first day, including a six from [[Peter Sleep]] that narrowly missed the clock tower.<ref name=\"k93\">Knight, p. 93.</ref> The [[Sydney Morning Herald]] opined that \"Waugh would imperiously render them [the fielders] obsolete, going over, between and sometimes through them\".<ref name=\"k94\"/>\n\nWaugh returned to state duty and New South Wales needed to beat Tasmania in their last match to qualify for the final.

Australia lost by one run.<ref name=\"k75\">Knight, p. 75.</ref> Waugh made 32 in the next match against the West Indies, and again Steve was run out while they were batting together.<ref name=\"k75\"/> Waugh was omitted for the next three ODIs but returned to make 12 against Pakistan before scoring 42 from 53 in the final round-robin match against the West Indies. Waugh was omitted for the first final, which Australia won by two runs, before replacing [[Simon O'Donnell]] in the second match. He took two catches in the second match and scored 22 and five as Australia lost both to concede the series. Waugh ended his first international series with 131 runs at 21.83.<ref name=\"k76\">Knight, p. 76.</ref>\n\nWaugh returned to Australia in preparation for the 1989\u201390 season, having been overlooked for the ODI squad for the Nehru Cup in India.<ref name=\"k90\">Knight, p. 90.</ref> At the start of the season, the Australian selectors wanted Waugh to tighten up before he could be selected for Tests.

He was dropped from the ODI team in the early part of the season, then omitted from the Test team in favour of [[Tom Moody]] for the fifth Test against [[India national cricket team|India]] in Perth. Following his recall to the ODI team in place of the injured Bruce Reid, Waugh scored only 20 runs at 6.67.\n\nHe was part of the team that failed to make the semi-finals of the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], but did not play the entire tournament due to his poor form. After scoring two in the opening match against New Zealand at [[Eden Park]], he was dropped for three games, then played in the last four matches. His best effort was an unbeaten 66 from 39 balls against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at [[Bellerive Oval]]. On the tour of Sri Lanka that followed, Waugh returned to the Test team and scored five and 56 in the first Test but followed it with four consecutive ducks.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nA score of 112 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in the second Test of 1992\u201393 helped set up an Australian victory and a 1\u20130 lead in the Frank Worrell Trophy series against the West Indies. During that season's [[World Series Cup]], he scored a half-century and took 5/24 as Australia successfully defended a small total.\n\n===ODI opener===\nAfter two unproductive Tests on the 1993 New Zealand tour, Waugh was dropped for the third Test, this time in favour of the younger Damien Martyn. In the ODI series, Australia opted for a new strategy and promoted Waugh to open the batting. He scored 60 and 57 in the first two matches to help set up an Australian victory, then scored his maiden ODI century, 108 in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. A score of 83 in the final match made him the leading batsman of the series with 308 runs at 61.60. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the second Test at [[Lord's]]\u2014the spiritual home of cricket\u2014 Waugh started on six one the second morning scored quickly to reach 99. He was looking for his century during an over by [[Phil Tufnell]]. Tufnell was employing his customary defensive approach of pitching the ball outside the leg stump with a leg side field. The first ball was a half-volley and Waugh hit it straight from the middle of the bat. However, the ball hit the short leg fielder in the shins. Later in the over, another leg side ball hit his pads, rolled between his legs and onto the stumps, meaning that Waugh missed out on his century.<ref>Knight, p. 164.</ref>\n\nTufnell dismissed him more than ten times in Test matches utilising this tactic. A century against New Zealand in Hobart brought Waugh's total to 987 Test runs for the calendar year.\n\n===Bribery claims===\nStarting 1994 well, Waugh was named Player of the Finals against South Africa in the World Series Cup and he then scored a century against the same opponents in the drawn third Test in [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead|Durban]]. Later in the year, Waugh claimed that Pakistan captain [[Saleem Malik]] had offered him (along with [[Tim May]] and [[Shane Warne]]) money to perform poorly during a match on the tour of Pakistan. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Waugh's performances were beyond reproach: he scored three half-centuries in the Tests and an ODI century during the match in question.\n\nIn the first Test of 1994\u201395, Waugh hit his highest score yet,<ref name=\"testlist\">{{cite web| title= Statsguru \u2013 ME Waugh \u2013 Tests \u2013 Innings by innings list | url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1985;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1985-12-26;start=1985-12-26;enddefault=2004-01-06;end=2004-01-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> 140 against England in [[Brisbane]].<ref>Piesse, p. 224.</ref> In the second innings, Australia was seeking quick runs to set up a declaration.

Australia went on to win the Test and Waugh contributed 71 and 29 in another win in [[Melbourne]].\n\nWaugh failed to pass 25 in the rain-affected draw in the third Test in Sydney, before claiming career-best bowling figures of 5/40 in a losing team during the second innings of the fourth Test in [[Adelaide]].<ref>Piesse, p. 234.</ref><ref>Knight, p. 201</ref> In the fifth Test at the WACA, Waugh scored 88 in the first innings before returning as a [[runner (cricket)|runner]] for the injured [[Craig McDermott]].

This came during a 116-run partnership with his brother, noted for a particularly menacing spell by [[Allan Donald]] with the second new ball, repeatedly hitting the twins.<ref name=\"Piesse, p. 229\">Piesse, p. 229.</ref><ref>Knight, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref> He batted out the entire fifth day for an unbeaten 115 in the third Test at the Adelaide Oval to deny the South Africans a victory and win the series for Australia.<ref name=\"Piesse, p. 229\"/> Having scored 63 in the first innings, Waugh came the crease late on the fourth day with Australia at 2/17 and attempting to survive for a draw. He was dropped early and was 11 at stumps. Waugh continued to resist on the following day and brought up his century. Struck by a bouncer from [[Shaun Pollock]] late on the final day, Waugh broke the stumps with his bat while walking away, so South Africa appealed for hit wicket, which was denied.<ref>Knight, pp. 265\u2013266.</ref> South African skipper [[Hansie Cronje]] later speared a [[stump (cricket)|stump]] through the umpires' dressing room in anger at the decision.<ref>Piesse, pp. 143\u2013144.</ref> It was only the second time in his career that he had scored consecutive centuries. Waugh took satisfaction in the fact that his century was responsible for saving the Test.<ref name=\"k267\"/> He finished the series with 279 runs at 69.75.<ref name=\"testlist\"/>\n\nThe 1997\u201398 Australian season marked a change in Waugh's ODI career. The Australian selectors changed their policy and picked Test and ODI teams separately, with specialists chosen accordingly in either form of the game. Waugh's captain and opening partner Taylor was dropped.<ref name=\"Knight, p. 263\"/> Australia had trouble finding a suitable partner for Waugh, with [[Michael di Venuto]], Tom Moody and [[Stuart Law]] all trialled as his opening partner. Despite the instability, Waugh compiled 104 to help Australia successfully chase a target against New Zealand in a round-robin match at the Adelaide Oval.<ref>Knight, p. 264.</ref> He finished the series as Australia's leading runscorer with 320 runs at 35.55,<ref name=\"k265\"/> and took seven wickets at 25.43.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> During the finals series, new wicketkeeper [[Adam Gilchrist]] was elevated to the opening position. The new combination got off to a poor start, with Waugh run out for three in a mix-up in the first final,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}<ref name=\"k265\">Knight, p. 265.</ref> but the pair went on to become Australia's long term opening pair.<ref name=\"k267\">Knight, p. 267.</ref> After losing all four group matches to South Africa,<ref name=\"p356\">Perry, p. 356.</ref> Australia won the finals series 2\u20131.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> The partnership with Gilchrist marked a shift in Waugh's role in ODIs. Waugh had previously been more aggressive while Taylor was his partner, but with the naturally aggressive Gilchrist as his partner, Waugh tended to anchor the innings.<ref name=\"k267\"/>\n\nWaugh's strong start to the year continued in two brief ODI series in New Zealand and India, in which he scored 374 runs at 41.56 respectively, with three half-centuries.<ref name=\"odilist\"/> Australia lost the first two Tests in India, with Waugh scoring 66 in the first innings in the first Test in [[Chennai]] but otherwise failing to pass 20.<ref>Knight, pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> In the third Test in [[Bangalore]], Waugh scored his highest Test score of 153 not out while suffering nausea, vomiting and fever.

He regarded it as the most difficult day of his career.<ref>Knight, pp. 279\u2013280.</ref> In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 51 and was given a standing ovation by some parts of the crowd in contrast to other hostile sections.

After being dropped before he had scored, Waugh scored 121 in five hours on the first day, sharing a partnership of 190 with his brother. He became the fifth Australian to take 100 Test catches when he caught [[Nasser Hussain]] in the first innings from the bowling of [[Colin Miller (cricketer)|Colin Miller]]. Australia won the Test and Waugh ended the series with 393 runs at 56.14, placing him second in the batting averages.<ref>Knight, p. 283.</ref> In the ODI series, he scored six consecutive half-centuries in a consistent run that augured well for the upcoming World Cup.<ref name=\"odilist\">{{cite web| title= Statsguru \u2013 ME Waugh \u2013 ODIs \u2013 Innings by innings list | url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1985;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1985-12-26;start=1985-12-26;enddefault=2004-01-06;end=2004-01-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> His tally of 542 runs at 49.27 was the highest for the tournament.

He then made 217 runs at 31.00 in the ODIs, Australia's second highest runscorer, before the team headed to England for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]].<ref>Knight, pp. 290\u2013291.</ref>\n\nWaugh started the tournament with a Man of the Match 67 against [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] in [[Worcester]] as Australia unconvincingly won by four wickets in its first match. He then scored two and 41 as Australia lost to New Zealand and Pakistan respectively, leaving them needing to avoid defeat in all of their remaining matches to win the World Cup.<ref>Knight, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> Waugh scored only 33 and three as Australia defeated [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] and the West Indies to progress to the Super Six phase. Needing to win all their matches, Waugh top-scored with 83 against India at The Oval in a win. He then scored 104 from 120 balls against Zimbabwe at Lord's in another victory. In the process, he passed Allan Border's Australian record of 6,524 ODI career runs and became the first person to score four centuries in World Cup competition. He dedicated this achievement to his dying grandfather. He was then run out for five in the final Super Six match against South Africa.<ref>Knight, p. 293.</ref> In the semi-final against same team, he was dismissed without scoring. Waugh participated in the final play of the match.

He finished the tournament with 375 runs at 41.67, making him Australia's second highest runscorer for the tournament.<ref>Knight, p. 297.</ref>\n\nIn late 1999, Australia toured Sri Lanka.

Note the spike near the end of his career due to the 2000\u201301 series.]]\nAfter the being close to omission the previous season, Waugh made a good start to the 2000\u201301 season, scoring 119 against the West Indies in the second Test in Perth. He added two further half-centuries to total 339 runs at 48.4 as the Windies were defeated 5\u20130. His productive summer continued in the limited overs format when he went on to score an Australian ODI record of 173 in the second tri-series final against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was one of three ODI centuries he scored in that tournament, the others being a 112 and 102, both not out, against the West Indies and Zimbabwe respectively. In total he scored 540 runs in the series at an average of 108.00. As the leading runscorer by far in the tournament, he was expected to be named Player of the Series, resulting in widespread crowd jeering when it was instead awarded to [[Brian Lara]]. Waugh was also tipped to win the [[Allan Border Medal]] due to his prolific runscoring that year. However, despite leading the player votes with 32, the umpire and media thought otherwise, awarding Steve Waugh 37 votes to his 32, making Steve the winner 65\u201364.\n\nThe 2001 tour of India saw Australia's 16 Test winning streak come to an end when India claimed the series 2\u20131. Waugh scored 70 and 57 in the third Test in Chennai to finish with 149 runs at 29.80 in a difficult series. Waugh continued his fine ODI form with another century, an unbeaten 133 against India in the second ODI, but was forced to return home after his finger was fractured by a [[Javagal Srinath]] delivery.\n\n===Catching world record===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}\nDuring the 2001 Ashes series, Waugh topped the aggregates with 430 runs, scoring Test centuries at Lord's (108) and The Oval (120). He broke Mark Taylor's world record of 157 Test catches. Waugh was unable to maintain this form in the 2001\u201302 Australian summer: he totalled 269 (at 33.6) in six Tests against New Zealand and South Africa, without a century. Media scrutiny of his inability to combat short-pitched bowling increased and led to speculation about his long-term future in the team.\n\nNevertheless, he passed two major milestones: the Test at Adelaide marked the 100th Test in which both Waughs played, while the following game was his 100th consecutive Test match. Waugh and fellow ODI opener Adam Gilchrist both hit a batting slump during the VB series, with Waugh averaging 26 for the series and Gilchrist less. Frequent poor starts to the innings resulted in Australia's failure to qualify for the final of the tri-series for the first time in five years. Later in the year, the selectors reacted by dropping Steve and Mark Waugh, the oldest members of the team, in favour of younger players.\n\n===Final series===\nMaintaining his place in the Test team, Waugh toured South Africa in early 2002. Although he passed 15 in each of his innings, he managed only one half-century in his 169 runs at 33.8. In an attempt to regain form, he had a brief stint with Essex in the English County Championship. In the subsequent three-Test series against Pakistan, played on neutral grounds in Sri Lanka and the [[United Arab Emirates]] due to security reasons, he made only 80 runs at 20. Waugh retired from international cricket in late 2002 after being omitted for the upcoming Test series against England in favour of Darren Lehmann.\n\nWaugh retired as Australia's highest run scorer and century maker (18) in ODI cricket, with these records having since been broken by [[Ricky Ponting]]. His world record of 181 Test catches was broken by India's Rahul Dravid in 2009.\n\n[[Image:Mark Waugh Graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Mark Waugh's Test career batting performance graph.]]\n\n==Fielding==\nWaugh took a record 181 catches in Test matches, the second highest for a non wicketkeeper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} He primarily fielded in the second slip position whilst a fast bowler was operating. He would field at silly point whilst a spin bowler was operating and then at first slip for a spinner following the retirement of Mark Taylor. Additionally, he would field at mid-wicket or short mid-wicket when he was not required in a close catching position and also during ODIs.\n\n==Involvement with bookmakers==\nIn 1993, Waugh was a member of the Australian team competing in the [[Hong Kong Sixes]]; one of the Indian team was Test all-rounder [[Manoj Prabhakar]].<ref>Knight, p. 171.</ref> A report by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] in 2000 implicated Prabhakar for acting as a conduit for bookmakers involved in illegal cricket betting, which resulted in Prabhakar receiving a five-year suspension from the game. The report also documented allegations by Indian bookmaker Mukesh Gupta that Prabhakar had introduced him to Waugh during the tournament and that Waugh was paid A$20,000 for insider information about the Australian team, pitch conditions and weather information.\n\nWhen the allegations were made public by the report in November 2000, Waugh immediately pledged to co-operate with any inquiry. In January 2001, the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit and the ACB's special investigator Greg Melick requested an interview with Waugh, which his management \"presently declined\". Waugh received legal advice to seek further clarification of the scope of the investigation. After condemnation from the ACB and media, and the possibility of losing his contract with the ACB, Waugh agreed to the interview.<ref>Knight, pp. 309\u2013306.</ref> He was cleared in August 2001.<ref>Knight, p. 327.</ref>\n\nDuring the Singer World Series tournament, played in Sri Lanka during September 1994,  Waugh made a decision which came back to affect his career four years later. He was approached in [[Colombo]] by an Indian named \"[[John (bookmaker)|John]]\", a bookmaker who asked him for general pitch and weather information as well as insider team information. In return, Waugh received US$4,000. The arrangement continued during the 1994\u201395 Australian summer, but he refused to divulge inside team information. Waugh introduced \"John\" to Shane Warne.<ref>Knight, pp. 184\u2013186.</ref>\n\nOn the 1994 tour of Pakistan, Waugh claimed that along with Warne and Tim May, he was offered A$200,000 to underperform by Pakistan captain Saleem Malik. The offer was in regard to an ODI played in Rawalpindi on 22 October. Waugh says he rejected the bribe and went on to score 121* from 134 deliveries in the match.<ref>Knight, pp. 188\u2013190.</ref> The trio signed a statement in early 1995 stating their claims, which were forwarded to the ICC.<ref>Knight, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> In October 1995, a Pakistan Cricket Board inquiry led by former Pakistan Supreme Court judge [[Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim]] ruled that the allegations, \"are not worthy of any credence and must be rejected as unfounded\". Further, he stated that they \"appear to have been concocted\".<ref name=\"Knight, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nHowever, during the 1998 tour of Pakistan, the issue was again raised, as the [[Government of Pakistan]] had initiated a separate judicial inquiry into general issues regarding the performance of the Pakistani team and allegations of illegal betting by past and former players. Waugh, along with his captain Mark Taylor and ACB CEO [[Malcolm Speed]], were summoned to [[Lahore]] by PCB CEO [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]] to appear before an inquiry led by Justice [[Malik Mohammed Qayyum]].<ref>Knight, pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, prior to the Adelaide Test match against England, news broke that Waugh and Warne were involved with \"John\" four years earlier and had been fined by the ACB. Both players were required to make public statements acknowledging that they had been, \"naive and stupid\" and reasserting that they were not involved in corruption.

Following the merger, the police forces of the princely states united as of January, 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.rajasthan.gov.in/Rajpolice/History.aspx|title=Rajasthan Police|first=Design: / Modified: Your|last=Name|website=www.police.rajasthan.gov.in}}</ref>\n\n== Recruitment and service ==\nRecruitment is generally through the [[Rajasthan Public Service Commission]] (RPSC), which conducts a state-level examination called [[Rajasthan Administrative Service]]/Sub-ordinate Services Exam (RAS).

The state is further divided into 40 districts (including 3 rural districts, 2 city districts in Jaipur City and 2 railway police districts), 171 circles, 709 police stations and 788 out-posts. The force had 889 Inspectors, 3366 Sub-Inspectors, 3902 Asst. Sub-Inspectors, 8867 Head Constables and 52,837 Constables and about 700 [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) and [[Rajasthan Police Service]] (RPS) officers.\n\n==Rajasthan Armed Constabulary==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Confusing|date=June 2018}}\nSoon after independence, the law and order situation along the 1070&nbsp;km Indo-Pakistani border became a serious problem. Incursions and cattle lifting by Pakistani raiders was a regular feature and it became imperative to put an end to it. In 1949-50, the duty of guarding the border was handed over to the joint forces of the Central Reserve Police and the Provincial Armed Constabulary, which continued until 1952. In 1952, the [https://www.indiagovjob.site/rajasthan-police-recruitment-2019/ Government of Rajasthan] decided to raise a special force that could not only be deployed along the border but also assist the civil police in combating the dacoity menace. The first headquarters and training centre was established at Bharatpur in 1952 and five battalions received training there. These men, some ex-soldiers drawn from the State forces and some from places outside Rajasthan, were a part of the first 5 battalions of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary. Each battalion consisted of 6 companies and one company remained at the battalion headquarters. These battalions were then dispatched to the border areas of Sriganganagar, Raisinghnagar, Barmer, and Jaisalmer. One unit was stationed at Ghat Gate, Jaipur to check dacoity. Within a year of its inception, the RAC proved its worth both on the border and within the State by successfully carrying out its various duties. The members of RAC displayed gallantry and high sense of morale on occasions that required courage, perseverance, and devotion to duty. Its men battled against all odds, combating not only the enemy but also facing the rigours of the desert areas devoid even of the bare necessities of life. The RAC continued as a temporary force until 1958, there after it was made permanent. From that year up to the late 1970s more battalions of RAC were raised as per the situation and the need. India saw two wars with Pakistan and one with China and there was unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, NEFA, as well as Mizoram. RAC battalions were dispatched to these sensitive areas and earned accolades for their courage and efficiency. In 1962, two companies were taken out of each unit and the 6th Battalion was formed. More battalions followed in the subsequent years. Later, seven of these RAC battalions were merged with the Border Security Force and two with the Central Reserve Police Force. Over a period of time, increasing criminal tendencies, subversive political activities, communalism and violence, have all led to the worsening of the law and order situation all over the country. Rajasthan could not remain unaffected. Hence, the need was felt to create a special task force, familiar with modern techniques necessary to deal effectively with communal disturbances. In 1998, a Special Task Force, along the lines of the Rapid Action Force of C.R.P.F., was formed to maintain peace in the sensitive districts of Rajasthan. These companies are trained and fully equipped to handle riots. The training imparted to the select RAC companies is decided as per requirements. There are 3 companies of RAC, which have drawn expert swimmers from various R.A.C. battalions and are being trained for flood relief work. The 67 years of RAC's existence have been full of legendary stories, of heroic encounters, of gallant men and their dare devilry. One story that is still related with considerable pride is about the unforgettable encounter with dacoits in Thor village of Dholpur - it lasted for 18 hours. The outcome? thirteen dacoits held and no casualties on the RAC side. As on today fifteen battalions of RAC including one special battalion formed by only Ladies Constables Specially trained Unit named Hadi Rani Mahila Battalian and one battalion of MBC are there in the State as Statepara-military force.

The reconstruction of police was a step towards the improvement of the administration of [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|criminal justice]] in India. Rajasthan was formed by the merger of the erstwhile princely states. The security and the police forces of the former princely states varied in composition, functions and administrative procedures. Following the merger, the police forces of the princely states united as of January, 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.rajasthan.gov.in/Rajpolice/History.aspx|title=Rajasthan Police|first=Design: / Modified: Your|last=Name|website=www.police.rajasthan.gov.in}}</ref>\n\n== Recruitment and service ==\nRecruitment is generally through the [[Rajasthan Public Service Commission]] (RPSC), which conducts a state-level examination called [[Rajasthan Administrative Service]]/Sub-ordinate Services Exam (RAS). After passing the exam, recruits undergo training at [[RPA Jaipur]] and [[Rajasthan Police Training Centre|RPTC]]. They are governed by Rajasthan Service Rules. The nine organisational units are Crime branch, Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC), State Special Branch, Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS), Planning and Welfare, Training, Forensic Science laboratory, Telecommunications and Traffic Police.\n\nAs of 2014 the Rajasthan Police employed 82,193 persons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crime in Rajasthan 2014|url=http://police.rajasthan.gov.in/CIR2014.pdf|website=police.rajasthan.gov.in|publisher=State Crime Records Bureau, Rajasthan, Jaipur|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Hierarchy===\n\n'''Officers'''\n\n* Director General of Police (DGP)\n* Additional Director General of Police \n* Inspector General of Police (IGP)\n* Deputy Inspector General of Police \n* Senior Superintendent of Police \n* Superintendent of Police (SP)\n* Additional Superintendent of Police \n* Assistant SP ([[Indian Police Service|IPS]]) or Deputy SP (RPS)\n\n'''Sub-ordinates'''\n* Inspector of Police \n* Sub-Inspector of Police \n* Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police \n* Head Constable \n* Senior Constable \n* Constable\n\n==Present scenario==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nOver the years Rajasthan Police has firmly and professionally dealt with bandits ([[dacoit]]s) in the [[Chambal Division|Chambal]] ravines, organised crime, spies, smugglers, narco-terrorists and subversive elements from across the {{convert|1040|km}} long border with [[Pakistan]]. The Rajasthan Police is headed by the [[Director General of Police]] (DGP). Rajasthan is divided into 2 police commissionerate, 7 police range each headed by an [[Inspector General of Police]] (IGP). The state is further divided into 40 districts (including 3 rural districts, 2 city districts in Jaipur City and 2 railway police districts), 171 circles, 709 police stations and 788 out-posts. The force had 889 Inspectors, 3366 Sub-Inspectors, 3902 Asst. Sub-Inspectors, 8867 Head Constables and 52,837 Constables and about 700 [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) and [[Rajasthan Police Service]] (RPS) officers.\n\n==Rajasthan Armed Constabulary==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Confusing|date=June 2018}}\nSoon after independence, the law and order situation along the 1070&nbsp;km Indo-Pakistani border became a serious problem. Incursions and cattle lifting by Pakistani raiders was a regular feature and it became imperative to put an end to it. In 1949-50, the duty of guarding the border was handed over to the joint forces of the Central Reserve Police and the Provincial Armed Constabulary, which continued until 1952. In 1952, the [https://www.indiagovjob.site/rajasthan-police-recruitment-2019/ Government of Rajasthan] decided to raise a special force that could not only be deployed along the border but also assist the civil police in combating the dacoity menace. The first headquarters and training centre was established at Bharatpur in 1952 and five battalions received training there. These men, some ex-soldiers drawn from the State forces and some from places outside Rajasthan, were a part of the first 5 battalions of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary. Each battalion consisted of 6 companies and one company remained at the battalion headquarters. These battalions were then dispatched to the border areas of Sriganganagar, Raisinghnagar, Barmer, and Jaisalmer. One unit was stationed at Ghat Gate, Jaipur to check dacoity. Within a year of its inception, the RAC proved its worth both on the border and within the State by successfully carrying out its various duties. The members of RAC displayed gallantry and high sense of morale on occasions that required courage, perseverance, and devotion to duty. Its men battled against all odds, combating not only the enemy but also facing the rigours of the desert areas devoid even of the bare necessities of life. The RAC continued as a temporary force until 1958, there after it was made permanent. From that year up to the late 1970s more battalions of RAC were raised as per the situation and the need. India saw two wars with Pakistan and one with China and there was unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, NEFA, as well as Mizoram. RAC battalions were dispatched to these sensitive areas and earned accolades for their courage and efficiency. In 1962, two companies were taken out of each unit and the 6th Battalion was formed. More battalions followed in the subsequent years. Later, seven of these RAC battalions were merged with the Border Security Force and two with the Central Reserve Police Force. Over a period of time, increasing criminal tendencies, subversive political activities, communalism and violence, have all led to the worsening of the law and order situation all over the country. Rajasthan could not remain unaffected. Hence, the need was felt to create a special task force, familiar with modern techniques necessary to deal effectively with communal disturbances. In 1998, a Special Task Force, along the lines of the Rapid Action Force of C.R.P.F., was formed to maintain peace in the sensitive districts of Rajasthan. These companies are trained and fully equipped to handle riots. The training imparted to the select RAC companies is decided as per requirements. There are 3 companies of RAC, which have drawn expert swimmers from various R.A.C. battalions and are being trained for flood relief work. The 67 years of RAC's existence have been full of legendary stories, of heroic encounters, of gallant men and their dare devilry. One story that is still related with considerable pride is about the unforgettable encounter with dacoits in Thor village of Dholpur - it lasted for 18 hours. The outcome? thirteen dacoits held and no casualties on the RAC side. As on today fifteen battalions of RAC including one special battalion formed by only Ladies Constables Specially trained Unit named Hadi Rani Mahila Battalian and one battalion of MBC are there in the State as Statepara-military force. Out of these 14 battalions of RAC, 11 battalions are deployed in Rajasthan while 3 are in Delhi.\n\n===All units===\n*First Battalion \u2013 [[Jodhpur]]\n*Second Battalion \u2013 [[Kota district|Kota]]\n*Third Battalion \u2013 [[Bikaner district|Bikaner]]\n*Fourth Battalion \u2013 [[Jaipur]]\n*Fifth Battalion \u2013 [[Jaipur]]\n*Sixth Battalion \u2013 [[Dholpur district|Dholpur]]\n*Seventh Battalion \u2013 [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]]\n*Eighth Battalion \u2013 [[Delhi]]\n*Ninth Battalion \u2013 [[Tonk, Rajasthan|Tonk]]\n*Tenth Battalion \u2013 [[Bikaner district|Bikaner]]\n*Eleventh Battalion \u2013 [[Delhi]]\n*Twelfth Battalion \u2013 [[Delhi]]\n*Thirteenth Battalion \u2013 Jail Security\n*Fourteenth Battalion \u2013 [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]]\n\n== See also==\n* [[Mewar Bhil Corps]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://police.rajasthan.gov.in/ Rajasthan Police official website]\n{{Rajasthan}}\n\n{{Law enforcement in India}}\n\n[[Category:Rajasthan Police]]\n[[Category:State law enforcement agencies of India]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1951]]\n", "name_user": "Arvindjpr05", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Police"}

He was born in the United Kingdom, and lived the majority of his life in [[Australia]]. Before adopting the on-air name of Ugly Phil he was known on-air as Phil O'Neil. Phil has hosted the [[Hot30 Countdown]], Drive at [[Nova 969]], and Evenings at [[Triple M]] several times.\n\nPhil also hosted a National Charts Show across the major and regional markets (\"Ugly Phil's Hot Hits\") previously known and currently known as ''[[The Hot Hits Live from LA|The Hot Hits]]'' before and after his association with presenting the show. From December 2008 \u2013 June 2009, he was the co-host on the breakfast shift of [[2MMM|Triple M Sydney]] with [[Sami Lukis]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Early Years \u2013 The Hot30 Countdown====\nIn 1993\u201394 he hosted a nightly program with his now ex-wife [[Jackie O (radio host)|Jackie O]] (aka, Jackie Last) on [[Triple M]] in [[Adelaide]] called \"Phil O'Neil's Hot 30\". [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|FOX FM]] snapped him up later, where he and his wife moved their popular show onto Melbourne's airwaves where it was renamed the [[Hot 30 Countdown]]. When the [[Austereo]] network decided to syndicate the show nationally, Phil and Jackie O moved to Sydney, where the show was broadcast locally on [[2Day FM]] and across the other 5 major Australian radio markets owned by Austereo, [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|FOX FM]] Melbourne, [[SA FM]] Adelaide, [[B105 FM|B105]] Brisbane, [[NXFM]] Newcastle, and [[104.7 (Canberra)|FM 104.7]] Canberra.\n\nThe Hot 30 would air between 7-10pm Monday to Friday. But on average the show go onto 10.30&nbsp;pm, frustrating the host of the following shift, which was loved by Phil's listeners.\nDuring the Hot 30 between 1998 and 2000 \"Ugly Phil\" would often call unaware late night shop attendants at petrol stations and convenience stores and random places, with prank calls. The pranks often entailed using an \"Asian accent\" [\"you eat my dog... Why you eat my dog\"] or he would call and the first thing he would say was [\"Who are you?...Who are you?\"]\n\nPrior to his Hot 30 days, Phil worked at [[New FM]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n====Nova 969====\nAfter leaving Austereo he worked briefly in the United Kingdom for [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]], before moving back to Australia to host drive on the newly launched [[Nova 969]] in Sydney. Ugly Phil had the highest rating shift on Nova in the drive timeslot. Ugly Phil left this position around the end of 2002, citing management difficulties.\n\n====2003: Return to Austereo====\nIn 2003, he signed onto evenings on the [[Triple M]] network \u2013 ditching the 'Ugly' name and opting for ''The Phil O'Neil Show''. The program included interviews, prizes and lighthearted talkback \u2013 which was a first for the Triple M network. However, the experiment didn't pay off and Ugly Phil's contract was not renewed at the end of 2003 due to falling ratings and another overhaul of the network.\n\n====2004: Return to the UK====\nIn 2004, it was announced he would front the breakfast shift on the newly licensed [[Kerrang! 105.2|Kerrang Radio 105.2]], in [[Birmingham]], United Kingdom with the Ugly put back onto the front of his name. This program was co-hosted by Rachel New. As of September 2007, Ugly Phil's Breakfast program has ceased, replacing his program with ''[[The Morning After (radio show)|The Morning After]]'' starring [[Tim Shaw (presenter)|Tim Shaw]] and [[Kate Lawler]], [[Big Brother (TV series)]] 3 UK winner, in the Breakfast shift. During the autumn of 2007, Phil could be heard covering at weekends on London's indie station [[XFM]], leading to him fronting the weekday breakfast show over Christmas and New Year, filling in for [[Alex Zane]].\n\n====July 2008: Triple M Nights====\nIn July 2008 he returned to Australian airwaves hosting a night time show on Triple M Sydney once again.

He was born in the United Kingdom, and lived the majority of his life in [[Australia]]. Before adopting the on-air name of Ugly Phil he was known on-air as Phil O'Neil. Phil has hosted the [[Hot30 Countdown]], Drive at [[Nova 969]], and Evenings at [[Triple M]] several times.\n\nPhil also hosted a National Charts Show across the major and regional markets (\"Ugly Phil's Hot Hits\") previously known and currently known as ''[[The Hot Hits Live from LA|The Hot Hits]]'' before and after his association with presenting the show. From December 2008 \u2013 June 2009, he was the co-host on the breakfast shift of [[2MMM|Triple M Sydney]] with [[Sami Lukis]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Early Years \u2013 The Hot30 Countdown====\nIn 1993\u201394 he hosted a nightly program with his now ex-wife [[Jackie O (radio host)|Jackie O]] (aka, Jackie Last) on [[Triple M]] in [[Adelaide]] called \"Phil O'Neil's Hot 30\". [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|FOX FM]] snapped him up later, where he and his wife moved their popular show onto Melbourne's airwaves where it was renamed the [[Hot 30 Countdown]]. When the [[Austereo]] network decided to syndicate the show nationally, Phil and Jackie O moved to Sydney where the show was broadcast locally on [[2Day FM]] and across the other 5 major Australian radio markets owned by Austereo, [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|FOX FM]] Melbourne, [[SA FM]] Adelaide, [[B105 FM|B105]] Brisbane, [[NXFM]] Newcastle, and [[104.7 (Canberra)|FM 104.7]] Canberra.\n\nThe Hot 30 would air between 7-10pm Monday to Friday. But on average the show go onto 10.30&nbsp;pm, frustrating the host of the following shift, which was loved by Phil's listeners.\nDuring the Hot 30 between 1998 and 2000 \"Ugly Phil\" would often call unaware late night shop attendants at petrol stations and convenience stores and random places, with prank calls. The pranks often entailed using an \"Asian accent\" [\"you eat my dog... Why you eat my dog\"] or he would call and the first thing he would say was [\"Who are you?...Who are you?\"]\n\nPrior to his Hot 30 days, Phil worked at [[New FM]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n====Nova 969====\nAfter leaving Austereo he worked briefly in the United Kingdom for [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]], before moving back to Australia to host drive on the newly launched [[Nova 969]] in Sydney. Ugly Phil had the highest rating shift on Nova in the drive timeslot. Ugly Phil left this position around the end of 2002, citing management difficulties.\n\n====2003: Return to Austereo====\nIn 2003, he signed onto evenings on the [[Triple M]] network \u2013 ditching the 'Ugly' name and opting for ''The Phil O'Neil Show''. The program included interviews, prizes and lighthearted talkback \u2013 which was a first for the Triple M network. However, the experiment didn't pay off and Ugly Phil's contract was not renewed at the end of 2003 due to falling ratings and another overhaul of the network.\n\n====2004: Return to the UK====\nIn 2004, it was announced he would front the breakfast shift on the newly licensed [[Kerrang! 105.2|Kerrang Radio 105.2]], in [[Birmingham]], United Kingdom with the Ugly put back onto the front of his name. This program was co-hosted by Rachel New. As of September 2007, Ugly Phil's Breakfast program has ceased, replacing his program with ''[[The Morning After (radio show)|The Morning After]]'' starring [[Tim Shaw (presenter)|Tim Shaw]] and [[Kate Lawler]], [[Big Brother (TV series)]] 3 UK winner, in the Breakfast shift. During the autumn of 2007, Phil could be heard covering at weekends on London's indie station [[XFM]], leading to him fronting the weekday breakfast show over Christmas and New Year, filling in for [[Alex Zane]].\n\n====July 2008: Triple M Nights====\nIn July 2008 he returned to Australian airwaves hosting a night time show on Triple M Sydney once again.

After participating in an uprising in Piedmont, he was sentenced to death, but escaped by sailing to South America; he spent 14 years in exile, taking part in several wars and learning the art of guerrilla warfare.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Garibaldi'' (2001)</ref>\nIn 1835, in Brazil, he took up the cause of the [[Riograndense Republic]] in its attempt to proclaim another republic within Santa Catarina, joining the rebels known as the Farrapos. Garibaldi also became involved in the [[Uruguayan Civil War]], raising an Italian force known as [[Redshirts (Italy)| Redshirts]], and is still celebrated as an important contributor to Uruguayan independence.\n\nIn 1848, Garibaldi returned to Italy and commanded and fought in military campaigns that eventually led to Italian unification. The provisional government of [[Milan]] made him a general, and in 1849, the Minister of War promoted him to General of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]]. When the [[Second Italian War of Independence|war of independence]] broke out in April 1859, he led his ''[[Hunters of the Alps]]'' in the capture of [[Battle of Varese|Varese]] and [[Battle of San Fermo|Como]] and reached the frontier of South Tyrol; the war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy. The following year, he led the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on behalf of and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II. The expedition was a success and concluded with the annexation of Sicily, Southern Italy, Marche and Umbria to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], before the creation of a unified Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. His last military campaign took place during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as commander of the [[Army of the Vosges]].\n\nGaribaldi became an international figurehead for national independence and republican ideals.

He participated actively in the [[Nizzardo Italians]] community and was certified in 1832 as a merchant navy captain.\n\nIn April 1833, he travelled to [[Taganrog]], Russia, in the schooner ''Clorinda'' with a shipment of oranges. During ten days in port, he met Giovanni Battista Cuneo from [[Oneglia]], a politically active immigrant and member of the secret [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] movement of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. Mazzini was a passionate proponent of Italian unification as a liberal republic through political and social reform. Garibaldi joined the society and took an oath dedicating himself to the struggle to liberate and unify his homeland from Austrian dominance.\n\nIn [[Geneva]] during November 1833, Garibaldi met Mazzini, starting a long relationship that later became troubled. He joined the [[Carbonari]] revolutionary association, and in February 1834 participated in a failed Mazzinian insurrection in [[Piedmont]]. A Genoese court sentenced Garibaldi to death ''in absentia'', and he fled across the border to [[Marseille]].{{-}}\n\n=== South America ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:The Battle of Sant'Antonio, Uruguay in which Garibaldi participated, in 1846.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi during the battle of Sant'Antonio, 1846]]\n[[File:Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War..jpg|thumb|Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War]]\nGaribaldi first sailed to the [[Beylik of Tunis]] before eventually finding his way to the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Once there, he took up the cause of the [[Riograndense Republic]] in its attempt to separate from Brazil, joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins in the [[Ragamuffin War]] of 1835.\n\nDuring this war he met [[Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro da Silva]], commonly known as Anita. When the Ragamuffins tried to proclaim another republic in the Brazilian province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in October 1839, she joined him aboard his ship, ''Rio Pardo'', and fought alongside him at the battles of Imbituba and Laguna.\n\nIn 1841 Garibaldi and Anita moved to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where Garibaldi worked as a trader and schoolmaster. The couple married in Montevideo the following year. They had four children; [[Menotti Garibaldi|Domenico Menotti]] (1840\u20131903), Rosa (1843\u20131945), Teresa Teresita (1845\u20131903), and [[Ricciotti Garibaldi|Ricciotti]] (1847\u20131924).<ref name=Kleis>{{cite magazine|last = Kleis|first = S.

Around this time he adopted his trademark clothing\u2014the red shirt, [[poncho]], and [[sombrero]] commonly worn by gauchos. \n\nIn 1842 Garibaldi took command of the Uruguayan fleet and raised an [[Italian Legion]] of soldiers\u2014known as [[Redshirts (Italy)| Redshirts]]\u2014for the [[Uruguayan Civil War]]. He aligned his forces with the Uruguayan [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)| Colorados]] led by [[Fructuoso Rivera]], who were aligned with the Argentine [[Unitarian Party]]. This faction received some support from the French and British Empires in their struggle against the forces of former Uruguayan president [[Manuel Oribe]]'s [[National Party (Uruguay)| Blancos]], which was also aligned with Argentine [[Federales (Argentina)|Federales]] under the rule of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] caudillo [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].\n\nThe Italian Legion adopted a black flag that represented Italy in mourning, with a volcano at the center that symbolized the dormant power in their homeland. Though contemporary sources do not mention the Redshirts, popular history asserts that the legion first wore them in Uruguay, getting them from a factory in Montevideo that had intended to export them to the slaughterhouses of Argentina.{{cn|date=May 2019}} These shirts became the symbol of Garibaldi and his followers.\n\nBetween 1842 and 1848, Garibaldi [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|defended Montevideo]] against forces led by Oribe. In 1845 he managed to occupy [[Colonia del Sacramento]] and [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], and led the controversial sack of [[Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos|Gualeguaych\u00fa]] during the [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Adopting guerrilla tactics, Garibaldi later achieved two victories during 1846, in the Battle of Cerro and the Battle of San Antonio del Santo.\n\n=== Induction to Freemasonry ===\nGaribaldi joined Freemasonry during his exile, taking advantage of the asylum the lodges offered to political refugees from European countries governed by despotic regimes. At the age of thirty-seven, during 1844, Garibaldi was initiated in the L'Asil de la Vertud Lodge of Montevideo. This was an irregular lodge under a Brazilian Freemasonry not recognized by the main international masonic obediences, such as the United Grand Lodge of England or the [[Grand Orient de France]].\n\nWhile Garibaldi had little use for Masonic rituals, he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and regarded Freemasonry as a network that united progressive men as brothers both within nations and as a global community. Garibaldi was eventually elected as the Grand Master of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi \u2013 the mason\">[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html Garibaldi \u2013 the mason] Translated from Giuseppe Garibaldi Massone by the Grand Orient of Italy</ref><ref name=\"freemasonry.bcy.ca\">http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html\n\"Garibaldi \u2014 the mason\". Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. & A. M., 2003.</ref>\n\nGaribaldi later regularized his position in 1844, joining the lodge Les Amis de la Patrie of Montevideo under the Grand Orient of France.\n\n==== Election of Pope Pius IX, 1846 ====\nThe fate of his homeland, however, continued to concern Garibaldi. The election of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1846 caused a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile. Pius's initial reforms seemed to identify him as the liberal pope called for by [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], who went on to lead the unification of Italy. When news of these reforms reached Montevideo, Garibaldi wrote to the Pope: {{quote|If these hands, used to fighting, would be acceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of him who deserves so well of the Church and of the fatherland. Joyful indeed shall we and our companions in whose name we speak be, if we may be allowed to shed our blood in defence of Pius IX's work of redemption.<ref>A. Werner, ''Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi'', Vol. III, Howard Fertig, New York (1971) p. 68.</ref>}}\n\nMazzini, from exile, also applauded the early reforms of Pius IX. In 1847, Garibaldi offered the [[apostolic nuncio]] at Rio de Janeiro, Bedini, the service of his Italian Legion for the liberation of the peninsula. Then news of an outbreak of revolution in [[Palermo]] in January 1848 and revolutionary agitation elsewhere in Italy encouraged Garibaldi to lead around sixty members of his legion home.\n\n=== Return to Italy ===\n[[File:Garibaldi divise.jpg|thumb|left|Popular print showing Garibaldi wearing uniforms of 1848, 1859 and 1860 wars.]]\nGaribaldi returned to Italy amidst the turmoil of the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]] and offered his services to [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]]. The monarch displayed some liberal inclinations but treated Garibaldi with coolness and distrust. Rebuffed by the Piedmontese, he and his followers crossed into Lombardy where they offered assistance to the provisional government of Milan, which had rebelled against the Austrian occupation. In the course of the following unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence]], Garibaldi led his legion to two minor victories at [[Luino]] and [[Morazzone]].\n\nAfter the crushing Piedmontese defeat at the [[battle of Novara (1849)|battle of Novara]] on 23 March 1849, Garibaldi moved to Rome to support the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] recently proclaimed in the [[Papal States]]. However, a French force sent by [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] threatened to topple it. At Mazzini's urging, Garibaldi took command of the defence of Rome. In fighting near [[Velletri]], [[Achille Cantoni]] saved his life. After Cantoni's death, during the [[battle of Mentana]], Garibaldi wrote the novel ''Cantoni the Volunteer''.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi assedio di Roma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Garibaldi during the siege of Rome]]\nOn 30 April 1849, the Republican army, under Garibaldi's command, defeated a numerically far superior French army. Subsequently, French reinforcements arrived, and the [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]] began on 1 June. Despite the resistance of the Republican army, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: surrender, continue fighting in the streets, or retreat from Rome to continue resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi, having entered the chamber covered in blood, made a speech favouring the third option, ending with: ''Ovunque noi saremo, sar\u00e0 Roma.''<ref>Hibbert, G. C (1965). ''Garibaldi and his enemies''. London: Longmans. p. 94.</ref> (Wherever we will go, that will be Rome).\n\nThe sides negotiated a truce on 1\u20132 July, Garibaldi withdrew from Rome with 4,000 troops, and an ambition to rouse popular rebellion against the Austrians in central Italy. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the [[Holy See]]'s temporal power. Garibaldi and his forces, hunted by Austrian, French, Spanish, and Neapolitan troops, fled to the north, intending to reach Venice, where the [[repubblica di San Marco|Venetians were still resisting]] the Austrian siege. After an epic march, Garibaldi took temporary refuge in [[San Marino]], with only 250 men having not abandoned him. Anita, who was carrying their fifth child, died near [[Comacchio]] during the retreat.\n\n====North America and the Pacific====\n\nGaribaldi eventually managed to reach [[Porto Venere]], near [[La Spezia]], but the Piedmontese government forced him to emigrate again. He went to [[Tangier]], where he stayed with Francesco Carpanetto, a wealthy Italian merchant. Carpanetto suggested that he and some of his associates finance the purchase of a merchant ship, which Garibaldi would command. Garibaldi agreed, feeling that his political goals were, for the moment, unreachable, and he could at least earn a living.<ref name=\"Autobio\">{{cite book|first=Giuseppe|last=Garibaldi|title=Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi|url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographygi02garigoog|publisher=Walter Smith and Innes|year=1889|pages=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographygi02garigoog/page/n66 54]\u201369}}</ref>\n[[File:Poncho e camicia rossa di Garibaldi - Museo del Risorgimento di Milano.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Garibaldi's poncho and red shirt at the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)|Museum of the Risorgimento]], [[Milan]].]]\nThe ship was to be purchased in the United States, so Garibaldi went to New York, arriving on 30 July 1850. However, the funds for buying a ship were lacking. While in New York, he stayed with various Italian friends, including some exiled revolutionaries. He attended the Masonic lodges of New York in 1850, where he met several supporters of democratic internationalism, whose minds were open to socialist thought, and to giving Freemasonry a strong anti-papal stance.<ref name=\"freemasonry.bcy.ca\"/>\n\nThe inventor [[Antonio Meucci]] employed Garibaldi in his candle factory on [[Staten Island]].<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\">{{cite book|first=Kenneth T.|last=Jackson|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300055368|url-access=registration|publisher=The New York Historical Society and Yale University Press|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300055368/page/451 451]}}</ref> (The cottage on Staten Island where he stayed is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is preserved as the [[Garibaldi Memorial]].) Garibaldi was not satisfied with this, and in April 1851 he left New York with his friend Carpanetto for Central America, where Carpanetto was establishing business operations. They first went to Nicaragua, and then to other parts of the region. Garibaldi accompanied Carpanetto as a companion, not a business partner, and used the name ''Giuseppe Pane''.<ref name=\"Autobio\"/>\n\nCarpanetto went on to [[Lima]], Peru, where a shipload of his goods was due, arriving late in 1851 with Garibaldi. En route, Garibaldi called on revolutionary heroine [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]]. At Lima, Garibaldi was generally welcomed. A local Italian merchant, Pietro Denegri, gave him command of his ship ''Carmen'' for a trading voyage across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Garibaldi took the ''Carmen'' to the [[Chincha Islands]] for a load of [[guano]]. Then on 10 January 1852, he sailed from Peru for [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]], China, arriving in April.<ref name=\"Autobio\"/>\n\nAfter side trips to [[Xiamen]] and [[Manila]], Garibaldi brought the ''Carmen'' back to Peru via the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, passing clear around the south coast of Australia. He visited [[Three Hummock Island]] in the [[Bass Strait]].<ref name=\"Autobio\" /> Garibaldi then took the ''Carmen'' on a second voyage: to the United States via [[Cape Horn]] with copper from Chile, and also wool. Garibaldi arrived in Boston and went on to New York. There he received a hostile letter from Denegri and resigned his command.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />  Another Italian, Captain Figari, had just come to the U.S. to buy a ship and hired Garibaldi to take the ship to Europe. Figari and Garibaldi bought the ''Commonwealth'' in [[Baltimore]], and Garibaldi left New York for the last time in November 1853.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\"/> He sailed the ''Commonwealth'' to London, and then to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] on the [[River Tyne]] for coal.<ref name=\"Autobio\"/>\n\n====Tyneside====\nThe ''Commonwealth'' arrived on 21 March 1854. Garibaldi, already a popular figure on [[Tyneside]], was welcomed enthusiastically by local working men-though the ''Newcastle Courant'' reported that he refused an invitation to dine with dignitaries in the city. He stayed in Huntingdon Place [[Tynemouth]] for a few days,<ref>http://openplaques.org/plaques/8453</ref> and in [[South Shields]] on Tyneside for over a month, departing at the end of April 1854. During his stay, he was presented with an inscribed sword, which his grandson [[Giuseppe Garibaldi II]] later carried as a volunteer in British service in the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>Bell, David.

Using an inheritance from the death of his brother, he bought half of the Italian island of [[Caprera]] (north of [[Sardinia]]), devoting himself to agriculture. In 1859, the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] (also known as the Austro-Sardinian War) broke out in the midst of internal plots at the Sardinian government. Garibaldi was appointed [[major general]] and formed a volunteer unit named the [[Hunters of the Alps]] (''Cacciatori delle Alpi''). Thenceforth, Garibaldi abandoned Mazzini's republican ideal of the liberation of Italy, assuming that only the Piedmontese monarchy could effectively achieve it. He and his volunteers won victories over the Austrians at [[Battle of Varese|Varese]], [[Battle of San Fermo|Como]], and other places.\n\nGaribaldi was, however, very displeased, as his home city of Nice (''Nizza'' in Italian) had surrendered to the French in return for crucial military assistance. In April 1860, as deputy for Nice in the Piedmontese parliament at Turin, he vehemently attacked Cavour for ceding Nice and the [[County of Nice]] (''Nizzardo'') to Louis Napoleon, Emperor of France. In the following years, Garibaldi (with other passionate ''[[Nizzardo Italians]]'') promoted the ''[[Italian irredentism]]'' of his ''Nizza'', even with riots (in 1872).\n\n===Campaign of 1860===\n{{see also|Expedition of the Thousand}}\n[[File:Garibaldi departing on the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860.jpg|left|thumb|Garibaldi departing on the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860]]\nOn 24 January 1860, Garibaldi married 18-year-old Giuseppina Raimondi. Immediately after the wedding ceremony, she informed him that she was pregnant with another man's child and Garibaldi left her the same day.<ref>Hibbert, Christopher. Garibaldi and His Enemies. New York: Penguin Books, 1987. p. 171.</ref> At the beginning of April 1860, uprisings in [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] and [[Palermo]] in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] provided Garibaldi with an opportunity. He gathered about a thousand volunteers \u2013 called ''i Mille'' (the Thousand), or, as popularly known, the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]]&nbsp;\u2013 in two ships named ''Il Piemonte'' and ''Il Lombardo'', and left from [[Genoa]] on 5 May in the evening and landed at [[Marsala]], on the westernmost point of Sicily, on 11 May.\n\n[[File:Battle of Calatafimi.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Calatafimi]]]]\nSwelling the ranks of his army with scattered bands of local rebels, Garibaldi led 800 volunteers to victory over an enemy force of 1500 on the hill of [[Calatafimi-Segesta|Calatafimi]] on 15 May. He used the counter-intuitive tactic of an uphill bayonet charge. He saw that the hill was terraced, and the terraces would shelter his advancing men. Though small by comparison with the coming clashes at Palermo, Milazzo, and Volturno, this battle was decisive in establishing Garibaldi's power in the island. An apocryphal but realistic story had him say to his lieutenant [[Nino Bixio]], \"Here we either make Italy, or we die.\"{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}} In reality, the Neapolitan forces were ill-guided, and most of its higher officers had been bought out.\n\nThe next day, he declared himself [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi|dictator of Sicily]] in the name of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]].  He advanced to the outskirts of Palermo, the capital of the island, and launched a siege on 27 May. He had the support of many inhabitants, who rose up against the garrison\u2014but before they could take the city, reinforcements arrived and bombarded the city nearly to ruins. At this time, a British admiral intervened and facilitated a truce, by which the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Neapolitan]] royal troops and warships surrendered the city and departed. The young Henry Adams -- later to become a distinguished American writer -- visited the city in June and described the situation, along with his meeting with Garibaldi, in a long and vivid letter to his older brother Charles.<ref>J.C. Levenson et al., ''The Letters of Henry Adams, vol. 1:  1858-1868'' (1982) pp. 162-172.</ref> Historians Clough et al. argue that Garibaldi's Thousand were students, independent artisans, and professionals, not peasants. The support given by Sicilian peasants was not out of a sense of patriotism but from their hatred of exploitative landlords and oppressive Neapolitan officials. Garibaldi himself had no interest in social revolution and instead sided with the Sicilian landlords against the rioting peasants.<ref>Shepard B.  Clough et al., ''A History of the Western World'' (1964) p. 948.</ref>\n\n[[File:Garibaldi--Entr\u00e9e \u00e0 Naples.jpg|thumb|left|upright|People cheering as Giuseppe Garibaldi rides into Naples on horseback, 7 September 1860]]\nBy conquering Palermo, Garibaldi had won a signal victory. He gained worldwide renown and the adulation of Italians. Faith in his prowess was so strong that doubt, confusion, and dismay seized even the Neapolitan court. Six weeks later, he marched against Messina in the east of the island, winning a ferocious and difficult battle at Milazzo. By the end of July, only the citadel resisted.\n\n[[File:REALISM MURAL 19TH.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II on the bridge of Teano on 26 October 1860]]\nHaving conquered Sicily, he crossed the [[Strait of Messina]] and marched north. Garibaldi's progress was met with more celebration than resistance, and on 7&nbsp;September he entered the capital city of [[Naples]], by train. Despite taking Naples, however, he had not to this point defeated the Neapolitan army. Garibaldi's volunteer army of 24,000 was not able to defeat conclusively the reorganized Neapolitan army\u2014about 25,000&nbsp;men\u2014on 30 September at the [[Battle of Volturnus (1860)|battle of Volturno]]. This was the largest battle he ever fought, but its outcome was effectively decided by the arrival of the Piedmontese Army.\n\nFollowing this, Garibaldi's plans to march on to Rome were jeopardized by the Piedmontese, technically his ally but unwilling to risk war with France, whose army protected the Pope. The Piedmontese themselves had conquered most of the Pope's territories in their march south to meet Garibaldi, but they had deliberately avoided Rome, capital of the Papal state. Garibaldi chose to hand over all his territorial gains in the south to the Piedmontese and withdrew to Caprera and temporary retirement. Some modern historians consider the handover of his gains to the Piedmontese as a political defeat, but he seemed willing to see Italian unity brought about under the Piedmontese crown. The meeting at [[Teano]] between Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II is the most important event in modern Italian history but is so shrouded in controversy that even the exact site where it took place is in doubt.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi on Caprera....jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Garibaldi on [[Caprera]] island, Sardinia]]\nGaribaldi deeply disliked the Sardinian Prime Minister, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]. To an extent, he simply mistrusted Cavour's pragmatism and ''[[realpolitik]]'', but he also bore a personal grudge for Cavour's trading away his home city of Nice to the French the previous year. On the other hand, he felt attracted toward the Piedmontese monarch, who in his opinion had been chosen by Providence for the liberation of Italy. In his famous meeting with [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at [[Teano]] on 26 October 1860, Garibaldi greeted him as [[King of Italy]] and shook his hand. Garibaldi rode into Naples at the king's side on 7 November, then retired to the rocky island of [[Caprera]], refusing to accept any reward for his services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] (in 1861), he was a very popular figure. The [[39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was named ''Garibaldi Guard'' after him.<ref name=\"Garibaldi Guard\">http://www.civilwarhome.com/italian.htm Civil War Home] \u2013 The Civil War Society's \"Encyclopedia of the Civil War\" \u2013 Italian-Americans in the Civil War.</ref> Garibaldi himself volunteered his services to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Garibaldi was offered a major general's commission in the U. S. Army through the letter from Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] to H. S. Sanford, the U. S. Minister at Brussels, July 17, 1861.<ref>Mack Smith, pp. 69\u201370.</ref> On September 18, 1861, Sanford sent the following reply to Seward:\n\n{{quote|<nowiki>[Garibaldi]</nowiki> said that the only way in which he could render service, as he ardently desired to do, to the cause of the United States, was as Commander-in-chief of its forces, that he would only go as such, and with the additional contingent power\u2014to be governed by events\u2014of declaring the abolition of slavery; that he would be of little use without the first, and without the second it would appear like a civil war in which the world at large could have little interest or sympathy.<ref>Mack Smith, p. 70.</ref>}}\n\nThese conditions could not be met. On August 6, 1863, after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] had been issued, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln, \"Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure\".<ref>Mack Smith, p. 72.</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1861, Garibaldi set up the [[International Legion]] bringing together different national divisions of French, Poles, Swiss, German and other nationalities, with a view not just of finishing the liberation of Italy, but also of their homelands. With the motto \"Free from the [[Alps]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]],\"{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}} the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. Mazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchial government, and continued to agitate for a republic. Garibaldi, frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, organized a new venture. This time, he intended to take on the Papal States.\n\n=== Expedition against Rome ===\n[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas)]]\n[[File:Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif]]\nGaribaldi himself was intensely anti-Catholic and anti-papal. His efforts to overthrow the pope by military action mobilized anti-Catholic support. For example, there were major anti-Catholic riots in his name across Britain in 1862, with the Irish Catholics fighting in defense of their Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald M.

Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Rome and the Pope's seat there, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions. Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed he had the secret support of his government.\n\nIn June 1862, he sailed from Genoa to Palermo to gather volunteers for the impending campaign, under the slogan ''Roma o Morte'' (Rome or Death). An enthusiastic party quickly joined him, and he turned for Messina, hoping to cross to the mainland there. He arrived with a force of around two thousand, but the garrison proved loyal to the king's instructions and barred his passage. They turned south and set sail from [[Catania]], where Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at [[Melito di Porto Salvo|Melito]] on 14 August, and marched at once into the [[Calabria]]n mountains.\n\n[[File:Garibaldi \u00e0 Londres 1864.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi is welcomed by cheering crowds as he arrives in London, England.]]\nFar from supporting this endeavor, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General [[Enrico Cialdini]] dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Emilio Pallavicini, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August, the [[Battle of Aspromonte|two forces met]] in the rugged [[Aspromonte]]. One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, killing a few of the volunteers. The fighting ended quickly, as Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Many of the volunteers were taken prisoner, including Garibaldi, who had been wounded by a shot in the foot. The episode was the origin of a famous Italian [[nursery rhyme]]: ''Garibaldi fu ferito'' (\"Garibaldi was wounded\").\n\nA government steamer took him to a prison at [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]] near [[La Spezia]], where he was held in a sort of honorable imprisonment and underwent a tedious and painful operation to heal his wound. His venture had failed, but he was consoled by Europe's sympathy and continued interest. One historian of the [[American Civil War]] wrote that the distraction created by Garibaldi's wounding, followed by his unequivocal endorsement of the Union cause, was as important as Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in preserving British and French neutrality in the American conflict\u2014thus significantly aiding the Northern cause.<ref>Don H.

The [[Austro-Prussian War]] had broken out, and Italy had allied with [[Prussia]] against the [[Austrian Empire]] in the hope of taking [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] from Austrian rule ([[Third Italian War of Independence]]). Garibaldi gathered again his Hunters of the Alps, now some 40,000 strong, and [[Invasion of Trentino (1866)|led them]] into the [[Trentino]]. He defeated the Austrians at [[battle of Bezzecca|Bezzecca]], and made for [[Trento]].\n\n[[File:Garibaldi at Mentana, 3rd November 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi at Mentana, 3 November 1867]]\n\nThe Italian regular forces were defeated at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] on the sea, and made little progress on land after the disaster of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]]. The sides signed an armistice by which Austria ceded Venetia to Italy, but this result was largely due to Prussia's successes on the northern front. Garibaldi's advance through Trentino was for nought, and he was ordered to stop his advance to Trento. Garibaldi answered with a short telegram from the main square of Bezzecca with the famous motto: ''Obbedisco!'' (\"I obey!\").{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the war, Garibaldi led a political party that agitated for the capture of Rome, the peninsula's ancient capital. In 1867, he again marched on the city, but the Papal army, supported by a French auxiliary force, proved a match for his badly armed volunteers. He was shot in the leg in the [[Battle of Mentana]], and had to withdraw from the Papal territory. The Italian government again imprisoned him for some time, after which he returned to Caprera.\n\n[[File:Garibaldi in Dijon.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi at Dijon]]\n\nIn the same year, Garibaldi sought international support for altogether eliminating the papacy. At the 1867 congress for the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] in [[Geneva]] he proposed: \"The papacy, being the most harmful of all secret societies, ought to be abolished.\"<ref>Giuseppe Guerzoni, ''Garibaldi: con documenti editi e inediti'', Florence, 1882, Vol. 11, 485.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in July 1870, Italian public opinion heavily favored the Prussians, and many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence. After the French garrison was recalled from Rome, the Italian Army [[Capture of Rome|captured the Papal States]] without Garibaldi's assistance. Following the wartime collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan]], Garibaldi, undaunted by the recent hostility shown to him by the men of Napoleon III, switched his support to the newly declared [[French Third Republic]]. On 7 September 1870, within three days of the revolution of 4 September in Paris, he wrote to the ''Movimento'' of Genoa, \"Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 602.</ref> Subsequently, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the [[Army of the Vosges]], an army of volunteers.

In a book review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (9 and 16 July 2007) of a Garibaldi biography, Tim Parks cites the English historian, [[A. J. P.

His name was much more famous than that of Cavour and Mazzini, and many more people would have heard of him than [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] or [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]. Abroad, Garibaldi symbolized the ''Risorgimento'' Italy of those dramatic years and the intrepid audacity that contributed so much to the formation of the Italian nation ... A professional liberator, he fought for the oppressed people wherever he found them. Despite having the temperament of the fighter and the man of action, he managed to be an idealist distinctly distinct from his colder-minded contemporaries. Everything he did, he did it with passionate conviction and unlimited enthusiasm; a career full of color and unexpected shows us one of the most romantic products of the time. Moreover, he was a lovable and charming person, of transparent honesty, who was obeyed without hesitation and for whom he died happy.\"<ref>[https://le-citazioni.it/frasi/194757-denis-mack-smith-allapice-della-gloria-giuseppe-garibaldi-era-for/]</ref><ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Garibaldi'', Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1993</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Cannadine]]:\n\n{{quote|It depicted Garibaldi as a [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylean]] hero\u2014poet, patriot, and man of action\u2014whose inspired leadership created the Italian nation. For Trevelyan, Garibaldi was the champion of freedom, progress, and tolerance, who vanquished the despotism, reaction, and obscurantism of the Austrian empire and the Neapolitan monarchy. The books were also notable for their vivid evocation of landscape (Trevelyan had himself followed the course of Garibaldi's marches), for their innovative use of documentary and oral sources, and for their spirited accounts of battles and military campaigns.<ref>David Cannadine, \"Trevelyan, George Macaulay (1876\u20131962)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,''  2004; online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36554, accessed 5 Nov 2017]</ref>}}\n\nGaribaldi, along with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other Europeans, supported the creation of a European federation. Many Europeans expected that the 1871 [[German Unification|unification of Germany]] would make Germany a European and world leader that would champion humanitarian policies. This idea is apparent in the following letter Giuseppe Garibaldi sent to [[Karl Blind]] on 10 April 1865:\n\n{{quote|The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation which possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples, but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed. We need the kind of leadership which, in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life, and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression.\n\nThis role of world leadership, left vacant as things are today, might well be occupied by the German nation. You Germans, with your grave and philosophic character, might well be the ones who could win the confidence of others and guarantee the future stability of the international community. Let us hope, then, that you can use your energy to overcome your moth-eaten [[thirty tyrants]] of the various German states. Let us hope that in the center of Europe you can then make a unified nation out of your fifty millions.

After participating in an uprising in Piedmont, he was sentenced to death, but escaped by sailing to South America; he spent 14 years in exile, taking part in several wars and learning the art of guerrilla warfare.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Garibaldi'' (2001)</ref>\nIn 1835, in Brazil, he took up the cause of the [[Riograndense Republic]] in its attempt to proclaim another republic within Santa Catarina, joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins. Garibaldi also became involved in the [[Uruguayan Civil War]], raising an Italian force known as [[Redshirts (Italy)| Redshirts]], and is still celebrated as an important contributor to Uruguayan independence.\n\nIn 1848, Garibaldi returned to Italy and commanded and fought in military campaigns that eventually led to Italian unification. The provisional government of [[Milan]] made him a general, and in 1849, the Minister of War promoted him to General of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]]. When the [[Second Italian War of Independence|war of independence]] broke out in April 1859, he led his ''[[Hunters of the Alps]]'' in the capture of [[Battle of Varese|Varese]] and [[Battle of San Fermo|Como]] and reached the frontier of South Tyrol; the war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy. The following year, he led the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on behalf of and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II. The expedition was a success and concluded with the annexation of Sicily, Southern Italy, Marche and Umbria to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], before the creation of a unified Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. His last military campaign took place during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as commander of the [[Army of the Vosges]].\n\nGaribaldi became an international figurehead for national independence and republican ideals.

He participated actively in the [[Nizzardo Italians]] community and was certified in 1832 as a merchant navy captain.\n\nIn April 1833, he travelled to [[Taganrog]], Russia, in the schooner ''Clorinda'' with a shipment of oranges. During ten days in port, he met Giovanni Battista Cuneo from [[Oneglia]], a politically active immigrant and member of the secret [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] movement of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. Mazzini was a passionate proponent of Italian unification as a liberal republic through political and social reform. Garibaldi joined the society and took an oath dedicating himself to the struggle to liberate and unify his homeland from Austrian dominance.\n\nIn [[Geneva]] during November 1833, Garibaldi met Mazzini, starting a long relationship that later became troubled. He joined the [[Carbonari]] revolutionary association, and in February 1834 participated in a failed Mazzinian insurrection in [[Piedmont]]. A Genoese court sentenced Garibaldi to death ''in absentia'', and he fled across the border to [[Marseille]].{{-}}\n\n=== South America ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:The Battle of Sant'Antonio, Uruguay in which Garibaldi participated, in 1846.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi during the battle of Sant'Antonio, 1846]]\n[[File:Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War..jpg|thumb|Garibaldi and his men carrying boats from Los Patos lagoon to Tramandahy lake during the Rio Grande do Sul War]]\nGaribaldi first sailed to the [[Beylik of Tunis]] before eventually finding his way to the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Once there, he took up the cause of the [[Riograndense Republic]] in its attempt to separate from Brazil, joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins in the [[Ragamuffin War]] of 1835.\n\nDuring this war he met [[Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro da Silva]], commonly known as Anita. When the Ragamuffins tried to proclaim another republic in the Brazilian province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in October 1839, she joined him aboard his ship, ''Rio Pardo'', and fought alongside him at the battles of Imbituba and Laguna.\n\nIn 1841 Garibaldi and Anita moved to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where Garibaldi worked as a trader and schoolmaster. The couple married in Montevideo the following year. They had four children; [[Menotti Garibaldi|Domenico Menotti]] (1840\u20131903), Rosa (1843\u20131945), Teresa Teresita (1845\u20131903), and [[Ricciotti Garibaldi|Ricciotti]] (1847\u20131924).<ref name=Kleis>{{cite magazine|last = Kleis|first = S.

Around this time he adopted his trademark clothing\u2014the red shirt, [[poncho]], and [[sombrero]] commonly worn by gauchos. \n\nIn 1842 Garibaldi took command of the Uruguayan fleet and raised an [[Italian Legion]] of soldiers\u2014known as [[Redshirts (Italy)| Redshirts]]\u2014for the [[Uruguayan Civil War]]. He aligned his forces with the Uruguayan [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)| Colorados]] led by [[Fructuoso Rivera]], who were aligned with the Argentine [[Unitarian Party]]. This faction received some support from the French and British Empires in their struggle against the forces of former Uruguayan president [[Manuel Oribe]]'s [[National Party (Uruguay)| Blancos]], which was also aligned with Argentine [[Federales (Argentina)|Federales]] under the rule of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] caudillo [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].\n\nThe Italian Legion adopted a black flag that represented Italy in mourning, with a volcano at the center that symbolized the dormant power in their homeland. Though contemporary sources do not mention the Redshirts, popular history asserts that the legion first wore them in Uruguay, getting them from a factory in Montevideo that had intended to export them to the slaughterhouses of Argentina.{{cn|date=May 2019}} These shirts became the symbol of Garibaldi and his followers.\n\nBetween 1842 and 1848, Garibaldi [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|defended Montevideo]] against forces led by Oribe. In 1845 he managed to occupy [[Colonia del Sacramento]] and [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], and led the controversial sack of [[Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos|Gualeguaych\u00fa]] during the [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Adopting guerrilla tactics, Garibaldi later achieved two victories during 1846, in the Battle of Cerro and the Battle of San Antonio del Santo.\n\n=== Induction to Freemasonry ===\nGaribaldi joined Freemasonry during his exile, taking advantage of the asylum the lodges offered to political refugees from European countries governed by despotic regimes. At the age of thirty-seven, during 1844, Garibaldi was initiated in the L'Asil de la Vertud Lodge of Montevideo. This was an irregular lodge under a Brazilian Freemasonry not recognized by the main international masonic obediences, such as the United Grand Lodge of England or the [[Grand Orient de France]].\n\nWhile Garibaldi had little use for Masonic rituals, he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and regarded Freemasonry as a network that united progressive men as brothers both within nations and as a global community. Garibaldi was eventually elected as the Grand Master of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi \u2013 the mason\">[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html Garibaldi \u2013 the mason] Translated from Giuseppe Garibaldi Massone by the Grand Orient of Italy</ref><ref name=\"freemasonry.bcy.ca\">http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/garibaldi_g/garibaldi.html\n\"Garibaldi \u2014 the mason\". Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. & A. M., 2003.</ref>\n\nGaribaldi later regularized his position in 1844, joining the lodge Les Amis de la Patrie of Montevideo under the Grand Orient of France.\n\n==== Election of Pope Pius IX, 1846 ====\nThe fate of his homeland, however, continued to concern Garibaldi. The election of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1846 caused a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile. Pius's initial reforms seemed to identify him as the liberal pope called for by [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], who went on to lead the unification of Italy. When news of these reforms reached Montevideo, Garibaldi wrote to the Pope: {{quote|If these hands, used to fighting, would be acceptable to His Holiness, we most thankfully dedicate them to the service of him who deserves so well of the Church and of the fatherland. Joyful indeed shall we and our companions in whose name we speak be, if we may be allowed to shed our blood in defence of Pius IX's work of redemption.<ref>A. Werner, ''Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi'', Vol. III, Howard Fertig, New York (1971) p. 68.</ref>}}\n\nMazzini, from exile, also applauded the early reforms of Pius IX. In 1847, Garibaldi offered the [[apostolic nuncio]] at Rio de Janeiro, Bedini, the service of his Italian Legion for the liberation of the peninsula. Then news of an outbreak of revolution in [[Palermo]] in January 1848 and revolutionary agitation elsewhere in Italy encouraged Garibaldi to lead around sixty members of his legion home.\n\n=== Return to Italy ===\n[[File:Garibaldi divise.jpg|thumb|left|Popular print showing Garibaldi wearing uniforms of 1848, 1859 and 1860 wars.]]\nGaribaldi returned to Italy amidst the turmoil of the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]] and offered his services to [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]]. The monarch displayed some liberal inclinations but treated Garibaldi with coolness and distrust. Rebuffed by the Piedmontese, he and his followers crossed into Lombardy where they offered assistance to the provisional government of Milan, which had rebelled against the Austrian occupation. In the course of the following unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence]], Garibaldi led his legion to two minor victories at [[Luino]] and [[Morazzone]].\n\nAfter the crushing Piedmontese defeat at the [[battle of Novara (1849)|battle of Novara]] on 23 March 1849, Garibaldi moved to Rome to support the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] recently proclaimed in the [[Papal States]]. However, a French force sent by [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] threatened to topple it. At Mazzini's urging, Garibaldi took command of the defence of Rome. In fighting near [[Velletri]], [[Achille Cantoni]] saved his life. After Cantoni's death, during the [[battle of Mentana]], Garibaldi wrote the novel ''Cantoni the Volunteer''.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi assedio di Roma.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Garibaldi during the siege of Rome]]\nOn 30 April 1849, the Republican army, under Garibaldi's command, defeated a numerically far superior French army. Subsequently, French reinforcements arrived, and the [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]] began on 1 June. Despite the resistance of the Republican army, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: surrender, continue fighting in the streets, or retreat from Rome to continue resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi, having entered the chamber covered in blood, made a speech favouring the third option, ending with: ''Ovunque noi saremo, sar\u00e0 Roma.''<ref>Hibbert, G. C (1965). ''Garibaldi and his enemies''.

The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the [[Holy See]]'s temporal power. Garibaldi and his forces, hunted by Austrian, French, Spanish, and Neapolitan troops, fled to the north, intending to reach Venice, where the [[repubblica di San Marco|Venetians were still resisting]] the Austrian siege. After an epic march, Garibaldi took temporary refuge in [[San Marino]], with only 250 men having not abandoned him. Anita, who was carrying their fifth child, died near [[Comacchio]] during the retreat.\n\n====North America and the Pacific====\n\nGaribaldi eventually managed to reach [[Porto Venere]], near [[La Spezia]], but the Piedmontese government forced him to emigrate again. He went to [[Tangier]], where he stayed with Francesco Carpanetto, a wealthy Italian merchant. Carpanetto suggested that he and some of his associates finance the purchase of a merchant ship, which Garibaldi would command. Garibaldi agreed, feeling that his political goals were, for the moment, unreachable, and he could at least earn a living.<ref name=\"Autobio\">{{cite book|first=Giuseppe|last=Garibaldi|title=Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi|url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographygi02garigoog|publisher=Walter Smith and Innes|year=1889|pages=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographygi02garigoog/page/n66 54]\u201369}}</ref>\n[[File:Poncho e camicia rossa di Garibaldi - Museo del Risorgimento di Milano.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Garibaldi's poncho and red shirt at the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)|Museum of the Risorgimento]], [[Milan]].]]\nThe ship was to be purchased in the United States, so Garibaldi went to New York, arriving on 30 July 1850. However, the funds for buying a ship were lacking. While in New York, he stayed with various Italian friends, including some exiled revolutionaries. He attended the Masonic lodges of New York in 1850, where he met several supporters of democratic internationalism, whose minds were open to socialist thought, and to giving Freemasonry a strong anti-papal stance.<ref name=\"freemasonry.bcy.ca\"/>\n\nThe inventor [[Antonio Meucci]] employed Garibaldi in his candle factory on [[Staten Island]].<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\">{{cite book|first=Kenneth T.|last=Jackson|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300055368|url-access=registration|publisher=The New York Historical Society and Yale University Press|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300055368/page/451 451]}}</ref> (The cottage on Staten Island where he stayed is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is preserved as the [[Garibaldi Memorial]].) Garibaldi was not satisfied with this, and in April 1851 he left New York with his friend Carpanetto for Central America, where Carpanetto was establishing business operations. They first went to Nicaragua, and then to other parts of the region. Garibaldi accompanied Carpanetto as a companion, not a business partner, and used the name ''Giuseppe Pane''.<ref name=\"Autobio\"/>\n\nCarpanetto went on to [[Lima]], Peru, where a shipload of his goods was due, arriving late in 1851 with Garibaldi. En route, Garibaldi called on revolutionary heroine [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]]. At Lima, Garibaldi was generally welcomed. A local Italian merchant, Pietro Denegri, gave him command of his ship ''Carmen'' for a trading voyage across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Garibaldi took the ''Carmen'' to the [[Chincha Islands]] for a load of [[guano]].

Using an inheritance from the death of his brother, he bought half of the Italian island of [[Caprera]] (north of [[Sardinia]]), devoting himself to agriculture. In 1859, the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] (also known as the Austro-Sardinian War) broke out in the midst of internal plots at the Sardinian government. Garibaldi was appointed [[major general]] and formed a volunteer unit named the [[Hunters of the Alps]] (''Cacciatori delle Alpi''). Thenceforth, Garibaldi abandoned Mazzini's republican ideal of the liberation of Italy, assuming that only the Piedmontese monarchy could effectively achieve it. He and his volunteers won victories over the Austrians at [[Battle of Varese|Varese]], [[Battle of San Fermo|Como]], and other places.\n\nGaribaldi was, however, very displeased, as his home city of Nice (''Nizza'' in Italian) had surrendered to the French in return for crucial military assistance. In April 1860, as deputy for Nice in the Piedmontese parliament at Turin, he vehemently attacked Cavour for ceding Nice and the [[County of Nice]] (''Nizzardo'') to Louis Napoleon, Emperor of France. In the following years, Garibaldi (with other passionate ''[[Nizzardo Italians]]'') promoted the ''[[Italian irredentism]]'' of his ''Nizza'', even with riots (in 1872).\n\n===Campaign of 1860===\n{{see also|Expedition of the Thousand}}\n[[File:Garibaldi departing on the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860.jpg|left|thumb|Garibaldi departing on the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860]]\nOn 24 January 1860, Garibaldi married 18-year-old Giuseppina Raimondi. Immediately after the wedding ceremony, she informed him that she was pregnant with another man's child and Garibaldi left her the same day.<ref>Hibbert, Christopher. Garibaldi and His Enemies. New York: Penguin Books, 1987. p. 171.</ref> At the beginning of April 1860, uprisings in [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] and [[Palermo]] in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] provided Garibaldi with an opportunity. He gathered about a thousand volunteers \u2013 called ''i Mille'' (the Thousand), or, as popularly known, the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]]&nbsp;\u2013 in two ships named ''Il Piemonte'' and ''Il Lombardo'', and left from [[Genoa]] on 5 May in the evening and landed at [[Marsala]], on the westernmost point of Sicily, on 11 May.\n\n[[File:Battle of Calatafimi.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Calatafimi]]]]\nSwelling the ranks of his army with scattered bands of local rebels, Garibaldi led 800 volunteers to victory over an enemy force of 1500 on the hill of [[Calatafimi-Segesta|Calatafimi]] on 15 May. He used the counter-intuitive tactic of an uphill bayonet charge. He saw that the hill was terraced, and the terraces would shelter his advancing men. Though small by comparison with the coming clashes at Palermo, Milazzo, and Volturno, this battle was decisive in establishing Garibaldi's power in the island. An apocryphal but realistic story had him say to his lieutenant [[Nino Bixio]], \"Here we either make Italy, or we die.\"{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}} In reality, the Neapolitan forces were ill-guided, and most of its higher officers had been bought out.\n\nThe next day, he declared himself [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi|dictator of Sicily]] in the name of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]].  He advanced to the outskirts of Palermo, the capital of the island, and launched a siege on 27 May. He had the support of many inhabitants, who rose up against the garrison\u2014but before they could take the city, reinforcements arrived and bombarded the city nearly to ruins. At this time, a British admiral intervened and facilitated a truce, by which the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Neapolitan]] royal troops and warships surrendered the city and departed. The young Henry Adams -- later to become a distinguished American writer -- visited the city in June and described the situation, along with his meeting with Garibaldi, in a long and vivid letter to his older brother Charles.<ref>J.C. Levenson et al., ''The Letters of Henry Adams, vol. 1:  1858-1868'' (1982) pp. 162-172.</ref> Historians Clough et al. argue that Garibaldi's Thousand were students, independent artisans, and professionals, not peasants. The support given by Sicilian peasants was not out of a sense of patriotism but from their hatred of exploitative landlords and oppressive Neapolitan officials.

He gained worldwide renown and the adulation of Italians. Faith in his prowess was so strong that doubt, confusion, and dismay seized even the Neapolitan court. Six weeks later, he marched against Messina in the east of the island, winning a ferocious and difficult battle at Milazzo. By the end of July, only the citadel resisted.\n\n[[File:REALISM MURAL 19TH.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II on the bridge of Teano on 26 October 1860]]\nHaving conquered Sicily, he crossed the [[Strait of Messina]] and marched north. Garibaldi's progress was met with more celebration than resistance, and on 7&nbsp;September he entered the capital city of [[Naples]], by train. Despite taking Naples, however, he had not to this point defeated the Neapolitan army. Garibaldi's volunteer army of 24,000 was not able to defeat conclusively the reorganized Neapolitan army\u2014about 25,000&nbsp;men\u2014on 30 September at the [[Battle of Volturnus (1860)|battle of Volturno]]. This was the largest battle he ever fought, but its outcome was effectively decided by the arrival of the Piedmontese Army.\n\nFollowing this, Garibaldi's plans to march on to Rome were jeopardized by the Piedmontese, technically his ally but unwilling to risk war with France, whose army protected the Pope. The Piedmontese themselves had conquered most of the Pope's territories in their march south to meet Garibaldi, but they had deliberately avoided Rome, capital of the Papal state. Garibaldi chose to hand over all his territorial gains in the south to the Piedmontese and withdrew to Caprera and temporary retirement. Some modern historians consider the handover of his gains to the Piedmontese as a political defeat, but he seemed willing to see Italian unity brought about under the Piedmontese crown. The meeting at [[Teano]] between Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II is the most important event in modern Italian history but is so shrouded in controversy that even the exact site where it took place is in doubt.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi on Caprera....jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Garibaldi on [[Caprera]] island, Sardinia]]\nGaribaldi deeply disliked the Sardinian Prime Minister, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]. To an extent, he simply mistrusted Cavour's pragmatism and ''[[realpolitik]]'', but he also bore a personal grudge for Cavour's trading away his home city of Nice to the French the previous year. On the other hand, he felt attracted toward the Piedmontese monarch, who in his opinion had been chosen by Providence for the liberation of Italy. In his famous meeting with [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at [[Teano]] on 26 October 1860, Garibaldi greeted him as [[King of Italy]] and shook his hand. Garibaldi rode into Naples at the king's side on 7 November, then retired to the rocky island of [[Caprera]], refusing to accept any reward for his services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] (in 1861), he was a very popular figure. The [[39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was named ''Garibaldi Guard'' after him.<ref name=\"Garibaldi Guard\">http://www.civilwarhome.com/italian.htm Civil War Home] \u2013 The Civil War Society's \"Encyclopedia of the Civil War\" \u2013 Italian-Americans in the Civil War.</ref> Garibaldi himself volunteered his services to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Garibaldi was offered a major general's commission in the U. S. Army through the letter from Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] to H. S. Sanford, the U. S. Minister at Brussels, July 17, 1861.<ref>Mack Smith, pp. 69\u201370.</ref> On September 18, 1861, Sanford sent the following reply to Seward:\n\n{{quote|<nowiki>[Garibaldi]</nowiki> said that the only way in which he could render service, as he ardently desired to do, to the cause of the United States, was as Commander-in-chief of its forces, that he would only go as such, and with the additional contingent power\u2014to be governed by events\u2014of declaring the abolition of slavery; that he would be of little use without the first, and without the second it would appear like a civil war in which the world at large could have little interest or sympathy.<ref>Mack Smith, p. 70.</ref>}}\n\nThese conditions could not be met. On August 6, 1863, after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] had been issued, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln, \"Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure\".<ref>Mack Smith, p. 72.</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1861, Garibaldi set up the [[International Legion]] bringing together different national divisions of French, Poles, Swiss, German and other nationalities, with a view not just of finishing the liberation of Italy, but also of their homelands. With the motto \"Free from the [[Alps]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]],\"{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}} the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. Mazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchial government, and continued to agitate for a republic. Garibaldi, frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, organized a new venture. This time, he intended to take on the Papal States.\n\n=== Expedition against Rome ===\n[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas)]]\n[[File:Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Garibaldi after being wounded on the Aspromonte Massif]]\nGaribaldi himself was intensely anti-Catholic and anti-papal. His efforts to overthrow the pope by military action mobilized anti-Catholic support. For example, there were major anti-Catholic riots in his name across Britain in 1862, with the Irish Catholics fighting in defense of their Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald M.

Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Rome and the Pope's seat there, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions. Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed he had the secret support of his government.\n\nIn June 1862, he sailed from Genoa to Palermo to gather volunteers for the impending campaign, under the slogan ''Roma o Morte'' (Rome or Death). An enthusiastic party quickly joined him, and he turned for Messina, hoping to cross to the mainland there. He arrived with a force of around two thousand, but the garrison proved loyal to the king's instructions and barred his passage. They turned south and set sail from [[Catania]], where Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at [[Melito di Porto Salvo|Melito]] on 14 August, and marched at once into the [[Calabria]]n mountains.\n\n[[File:Garibaldi \u00e0 Londres 1864.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi is welcomed by cheering crowds as he arrives in London, England.]]\nFar from supporting this endeavor, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General [[Enrico Cialdini]] dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Emilio Pallavicini, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August, the [[Battle of Aspromonte|two forces met]] in the rugged [[Aspromonte]]. One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, killing a few of the volunteers. The fighting ended quickly, as Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Many of the volunteers were taken prisoner, including Garibaldi, who had been wounded by a shot in the foot. The episode was the origin of a famous Italian [[nursery rhyme]]: ''Garibaldi fu ferito'' (\"Garibaldi was wounded\").\n\nA government steamer took him to a prison at [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]] near [[La Spezia]], where he was held in a sort of honorable imprisonment and underwent a tedious and painful operation to heal his wound. His venture had failed, but he was consoled by Europe's sympathy and continued interest. One historian of the [[American Civil War]] wrote that the distraction created by Garibaldi's wounding, followed by his unequivocal endorsement of the Union cause, was as important as Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in preserving British and French neutrality in the American conflict\u2014thus significantly aiding the Northern cause.<ref>Don H.

The [[Austro-Prussian War]] had broken out, and Italy had allied with [[Prussia]] against the [[Austrian Empire]] in the hope of taking [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] from Austrian rule ([[Third Italian War of Independence]]). Garibaldi gathered again his Hunters of the Alps, now some 40,000 strong, and [[Invasion of Trentino (1866)|led them]] into the [[Trentino]]. He defeated the Austrians at [[battle of Bezzecca|Bezzecca]], and made for [[Trento]].\n\n[[File:Garibaldi at Mentana, 3rd November 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Garibaldi at Mentana, 3 November 1867]]\n\nThe Italian regular forces were defeated at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] on the sea, and made little progress on land after the disaster of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]]. The sides signed an armistice by which Austria ceded Venetia to Italy, but this result was largely due to Prussia's successes on the northern front. Garibaldi's advance through Trentino was for nought, and he was ordered to stop his advance to Trento. Garibaldi answered with a short telegram from the main square of Bezzecca with the famous motto: ''Obbedisco!'' (\"I obey!\").{{uncited quote|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the war, Garibaldi led a political party that agitated for the capture of Rome, the peninsula's ancient capital. In 1867, he again marched on the city, but the Papal army, supported by a French auxiliary force, proved a match for his badly armed volunteers. He was shot in the leg in the [[Battle of Mentana]], and had to withdraw from the Papal territory. The Italian government again imprisoned him for some time, after which he returned to Caprera.\n\n[[File:Garibaldi in Dijon.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi at Dijon]]\n\nIn the same year, Garibaldi sought international support for altogether eliminating the papacy. At the 1867 congress for the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] in [[Geneva]] he proposed: \"The papacy, being the most harmful of all secret societies, ought to be abolished.\"<ref>Giuseppe Guerzoni, ''Garibaldi: con documenti editi e inediti'', Florence, 1882, Vol. 11, 485.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in July 1870, Italian public opinion heavily favored the Prussians, and many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence. After the French garrison was recalled from Rome, the Italian Army [[Capture of Rome|captured the Papal States]] without Garibaldi's assistance. Following the wartime collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan]], Garibaldi, undaunted by the recent hostility shown to him by the men of Napoleon III, switched his support to the newly declared [[French Third Republic]]. On 7 September 1870, within three days of the revolution of 4 September in Paris, he wrote to the ''Movimento'' of Genoa, \"Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 602.</ref> Subsequently, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the [[Army of the Vosges]], an army of volunteers.

In a book review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (9 and 16 July 2007) of a Garibaldi biography, Tim Parks cites the English historian, [[A. J. P. Taylor]], as saying, \"Garibaldi is the only wholly admirable figure in modern history.\"<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/09/070709crbo_books_parks?currentPage=all]</ref>{{full short|date=June 2019}} British historian [[Denis Mack Smith]] wrote: \"At the height of glory, Giuseppe Garibaldi was perhaps the most famous person in Italy. His name was much more famous than that of Cavour and Mazzini, and many more people would have heard of him than [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] or [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]. Abroad, Garibaldi symbolized the ''Risorgimento'' Italy of those dramatic years and the intrepid audacity that contributed so much to the formation of the Italian nation ... A professional liberator, he fought for the oppressed people wherever he found them. Despite having the temperament of the fighter and the man of action, he managed to be an idealist distinctly distinct from his colder-minded contemporaries. Everything he did, he did it with passionate conviction and unlimited enthusiasm; a career full of color and unexpected shows us one of the most romantic products of the time. Moreover, he was a lovable and charming person, of transparent honesty, who was obeyed without hesitation and for whom he died happy.\"<ref>[https://le-citazioni.it/frasi/194757-denis-mack-smith-allapice-della-gloria-giuseppe-garibaldi-era-for/]</ref><ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Garibaldi'', Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1993</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Cannadine]]:\n\n{{quote|It depicted Garibaldi as a [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylean]] hero\u2014poet, patriot, and man of action\u2014whose inspired leadership created the Italian nation. For Trevelyan, Garibaldi was the champion of freedom, progress, and tolerance, who vanquished the despotism, reaction, and obscurantism of the Austrian empire and the Neapolitan monarchy. The books were also notable for their vivid evocation of landscape (Trevelyan had himself followed the course of Garibaldi's marches), for their innovative use of documentary and oral sources, and for their spirited accounts of battles and military campaigns.<ref>David Cannadine, \"Trevelyan, George Macaulay (1876\u20131962)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,''  2004; online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36554, accessed 5 Nov 2017]</ref>}}\n\nGaribaldi, along with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other Europeans, supported the creation of a European federation. Many Europeans expected that the 1871 [[German Unification|unification of Germany]] would make Germany a European and world leader that would champion humanitarian policies. This idea is apparent in the following letter Giuseppe Garibaldi sent to [[Karl Blind]] on 10 April 1865:\n\n{{quote|The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation which possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples, but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed. We need the kind of leadership which, in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life, and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression.\n\nThis role of world leadership, left vacant as things are today, might well be occupied by the German nation. You Germans, with your grave and philosophic character, might well be the ones who could win the confidence of others and guarantee the future stability of the international community. Let us hope, then, that you can use your energy to overcome your moth-eaten [[thirty tyrants]] of the various German states. Let us hope that in the center of Europe you can then make a unified nation out of your fifty millions. All the rest of us would eagerly and joyfully follow you.<ref>Denis Mack Smith (Editor), ''Garibaldi (Great Lives Observed)'', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
