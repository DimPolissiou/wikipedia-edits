The song has been noted to have similarities to [[Toni Basil]]'s 1982 single \"[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]\", and [[The Rubinoos]]' 1979 single \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". The songwriters of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" sued Lavigne and Dr. Luke for copyright infringement; the suit was later settled.\n\n\"Girlfriend\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its [[catchiness]]. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at the top spot of the charts in eight countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. It additionally charted in the top ten of most other countries. The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[The Malloys]], sees Lavigne portraying three alter-egos, with all of them fighting over the same guy. In June 2007, the song's official remix, featuring American rapper [[Lil Mama]], was released. Lavigne performed the song a number of times, including at the 2007 [[MuchMusic Video Awards]], the 2007 [[Teen Choice Awards]], and the 2008 [[Juno Awards]].\n\nThe song's success made it a mainstay of pop music in the late 2000s. \"Girlfriend\" was certified multi-platinum in Australia and the United States. It was among the top-selling songs of 2007, with over 7.3 million worldwide sales. In 2008, the song became the most viewed video on YouTube, and was the first video on the site to reach 100 million views. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the song number thirty-five on their list of \"Top 100 Songs of 2007\" list. Several versions of the song were released with the chorus sung in multiple languages. In 2010, the song was named the ninety-fourth most successful song on the Hot 100 in the 2000s decade. [[Allmusic]] highlighted the song as one of the most significant [[punk-pop]] songs of all time.{{r|www.webcitation.org}}\n\n== Background and composition ==\n{{listen\n| filename    = AvrilLavigne-Girlfriend.ogg\n| title       = Avril Lavigne \u2013 \"Girlfriend\"\n| description = A 21-second sample of the song.\n| pos         = left\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Girlfriend\" was written by Lavigne and [[Dr. Luke]], who also produced the song.{{r|booklet}} \"Girlfriend\" is a moderately fast [[pop punk]],{{r|starpulse|digitalspy|rebild}} and [[power pop]]{{r|rebild}} song at 164 beats per minute, performed in the key of [[D major]].

In addition, Avril Lavigne herself posted on MySpace that the Rubinoos' song had a similar title and vocal hook to [[the Ramones]]' \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", released in 1976.\n\nMcBride said he hired a musicologist to compare the songs. According to McBride, the musicologist reported that the songs were totally dissimilar, even a different [[Meter (music)|meter]]. In July 2007, McBride said that Lavigne had no plans to settle the case, but would consider the costs of defending the case against those of settling.{{r|lawsuit}} An undisclosed settlement was reached between Lavigne and the Rubinoos in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne settles 'Girlfriend' lawsuit|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2008/01/09/avril_lavigne_settles_girlfriend_lawsuit.html|website=The Toronto Star|accessdate=12 March 2018|language=en-CA|date=9 January 2008}}</ref> Gangwer and Dunbar released a statement saying that the similarities between the songs were based on \"certain common and widely used lyrics\" and that they \"completely exonerate Lavigne and Gottwald from any wrongdoing of any kind in connection with the claims made by us in our lawsuit.\"{{r|okmagazine}}\n\n== Music video ==\n[[File:Avril Lavigne Girlfriend video screen shots.png|thumb|160px|right|Lavigne as three of her alter-egos in the video for \"Girlfriend\".]]\n\n=== Development ===\nThe music video was directed by [[The Malloys]] and filmed at [http://www.golfnstuff.com/ Golf N' Stuff] in [[Norwalk, California]]. They praised the video for \"sounding different than most female artist at the time and for its very [[punk rock]]-[[pop music|pop]] feel, something she does better than anybody.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecKyqRcsn4A Making the Video: Girlfriend (see reference at min 4:45)</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nIt features two girls: one with glasses and red hair (Lavigne), and one with a rebellious persona and black hair (also Lavigne). The video begins inside a family fun entertainment center where the red-haired girl and her boyfriend are walking together. The black-haired girl sees her and shows her an intimidating disposition, to which the former ignores. As the couple walk away, the black-haired Lavigne begins to sing the song and tries her luck on the red-haired girl's boyfriend. Featured in the video are scenes of black-haired Lavigne fighting over the man with the red-haired Lavigne and trying to outdo her repeatedly. Between the scenes we see Lavigne, now with pink-streaked blonde hair, singing with her band accompanying her at the back. The video also featured this Lavigne and her friends dancing in a restroom.\n\nAfter the starting scene, the video shows them at Li'l Indy, where they ride go-carts. Here, black-haired Lavigne is seen viciously bumping the car of the red-haired Lavigne, causing her to spin around and lose control. Next, the red-haired Lavigne and her boyfriend get inside a photo booth where black-haired Lavigne slips in and grabs the red-haired girl away before they take pictures. Black-haired Lavigne's friends then block the red-haired girl's way (by positioning themselves at the booth entrance) to give her more time.\n\nThe couple are now seen eating together, where black-haired Lavigne sees them yet again, throws the food away and kisses the red-haired girl's boyfriend, much to the latter's surprise and anger. It is nighttime when the couple decide to head over to a [[miniature golf]] course to while away some time playing, where the red-haired girl cheerfully wins.\n\nUnfortunately for her, black-haired Lavigne and her friends happen to be present at the venue as well. As soon as she and her friends see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her in the head with a golf ball, resulting in the red-haired girl splashing down into the water. Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold hands together, but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a [[portable toilet]] ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.\n\nLavigne's boyfriend in the video is played by American model Bryan McMullin and dresses similarly to the \"rocker\" Lavigne in the video. The video features Lavigne's previous guitarist [[Evan Taubenfeld]], and Lavigne's brother Matt on bass.{{r|Youtube Video}}\n\n=== Reception ===\nOn 18 July 2008, \"Girlfriend\" became the most viewed video at that time on [[YouTube]]{{r|wired}} and in August of that year, surpassed 100 million views, becoming the only YouTube video available at that time to reach that milestone (although [[Cansei de Ser Sexy|CSS]]'s  \"[[Music Is My Hot Hot Sex]]\" had reached that milestone a couple months before, it has been removed from the website under accusations that the views had been fraudulent).<ref name=\"History2\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xN13_HFX97NjPei9I4m_MmCvBFCMSTAiJuAAiu_5s08/edit#gid=700564302|title=History of the Most Viewed YouTube Video|work=[[Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms|Google Sheets]] and [[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CSS\">{{cite web|url=https://moz.com/blog/youtubes-new-1-video-the-unprecedented-rise-and-the-mobocracy-that-led-to-its-fall|title=YouTube's New #1 Video: The Unprecedented Rise and the Mobocracy that Led to its Fall|work=Danny Dover|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> The YouTube video of the song was accused of having an exaggerated number of views due to the use of a web link posted by AvrilBandAids, a [[fansite]] devoted to Lavigne.{{r|wired2}} Clicking on the link would automatically reload the YouTube video of \"Girlfriend\" every fifteen seconds. Fans of Lavigne were encouraged to: \"Keep this page open while you browse the internet, study for exams, or even sleep. For extra viewing power, open up two or more browser windows at this page!\"{{r|wired3}} However, the fansite later revealed that no \"cheating\" had taken place, and that the link had merely been a ruse to draw more attention to the video, thereby attracting additional views. It is expected that Lavigne's YouTube video views have earned in excess of US$2,000,000{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. In November 2009, [[RCA Records]] removed the video of the song from YouTube, by which time it had received around 130 million views.{{r|webtv}} A new upload of the music video is now officially hosted on Lavigne's [[Vevo]] channel on YouTube, with over 480 million views as of October 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Avril Lavigne - Girlfriend (Official Music Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nThe song is featured on the soundtrack to the video game ''[[Burnout Dominator]]'' in four different languages which includes Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin and English.{{r|playstation.about.com}} The song is also featured in ''[[Burnout Paradise]]'' which only includes the English Version.{{r|www.computerandvideogames.com}}\n\nThe BBC Chart Show reported a sharp divide in reaction to the video.<ref name=\"ChartShow\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2007/03/avril_lavigne_girlfriend_the_b_1.shtml|title=BBC - Chart Blog: Avril Lavigne - 'Girlfriend' - THE BIG DEBATE|first=Fraser|last=McAlpine|date=|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  A criticism of the video was that it was damaging to Lavigne's claims to integrity by imitating younger girls' fashions and encouraging poaching of boyfriends from other girls.<ref name=\"ChartShow\"/>\n\n=== Dr. Luke Remix ===\n[[Lil Mama]] and Lavigne shot a video for the remix of \"Girlfriend\", which was directed by [[R.

The song has been noted to have similarities to [[Toni Basil]]'s 1982 single \"[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]\", and [[The Rubinoos]]' 1979 single \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". The songwriters of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" sued Lavigne and Dr. Luke for copyright infringement; the suit was later settled.\n\n\"Girlfriend\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its [[catchiness]]. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at the top spot of the charts in eight countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. It additionally charted in the top ten of most other countries. The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[The Malloys]], sees Lavigne portraying three alter-egos, with all of them fighting over the same guy. In June 2007, the song's official remix, featuring American rapper [[Lil Mama]], was released. Lavigne performed the song a number of times, including at the 2007 [[MuchMusic Video Awards]], the 2007 [[Teen Choice Awards]], and the 2008 [[Juno Awards]].\n\nThe song's success made it a mainstay of pop music in the late 2000s. \"Girlfriend\" was certified multi-platinum in Australia and the United States. It was among the top-selling songs of 2007, with over 7.3 million worldwide sales. In 2008, the song became the most viewed video on YouTube, and was the first video on the site to reach 100 million views. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the song number thirty-five on their list of \"Top 100 Songs of 2007\" list. Several versions of the song were released with the chorus sung in multiple languages. In 2010, the song was named the ninety-fourth most successful song on the Hot 100 in the 2000s decade. [[Allmusic]] highlighted the song as one of the most significant [[punk-pop]] songs of all time.{{r|www.webcitation.org}}\n\n== Background and composition ==\n{{listen\n| filename    = AvrilLavigne-Girlfriend.ogg\n| title       = Avril Lavigne \u2013 \"Girlfriend\"\n| description = A 21-second sample of the song.\n| pos         = left\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Girlfriend\" was written by Lavigne and [[Dr. Luke]], who also produced the song.{{r|booklet}} \"Girlfriend\" is a moderately fast [[pop punk]],{{r|starpulse|digitalspy|rebild}} and [[power pop]]{{r|rebild}} song at 164 beats per minute, performed in the key of [[D major]].

In addition, Avril Lavigne herself posted on MySpace that the Rubinoos' song had a similar title and vocal hook to [[the Ramones]]' \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", released in 1976.\n\nMcBride said he hired a musicologist to compare the songs. According to McBride, the musicologist reported that the songs were totally dissimilar, even a different [[Meter (music)|meter]]. In July 2007, McBride said that Lavigne had no plans to settle the case, but would consider the costs of defending the case against those of settling.{{r|lawsuit}} An undisclosed settlement was reached between Lavigne and the Rubinoos in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne settles 'Girlfriend' lawsuit|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2008/01/09/avril_lavigne_settles_girlfriend_lawsuit.html|website=The Toronto Star|accessdate=12 March 2018|language=en-CA|date=9 January 2008}}</ref> Gangwer and Dunbar released a statement saying that the similarities between the songs were based on \"certain common and widely used lyrics\" and that they \"completely exonerate Lavigne and Gottwald from any wrongdoing of any kind in connection with the claims made by us in our lawsuit.\"{{r|okmagazine}}\n\n== Music video ==\n[[File:Avril Lavigne Girlfriend video screen shots.png|thumb|160px|right|Lavigne as three of her alter-egos in the video for \"Girlfriend\".]]\n\n=== Development ===\nThe music video was directed by [[The Malloys]] and filmed at [http://www.golfnstuff.com/ Golf N' Stuff] in [[Norwalk, California]]. They praised the video for \"sounding different than most female artist at the time and for its very [[punk rock]]-[[pop music|pop]] feel, something she does better than anybody.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecKyqRcsn4A Making the Video: Girlfriend (see reference at min 4:45)</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nIt features two girls: one with glasses and red hair (Lavigne), and one with a rebellious persona and black hair (also Lavigne). The video begins inside a family fun entertainment center where the red-haired girl and her boyfriend are walking together. The black-haired girl sees her and shows her an intimidating disposition, to which the former ignores. As the couple walk away, the black-haired Lavigne begins to sing the song and tries her luck on the red-haired girl's boyfriend. Featured in the video are scenes of black-haired Lavigne fighting over the man with the red-haired Lavigne and trying to outdo her repeatedly. Between the scenes we see Lavigne, now with pink-streaked blonde hair, singing with her band accompanying her at the back. The video also featured this Lavigne and her friends dancing in a restroom.\n\nAfter the starting scene, the video shows them at Li'l Indy, where they ride go-carts. Here, black-haired Lavigne is seen viciously bumping the car of the red-haired Lavigne, causing her to spin around and lose control. Next, the red-haired Lavigne and her boyfriend get inside a photo booth where black-haired Lavigne slips in and grabs the red-haired girl away before they take pictures. Black-haired Lavigne's friends then block the red-haired girl's way (by positioning themselves at the booth entrance) to give her more time.\n\nThe couple are now seen eating together, where black-haired Lavigne sees them yet again, throws the food away and kisses the red-haired girl's boyfriend, much to the latter's surprise and anger. It is nighttime when the couple decide to head over to a [[miniature golf]] course to while away some time playing, where the red-haired girl cheerfully wins.\n\nUnfortunately for her, black-haired Lavigne and her friends happen to be present at the venue as well. As soon as she and her friends see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her in the head with a golf ball, resulting in the red-haired girl splashing down into the water. Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold hands together, but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a [[portable toilet]] ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.\n\nLavigne's boyfriend in the video is played by American model Bryan McMullin and dresses similarly to the \"rocker\" Lavigne in the video. The video features Lavigne's previous guitarist [[Evan Taubenfeld]], and Lavigne's brother Matt on bass.{{r|Youtube Video}}\n\n=== Reception ===\nOn 18 July 2008, \"Girlfriend\" became the most viewed video at that time on [[YouTube]]{{r|wired}} and in August of that year, surpassed 100 million views, becoming the only YouTube video available at that time to reach that milestone (although [[Cansei de Ser Sexy|CSS]]'s  \"[[Music Is My Hot Hot Sex]]\" had reached that milestone a couple months before, it has been removed from the website under accusations that the views had been fraudulent).<ref name=\"History2\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xN13_HFX97NjPei9I4m_MmCvBFCMSTAiJuAAiu_5s08/edit#gid=700564302|title=History of the Most Viewed YouTube Video|work=[[Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms|Google Sheets]] and [[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CSS\">{{cite web|url=https://moz.com/blog/youtubes-new-1-video-the-unprecedented-rise-and-the-mobocracy-that-led-to-its-fall|title=YouTube's New #1 Video: The Unprecedented Rise and the Mobocracy that Led to its Fall|work=Danny Dover|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> The YouTube video of the song was accused of having an exaggerated number of views due to the use of a web link posted by AvrilBandAids, a [[fansite]] devoted to Lavigne.{{r|wired2}} Clicking on the link would automatically reload the YouTube video of \"Girlfriend\" every fifteen seconds. Fans of Lavigne were encouraged to: \"Keep this page open while you browse the internet, study for exams, or even sleep. For extra viewing power, open up two or more browser windows at this page!\"{{r|wired3}} However, the fansite later revealed that no \"cheating\" had taken place, and that the link had merely been a ruse to draw more attention to the video, thereby attracting additional views. It is expected that Lavigne's YouTube video views have earned in excess of US$2,000,000{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. In November 2009, [[RCA Records]] removed the video of the song from YouTube, by which time it had received around 130 million views.{{r|webtv}} A new upload of the music video is now officially hosted on Lavigne's [[Vevo]] channel on YouTube, with over 480 million views as of October 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Avril Lavigne - Girlfriend (Official Music Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nThe song is featured on the soundtrack to the video game ''[[Burnout Dominator]]'' in four different languages which includes Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin and English.{{r|playstation.about.com}} The song is also featured in ''[[Burnout Paradise]]'' which only includes the English Version.{{r|www.computerandvideogames.com}}\n\nThe BBC Chart Show reported a sharp divide in reaction to the video.<ref name=\"ChartShow\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2007/03/avril_lavigne_girlfriend_the_b_1.shtml|title=BBC - Chart Blog: Avril Lavigne - 'Girlfriend' - THE BIG DEBATE|first=Fraser|last=McAlpine|date=|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  A criticism of the video was that it was damaging to Lavigne's claims to integrity by imitating younger girls' fashions and encouraging poaching of boyfriends from other girls.<ref name=\"ChartShow\"/>\n\n=== Dr. Luke Remix ===\n[[Lil Mama]] and Lavigne shot a video for the remix of \"Girlfriend\", which was directed by [[R.

[[Filipe Morais]] took the corner kick and passed it to [[Andrew Davies (footballer)|Andrew Davies]] who headed it towards the goal. However, Czech goalkeeper, [[Petr \u010cech]], blocked the shot, and Chelsea's defenders successfully cleared it. Six minutes later, [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] attempted to pass the ball to [[C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta]] so that he could score, but Bradford City captain, [[Stephen Darby]], intercepted the ball and kicked it out of play. Oscar took the corner kick and kicked it towards the box, but Darby headed the ball back in the same direction. Oscar took another corner kick and kicked it towards the goal again. This time though, Cahill [[Volley (football)|volleyed]] the ball with his left foot and Bradford City conceded the first goal of the game. For the next two minutes, [[Didier Drogba]] would attempt two shots on target, however, both were blocked by goalkeeper, [[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]]. Chelsea dominated possession of the ball from the 23rd minute until the 37th minute, and the two teams spent most of their time during that interval in Bradford City's defensive half. On the 38th minute, Egyptian forward, [[Mohamed Salah]], passed the ball to [[Ramires]] as the Brazilian ran through Bradford City's defenders and scored their last goal of the game. Two minutes later, Bradford City were given a [[free kick]] after [[Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my]] committed a foul. Like always, Filipe Morais took the free kick and kicked it towards Davies, who passed it to [[Jon Stead]]. Stead scored a screamer from the box and gave Bradford City their first goal of the game. The referees added 2 minutes of [[injury time]] to the first half, but nothing happened besides a few missed shots on target and a few free kicks.\n\n=== Second half ===\nFilipe Morais kicked a corner in the 53rd minute, and [[James Hanson (footballer, born 1987)|James Hansen]] tried to head it in, but it was blocked by \u010cech. Following the save by \u010cech, Mourinho came off the sidelines to go to edge of his [[technical area]] so that he could yell instructions to his players after they had committed multiple errors. Near the end of the 53rd minute, [[James Meredith (footballer)|James Meredith]] crossed the ball to the outside of the box, where it found Filipe Morais who missed an attempt and smashed the ball over the crossbar. On the 57th minute, Oscar missed a potential goal from 30 yards out as the ball went out to the right of Bradford's goalpost, but it deflected off Darby, giving Chelsea a free kick. During a corner kick in the 66th minute, Mikel and Knott's heads collided with each other, getting Mikel injured and delaying the game. Mikel was walked off the pitch by Chelsea's medical staff and subbed off for [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]] in the 70th minute. Mourinho also subbed off Mo Salah for [[Willian (footballer, born 1988)|Willian]]. On the 71st minute, Drogba was fouled by Davies when the Englishman's arm blocked the Ivorian's face as they were competing for the ball. The referee awarded Chelsea a free kick because of Davies' foul and Drogba almost headed the ball into the net, but Williams saved it. In the 75th minute, Morais scored an unexpected [[Equaliser (sports)|equaliser]] after Meredith's [[throw-in]] to bring the game level 2\u20132. Immediately after the goal, Mourinho subbed off R\u00e9my for Belgian [[Attacking Midfielder|attacking midfielder]], [[Eden Hazard]], so that Chelsea would have a better chance of scoring a winner. Hazard, Drogba, Willian, and F\u00e0bregas all attempted to score inside the box for the next three minutes, but they had no space to score and Ben Williams caught to ball to reset the game. In the 80th minute, [[Phil Parkinson]] made his first substitution of the game, and subbed off Billy Knott for [[Mark Yeates]]. Two minutes later, Jon Stead assisted [[Andy Halliday]] as he would score the decisive winner which would send Bradford City to the next round. Chelsea had multiple chances to equal the score during the rest of the game: Drogba's missed header in the 83rd minute, [[Kurt Zouma]]'s shot in the 85th minute which flew into the stands, and Willian's missed shot in the 2nd minute of stoppage time. Parkinson made his two last substitutions before stoppage time began, subbing off Halliday for [[Christopher Routis]] in the 87th minute, and subbing off Morais for [[Billy Clarke (footballer, born 1987)|Billy Clarke]] in the 89th minute, after the Portuguese had gotten a [[Pulled hamstring|hamstring injury]]. Despite the fact that Clarke and Darby were each given [[Yellow card (association football)|yellow cards]] during stoppage, Chelsea couldn't score after both fouls or during the 7 minutes of stoppage time. Mark Yeates sealed the deal for Bradford City in the 94th minute by chipping the ball around Petr \u010cech to bring the final score to 2\u20134. The match was slightly delayed before the final whistle as Zouma was carried out of the pitch after an injury.\n\n=== Details ===\n{{Football box\n| date = 24 January 2015\n| event = \n| team1 = [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (1)\n| team2 = [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] (3)\n| time = 15:00\n| round = \n| score1 = 2\n| score2 = 4\n| goals1 = [[Gary Cahill|Cahill]] {{goal|21}}<br>[[Ramires]] {{goal|38}}\n| report = https://www.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/24/england/fa-cup/chelsea-football-club/bradford-city-afc/1982874/?ICID=PL_MS_04\n| goals2 = {{goal|41}} [[Jon Stead|Stead]] <br> {{goal|75}} [[Filipe Morais|Morais]] <br> {{goal|82}} [[Andy Halliday|Halliday]] <br> {{goal|90+4}} [[Mark Yeates|Yeates]]\n| penaltyscore = \n| penalties1 = \n| penalties2 = \n| stadium = [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]\n| location = [[London]]\n| attendance = 41,014\n| referee = [[Andre Marriner]] ([[Birmingham County Football Association|Birmingham]])\n| aet = \n}}\n\n{| width=\"92%\"\n|{{Football kit|align=right|pattern_la=_chelsea1415h|pattern_b=_chelsea1415home|pattern_ra=_chelsea1415h|pattern_sh=_chelsea1415h|pattern_so=_chelsea1415h|leftarm=0000FF|body=0000FF|rightarm=0000FF|shorts=0000FF|socks=FFFFFF|title=Chelsea}}\n|{{Football kit|leftarm=800000|body=800000|rightarm=800000|shorts=000000|socks=000000|title=Bradford City|pattern_b=_goldstripes_thin|pattern_la=_goldstripes|pattern_ra=_goldstripes}}\n|}\n\n{| width=\"92%\"\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n!

[[Filipe Morais]] took the corner kick and passed it to [[Andrew Davies (footballer)|Andrew Davies]] who headed it towards the goal. However, Czech goalkeeper, [[Petr \u010cech]], blocked the shot, and Chelsea's defenders successfully cleared it. Six minutes later, [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] attempted to pass the ball to [[C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta]] so that he could score, but Bradford City captain, [[Stephen Darby]], intercepted the ball and kicked it out of play. Oscar took the corner kick and kicked it towards the box, but Darby headed the ball back in the same direction. Oscar took another corner kick and kicked it towards the goal again. This time though, Cahill [[Volley (football)|volleyed]] the ball with his left foot and Bradford City conceded the first goal of the game. For the next two minutes, [[Didier Drogba]] would attempt two shots on target, however, both were blocked by goalkeeper, [[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]]. Chelsea dominated possession of the ball from the 23rd minute until the 37th minute, and the two teams spent most of their time during that interval in Bradford City's defensive half. On the 38th minute, Egyptian forward, [[Mohamed Salah]], passed the ball to [[Ramires]] as the Brazilian ran through Bradford City's defenders and scored their last goal of the game. Two minutes later, Bradford City were given a [[free kick]] after [[Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my]] committed a foul. Like always, Filipe Morais took the free kick and kicked it towards Davies, who passed it to [[Jon Stead]]. Stead scored a screamer from the box and gave Bradford City their first goal of the game. The referees added 2 minutes of [[injury time]] to the first half, but nothing happened besides a few missed shots on target and a few free kicks.\n\n=== Second half ===\nFilipe Morais kicked a corner in the 53rd minute, and [[James Hanson (footballer, born 1987)|James Hansen]] tried to head it in, but it was blocked by \u010cech. Following the save by \u010cech, Mourinho came off the sidelines to go to edge of his [[technical area]] so that he could yell instructions to his players after they had committed multiple errors. Near the end of the 53rd minute, [[James Meredith (footballer)|James Meredith]] crossed the ball to the outside of the box, where it found Filipe Morais who missed an attempt and smashed the ball over the crossbar. On the 57th minute, Oscar missed a potential goal from 30 yards out as the ball went out to the right of Bradford's goalpost, but it deflected off Darby, giving Chelsea a free kick. During a corner kick in the 66th minute, Mikel and Knott's heads collided with each other, getting Mikel injured and delaying the game. Mikel was walked off the pitch by Chelsea's medical staff and subbed off for [[Cesc F\u00e0bregas]] in the 70th minute. Mourinho also subbed off Mo Salah for [[Willian (footballer, born 1988)|Willian]]. On the 71st minute, Drogba was fouled by Davies when the Englishman's arm blocked the Ivorian's face as they were competing for the ball. The referee awarded Chelsea a free kick because of Davies' foul and Drogba almost headed the ball into the net, but Williams saved it. In the 75th minute, Morais scored an unexpected [[Equaliser (sports)|equaliser]] after Meredith's [[throw-in]] to bring the game level 2\u20132. Immediately after the goal, Mourinho subbed off R\u00e9my for Belgian [[Attacking Midfielder|attacking midfielder]], [[Eden Hazard]], so that Chelsea would have a better chance of scoring a winner. Hazard, Drogba, Willian, and F\u00e0bregas all attempted to score inside the box for the next three minutes, but they had no space to score and Ben Williams caught to ball to reset the game. In the 80th minute, [[Phil Parkinson]] made his first substitution of the game, and subbed off Billy Knott for [[Mark Yeates]]. Two minutes later, Jon Stead assisted [[Andy Halliday]] as he would score the decisive winner which would send Bradford City to the next round. Chelsea had multiple chances to equal the score during the rest of the game: Drogba's missed header in the 83rd minute, [[Kurt Zouma]]'s shot in the 85th minute which flew into the stands, and Willian's missed shot in the 2nd minute of stoppage time. Parkinson made his two last substitutions before stoppage time began, subbing off Halliday for [[Christopher Routis]] in the 87th minute, and subbing off Morais for [[Billy Clarke (footballer, born 1987)|Billy Clarke]] in the 89th minute, after the Portuguese had gotten a [[Pulled hamstring|hamstring injury]]. Despite the fact that Clarke and Darby were each given [[Yellow card (association football)|yellow cards]] during stoppage, Chelsea couldn't score after both fouls or during the 7 minutes of stoppage time. Mark Yeates sealed the deal for Bradford City in the 94th minute by chipping the ball around Petr \u010cech to bring the final score to 2\u20134.

These geological units make up the core of the [[geology]] of the [[High Weald]] in the English counties of [[West Sussex]], [[East Sussex]] and [[Kent]].\n\nThe other component formations of the [[Hastings Beds]] are the underlying [[Ashdown Formation]] and the overlying [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. The [[Hastings Beds]] in turn form part of the [[Wealden Group]] which underlies much of southeast [[England]]. The sediments of the [[Weald]], including the Wadhurst Clay Formation, were deposited during the [[Early Cretaceous]] Period, which lasted for approximately 40 million years from 140 to 100 million years ago. The Wadhurst Clay is of Early to Late [[Valanginian]] age.<ref name=Hopson>Hopson, P.M., Wilkinson, I.P. and Woods, M.A. (2010) ''A stratigraphical framework for the Lower Cretaceous of England''. Research Report RR/08/03. British Geological Survey, Keyworth.</ref> The Formation takes its name from the market town of [[Wadhurst]] in [[East Sussex]].\n\n== Lithology ==\n\n[[File:Top Ashdown Pebble Bed.jpg|thumb|The Top Ashdown Pebble Bed, which marks the base of the Wadhurst Clay in [[East Sussex]]|alt=|left]]\n\nThe Wadhurst Clay comprises predominantly medium to dark bluish grey over-consolidated clays, silts, [[mudstone]]s, and shales. These lithologies often occur with subordinate amounts of pale grey silty mudstones, laminated siltstones, sandstones, conglomerate, shelly limestones and clay-ironstones.<ref name=Lake>Lake, R.D. & Shepard-Thorn, E.R. (1987) ''Geology of the country around Hastings and Dungeness: Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheets 320 and 321''. British Geological Survey, London.</ref> When they become exposed to the elements at the surface, the mudstones often degrade over a short period of time and weather to yellowish brown and greenish grey clays.<ref name=Codd>Codd, J.W. (2007) ''Analysis of the distribution and characteristics of landslips in the Weald of East Sussex''. MSc dissertation, University of Brighton.</ref>\n\nThe formation thickness ranges from 55m in the [[Tenterden]] area, to 30m near [[Lewes]] and varies in between. In [[Kent]], the Wadhurst Clay has been proven to over 70m thick near [[Tunbridge Wells]] <ref name=Lake/> and in [[West Sussex]] up to 80m near [[Horsham]].<ref name=Reeves>Reeves, G.M., Sims, I., & Cripps, J.C. (2006) ''Clay Minerals Used in Construction'', Geological Society, London, Engineering Geology Special Publication, 21, 153-175.</ref>\n\nThe base of the Wadhurst Clay is taken at the bottom of the Top Ashdown Pebble Bed. The base of this marker horizon marks the formational change to the [[Ashdown Formation]]. Despite its name this thin and impressistent bed comprises a coarse grained to gravelly sandstone. This horizon is best exposed at Cliff End, [[East Sussex]], but where it is encountered elsewhere, it is usually fairly distinctive and easily identified. The Top Ashdown Pebble Bed occurs mainly in the southern half of [[East Sussex]] and is often missing elsewhere. Where this is the case, the boundary is taken at a layer of disconnected ripples.<ref name=Shephard-Thorn>Lake, Shepard-Thorn, E.R., Smart, J.G.O., Bisson, G. & Edmonds, E.A. (1966) ''Geology of the country around Tenterden: Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheet 304''. British Geological Survey, London.</ref>\n\nThe top of the Wadhurst Clay is marked by a distinct lithological change into the siltstones of the [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. The uppermost clays of the Wadhurst Clay, closest to the boundary are often stained red.<ref name=Hopson/>\n\n[[File:Landslip.jpg|thumb|Translational landslip at the boundary of the Wadhurst Clay and [[Tunbridge Wells Sand]] near [[Etchingham]]|alt=|right]]\n\n== Engineering Geology ==\n\nNatural slopes in the Wadhurst Clay, like those in the [[Ashdown Formation]], are known for their instability, especially where impermeable clays and impermeable silts and siltstones are interbedded. Instability, resulting in landslips, often occurs along shear surfaces and weaknesses that originally developed during the Late [[Devensian]] [[glaciation]]. Other common features include cambering, valley bulging and solifluction lobes.\n\nLandslips often occur at or close to the upper boundary of the Wadhurst Clay, which is shared with the overlying [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. This is partly caused by the steep sided hill, valley and ravine topography of the [[High Weald]] and partly by the lithological variation between the formations and the presence of spring lines and seepages.<ref name=\"Codd\" />\n\nWhen percolating groundwater in the permeable sandstones of the [[Tunbridge Wells Sands]] comes into contact with the upper impermeable clay beds of the Wadhurst Clay, it is forced to find alternative migration pathways to the surface. This results in the saturation and weakening of the upper portion of the Wadhurst Clay, increasing the chances of failure.<ref name=Codd/>\n\n== Paleobiota==\nTaken from <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displayStrata?geological_group=Wealden&formation=Wadhurst%20Clay&group_formation_member=Wadhurst%20Clay|title=Wadhurst Clay Formation|last=|first=|date=|website=Paleobiology Database|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Dinosaurs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" |'''[[Dinosaur|Dinosaurs]] reported from the Wadhurst Clay'''\n|-\n!Genus\n!Species\n!Location\n!Stratigraphic position\n!Material\n!Notes\n!Images\n|-\n|''[[Barilium]]''\n|''B. dawsoni''<ref name=\"east-sussex2\">\"10.19 East Sussex, England; 1.

These geological units make up the core of the [[geology]] of the [[High Weald]] in the English counties of [[West Sussex]], [[East Sussex]] and [[Kent]].\n\nThe other component formations of the [[Hastings Beds]] are the underlying [[Ashdown Formation]] and the overlying [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. The [[Hastings Beds]] in turn form part of the [[Wealden Group]] which underlies much of southeast [[England]]. The sediments of the [[Weald]], including the Wadhurst Clay Formation, were deposited during the [[Early Cretaceous]] Period, which lasted for approximately 40 million years from 140 to 100 million years ago. The Wadhurst Clay is of Early to Late [[Valanginian]] age.<ref name=Hopson>Hopson, P.M., Wilkinson, I.P. and Woods, M.A. (2010) ''A stratigraphical framework for the Lower Cretaceous of England''. Research Report RR/08/03. British Geological Survey, Keyworth.</ref> The Formation takes its name from the market town of [[Wadhurst]] in [[East Sussex]].\n\n== Lithology ==\n\n[[File:Top Ashdown Pebble Bed.jpg|thumb|The Top Ashdown Pebble Bed, which marks the base of the Wadhurst Clay in [[East Sussex]]|alt=|left]]\n\nThe Wadhurst Clay comprises predominantly medium to dark bluish grey over-consolidated clays, silts, [[mudstone]]s, and shales. These lithologies often occur with subordinate amounts of pale grey silty mudstones, laminated siltstones, sandstones, conglomerate, shelly limestones and clay-ironstones.<ref name=Lake>Lake, R.D. & Shepard-Thorn, E.R. (1987) ''Geology of the country around Hastings and Dungeness: Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheets 320 and 321''. British Geological Survey, London.</ref> When they become exposed to the elements at the surface, the mudstones often degrade over a short period of time and weather to yellowish brown and greenish grey clays.<ref name=Codd>Codd, J.W. (2007) ''Analysis of the distribution and characteristics of landslips in the Weald of East Sussex''. MSc dissertation, University of Brighton.</ref>\n\nThe formation thickness ranges from 55m in the [[Tenterden]] area, to 30m near [[Lewes]] and varies in between. In [[Kent]], the Wadhurst Clay has been proven to over 70m thick near [[Tunbridge Wells]] <ref name=Lake/> and in [[West Sussex]] up to 80m near [[Horsham]].<ref name=Reeves>Reeves, G.M., Sims, I., & Cripps, J.C. (2006) ''Clay Minerals Used in Construction'', Geological Society, London, Engineering Geology Special Publication, 21, 153-175.</ref>\n\nThe base of the Wadhurst Clay is taken at the bottom of the Top Ashdown Pebble Bed. The base of this marker horizon marks the formational change to the [[Ashdown Formation]]. Despite its name this thin and impressistent bed comprises a coarse grained to gravelly sandstone. This horizon is best exposed at Cliff End, [[East Sussex]], but where it is encountered elsewhere, it is usually fairly distinctive and easily identified. The Top Ashdown Pebble Bed occurs mainly in the southern half of [[East Sussex]] and is often missing elsewhere. Where this is the case, the boundary is taken at a layer of disconnected ripples.<ref name=Shephard-Thorn>Lake, Shepard-Thorn, E.R., Smart, J.G.O., Bisson, G. & Edmonds, E.A. (1966) ''Geology of the country around Tenterden: Memoir for 1:50,000 geological sheet 304''. British Geological Survey, London.</ref>\n\nThe top of the Wadhurst Clay is marked by a distinct lithological change into the siltstones of the [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. The uppermost clays of the Wadhurst Clay, closest to the boundary are often stained red.<ref name=Hopson/>\n\n[[File:Landslip.jpg|thumb|Translational landslip at the boundary of the Wadhurst Clay and [[Tunbridge Wells Sand]] near [[Etchingham]]|alt=|right]]\n\n== Engineering Geology ==\n\nNatural slopes in the Wadhurst Clay, like those in the [[Ashdown Formation]], are known for their instability, especially where impermeable clays and impermeable silts and siltstones are interbedded. Instability, resulting in landslips, often occurs along shear surfaces and weaknesses that originally developed during the Late [[Devensian]] [[glaciation]]. Other common features include cambering, valley bulging and solifluction lobes.\n\nLandslips often occur at or close to the upper boundary of the Wadhurst Clay, which is shared with the overlying [[Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation]]. This is partly caused by the steep sided hill, valley and ravine topography of the [[High Weald]] and partly by the lithological variation between the formations and the presence of spring lines and seepages.<ref name=\"Codd\" />\n\nWhen percolating groundwater in the permeable sandstones of the [[Tunbridge Wells Sands]] comes into contact with the upper impermeable clay beds of the Wadhurst Clay, it is forced to find alternative migration pathways to the surface. This results in the saturation and weakening of the upper portion of the Wadhurst Clay, increasing the chances of failure.<ref name=Codd/>\n\n== Paleobiota==\nTaken from <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displayStrata?geological_group=Wealden&formation=Wadhurst%20Clay&group_formation_member=Wadhurst%20Clay|title=Wadhurst Clay Formation|last=|first=|date=|website=Paleobiology Database|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Dinosaurs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" |'''[[Dinosaur|Dinosaurs]] reported from the Wadhurst Clay'''\n|-\n!Genus\n!Species\n!Location\n!Stratigraphic position\n!Material\n!Notes\n!Images\n|-\n|''[[Barilium]]''\n|''B. dawsoni''<ref name=\"east-sussex2\">\"10.19 East Sussex, England; 1.
