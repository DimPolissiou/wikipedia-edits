He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters. This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any others. His slider has evolved throughout his career. In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break. However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider. This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a [[Cut fastball|cutter]], although Verlander has denied this on various occasions. In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders. He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties. His 12\u20136 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count. He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing.  Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball). His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably. The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\nVerlander is known for his unusual ability to \"add\" and \"subtract\" from his fastball velocity at any point in the game, giving him the ability to throw it in the upper 90s even in the late innings of games. Since 2008, Verlander has thrown pitches of over 100+ mph in the 8th inning or later 44 times, 39 more times than [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] who is second on the list.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Foolish Baseball|title=Justin Verlander's Impossible Inning: A Study in Velocity and Spin Rate l Baseball Bits|date=2018-12-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpIs__45t5I|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> This is despite the fact that he has thrown the most pitches in the major leagues since the beginning of the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_lemire/05/02/justin.verlander.velocity/index.html |title=Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander defies conventional wisdom \u2013 Joe Lemire \u2013 SI.com |last=Lemire |first=Joe |date=May 2, 2012 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 6, 2012 }}</ref> After a couple of injury prone seasons, many believed Verlander had lost the velocity most fans had grown accustomed to.

[[pitcher]] for the [[Houston Astros]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He has also played in MLB for the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nFrom [[Manakin-Sabot, Virginia]], Verlander attended [[Old Dominion University]] (ODU) and played [[college baseball]] for the [[Old Dominion Monarchs baseball|Monarchs]]. He broke the Monarchs' and [[Colonial Athletic Association]]'s career records for [[strikeout]]s.  At the [[2003 Pan American Games]], Verlander helped lead the [[United States national baseball team|United States national team]] to a [[silver medal]].\n\nThe Tigers selected Verlander with the second overall pick of the [[2004 Major League Baseball draft|2004 MLB draft]]. He made his major league debut with the Tigers in 2005, and played there for 12 years as the [[Ace (baseball)|ace]] in their starting rotation, as a key figure in four consecutive [[American League Central|American League (AL) Central]] division championships (from 2011 to 2014) and two [[American League Championship Series|AL Pennants]] (in 2006 and 2012). He is among the career pitching leaders for the Tigers, including ranking second in strikeouts (2,373), seventh in [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] (183), and eighth in [[innings pitched]] (2,511). The Tigers traded Verlander to the Astros before the 2017 trade deadline, and he went undefeated in his first five starts heading into the postseason. He was named [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], and was co-winner of the [[Babe Ruth Award]] as the Astros won the [[2017 World Series]]. In 2018, Verlander became the 114th pitcher in major league history to earn 200 career wins, also becoming the 20th-fastest to reach the milestone (412 starts).<ref name=JV-200th>{{cite web |last=McTaggart |first=Brian |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/justin-verlanders-200th-win-has-astros-in-1st/c-291015284 |title=Verlander's 200th win puts Astros alone in first |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=August 19, 2018 |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Verlander became the sixth pitcher in MLB history to throw three career no-hitters<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hascup |first1=Jimmy |title=Astros starter Justin Verlander throws no-hitter against Blue Jays |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/09/01/justin-verlander-no-hitter-blue-jays/2187900001/ |website=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=1 September 2019 }}</ref> and struck out his 3,000th batter, becoming the 18th pitcher in major league history to do so.\n\nVerlander is an eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]], and has led the AL in strikeouts five times, and in [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] twice.

He signed a contract on October 25, 2004. Verlander made his professional debut in 2005. He played for two of Detroit's minor league affiliates: the [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]] (A+) and the [[Erie SeaWolves]] (AA), and also started two games for the Tigers in July.

He also made a start against the [[Minnesota Twins]] 19 days later. Verlander lost both of his major league starts in 2005, but in seven starts with Erie, he was 2\u20130 and his ERA was 0.28. Tightness in his right shoulder caused Verlander's season to end in early August when he was placed on the [[disabled list]]. Verlander was recognized as a [[Florida State League]] all\u2013star, was a starting pitcher in the [[All-Star Futures Game|Futures Game]] and, according to ''[[Baseball America]]'', was Detroit's highest rated prospect.<ref name=\"Information Guide\" />\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n\n====2005\u20132006: MLB debut and AL Rookie of the Year====\nVerlander made his MLB debut on July 4, 2005.

He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters. This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any others. His slider has evolved throughout his career. In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break. However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider. This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a [[Cut fastball|cutter]], although Verlander has denied this on various occasions. In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders. He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties. His 12\u20136 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count. He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing.  Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball). His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably. The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018.\n\nVerlander is known for his unusual ability to \"add\" and \"subtract\" from his fastball velocity at any point in the game, giving him the ability to throw it in the upper 90s even in the late innings of games. Since 2008, Verlander has thrown pitches of over 100+ mph in the 8th inning or later 44 times, 39 more times than [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] who is second on the list.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Foolish Baseball|title=Justin Verlander's Impossible Inning: A Study in Velocity and Spin Rate l Baseball Bits|date=2018-12-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpIs__45t5I|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> This is despite the fact that he has thrown the most pitches in the major leagues since the beginning of the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_lemire/05/02/justin.verlander.velocity/index.html |title=Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander defies conventional wisdom \u2013 Joe Lemire \u2013 SI.com |last=Lemire |first=Joe |date=May 2, 2012 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 6, 2012 }}</ref> After a couple of injury prone seasons, many believed Verlander had lost the velocity most fans had grown accustomed to.

However, structural racism is the most prevalent form of racism because of how it pervades every level of society by incorporating the institutional, historical, cultural, and interpersonal practices within a society that perpetuates racial inequalities therefore evaluating society as a whole.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=Keith |last2=Keleher |first2=Terry |title=Chronic Disparity: Strong and Pervasive Evidence of Racial Inequalities |journal=Poverty Outcomes |pages=24 |date=2004 |url=https://www.intergroupresources.com/rc/Definitions%20of%20Racism.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> The same facts that make structural racism the most prevalent in society make it difficult to analyze and a poor choice when looking at an individual organization because it needs to analyze every level of a society not just a certain organization. The decisive factors for determining if structural racism is active in a society is if there are racial inequalities present in wealth, power, education, healthcare, and opportunities.\n\n== In the United States ==\n[[George M. Fredrickson]] has written that societal racism is deeply embedded in American culture and that in the 18th century, societal racism had already emerged with the purpose of maintaining a white-dominated society,<ref name=Ray>{{cite book|last=Ray|first=George B.|title=Language and Interracial Communication in the U. S.: Speaking in Black and White|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0820462455|page=7}}</ref> and that \"societal racism does not require an ideology to sustain it so long as it was taken for granted\".<ref name=Fredrickson>{{cite book|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|title=The Arrogance of Race: Historical Perspectives on Slavery, Racism and Social Inequality|url=https://archive.org/details/arroganceofraceh00fred|url-access=registration|date=30 June 1988|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0819562173|page=[https://archive.org/details/arroganceofraceh00fred/page/202 202]}}</ref> When looking specifically at structural racism within the United States of America it is the formalization of practices that frequently put whites, or Caucasians, in a position of advantage while at the same time being consistently detrimental to people of color, such as African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Asians, and Middle Easterners. This position of advantage often entails: more opportunities to hold positions of power; privilege, [[white privilege]]; and superior treatment by institutions. This results in racial inequalities between whites and other ethnic groups which often manifest as issues of poverty or health disparities between the groups. Although structural racism often manifests as poverty or [[race and health in the United States|healthcare disparities]] it actually includes the whole structure of [[white supremacy]] that pervades the United States including cultural, political, historical, and socioeconomic parts of society; therefore one can see that structural racism exists within and around every level of society and allows the formalization of structural racism by maintaining it across all levels of a society.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nThe analysis of poverty levels across  different ethnic groups can give an indication of structural racism. To start one must look at the current poverty level in each race group and then the trends over a period a time. The 2017 poverty guideline for the contiguous United States for a household of 3 is $20,460.00 according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<ref>{{cite web |title=2017 Poverty Guidelines |url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/2017-poverty-guidelines |website=ASPE |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=4 December 2018|date=2018-01-12 }}</ref> A household size of three was chosen since the average size in the United States is about three. Using the poverty guideline for a household size of three from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a baseline to compare incomes by household in each ethnic group, one can see the trends and compare the groups. Based on the 2017 U.S. census data and the poverty guideline roughly 13.4% of households who identify as white only make at or below the poverty level and about 20.3% make double or less than double the poverty limit; for those households who identify as black about 26.8% are at or below the poverty line and about 26.9% make double or less than double the poverty limit; for the households who identify as Asian  about 12.6% are at or below the poverty line and about 15.1% make double or less than double the poverty limit; and for the households that identify as Hispanic  about 18.1% are at or below the poverty line and about 26.2% make double or less than double the poverty limit.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |first1= |title=Income and Poverty in the United States:2017 REPORT NUMBER P60-263 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html |website=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> Compared to households who identify as white those who identify as Black or Hispanic have higher rates of poverty. The households who identify as Asian actually have lower rates of poverty whether it is due to higher education here or immigrating already educated and ready to work but one thing is certain this contributes to the [[model minority]] stereotype that comes with, bringing along a whole new set of concepts not always good and causes more distance between Asians and other ethnic groups. Regardless of what the difference is between the Asian households and the others the disparities between the others is clear. A little more than twice the percentage of Black households are impoverished compared to white households and Hispanic households are about five percent more likely to be at or below the poverty line. Both Hispanic and Black households have about a six percent amount of households that make less than or double the poverty line compared to white households. As expected these differences also translate when considering households of each ethnic group that bring in six figures or more. Still based on the 2017 U.S. census data the percentage of households that identify as white alone who have over six figure incomes is 32.9%; only 16.1% of households that identify as Black have six figure incomes; 41.7% of households that identify as Asian have six figure incomes; and the percentage of Hispanic households that have six figure incomes or more is 19.8%.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Once again the same trend emerges here as with the poverty lines. There are disparities between the white households and the Black and Hispanic households. There are more than twice the percentage of Black households with six figure incomes compared to white households;on the other hand Hispanic households have 13% lower amount of households with six figure incomes comparatively. This shows how extensive the wealth gap is between the ethnic groups because they have more impoverished and less wealthy households. The wealth gap between ethnic groups has been present for a while and can be seen over time as median income in the following figure from the U.S. Census website. [[File:2017 Median income graph by ethnicity.png|thumb|2017 median income graph by ethnicity from the U.S. Census Bureau website]] This figure shows that even though as a whole every group got wealthier, the gap between the ethnic groups has stayed relatively the same or slightly grown. This is one of the key concepts of structural racism, there are poverty inequalities that have persisted for decades. Poverty leads to health issues, less higher education, more high school dropouts, more teenage pregnancy, and less opportunities. Therefore, a large part of structural racism has to do with perpetuating a cycle of poverty onto other ethnic groups which makes it substantially harder for them to get to same point or work their way up as a white person in America. This is because the impoverished start with less and because it has been a cycle of poverty most ethnic families do not have property, savings, or valuables to pass on, which just perpetuates the cycle further. These comparisons were not intended to ostracize,exclude, or lump any ethnic groups; there was not current data on Pacific Islander,Native American, or Middle Easterners in the U.S. Census Bureau study that was used.\n\n===Health inequities===\nThe cycle of poverty that structural racism imposes on minorities has adverse effects on their overall health, among other things. [[Health equity|Health inequities]] can manifest as disparities in several aspects of health such as obesity, heart disease, life span, infant mortality, sexual education, exercise, drug use, and cancer. Furthermore, racism itself is thought to have a negative impact on both mental and physical health. According to a paper that analyzed published research, on PubMed from the years 2005-2007, on the connection between discrimination and health there is an inverse relationship between the two; furthermore, the pattern is becoming more apparent across a greater variety of issues and data.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=David R. |last2=Mohammed |first2=Selina A. |title=Discrimination and racial disparities in health: evidence and needed research |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |date=22 November 2008 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201347 |doi=10.1007/s10865-008-9185-0 |pmid=19030981 |pmc=2821669 |issn=1573-3521}}</ref> The fact that a pattern has emerged from the study of this published research data shows that these health inequities are being maintained and reinforced by structural racism. Although this study relies on data from 2005-2007 to support it and show the pattern, this pattern was noticed as far back as 1985 and since then healthcare has come an even longer way. According to the 1985 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in general Americans were getting healthier and had increased longevity but there is a persisting inequality between Blacks and other minority groups in the rate of death and illness contrasting to the overall population; furthermore, the report notes that this inequality has been around for more than a generation at this point or since better, more factual federal records have been kept.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heckler |first1=Margret M. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |title=Executive Summary |journal=Report of the Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health |date=1985 |volume=1 |url=https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/1/ANDERSON.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> This is definitive proof that the federal government noticed these racial inequalities in health long before the 2005-2007 study of research data that revealed a pattern. More importantly it shows structural racism has maintained these health inequalities across decades even though in general Americans have become more healthy and have increased lifespans. Based on the studies they reviewed it became apparent that regardless of socioeconomic status racial inequalities in health were present between minority groups for several health issues such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This shows the health inequities caused by structural racism can be alleviated by increasing socioeconomic status but they still persist at all levels, showing the overarching power and cycle that structural racism submits minorities to. In addition, there is data that supports the fact that as health care has advanced worldwide overall there are more increases in health inequalities between races. One such study that supports this is The Progress Toward the Healthy People 2010 Goals and Objectives which is a review, done by members of the National Center for Health Statistics of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the Center of Excellence on Health Disparities, Morehouse School of Medicine, that explores progress towards improving the overall health quality and longevity of Americans and the health disparities between ethnic groups. To accomplish this they used a system of 31 measures to analyze the progress and disparities; which consisted of 10 leading health indicators (LHI), created by the Department of Health and Human Services, with a few objectives each for twenty two total and the remaining measures were formulated by the group who did the review.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite journal |last1=Sondik |first1=Edward J. |last2=Huang |first2=David T. |last3=Klein |first3=Richard J. |last4=Satcher |first4=David |title=Progress Toward the Healthy People 2010 Goals and Objectives |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |date=21 April 2010 |volume=31 |pages=271\u201381 4 p folliwng 281 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103613 |pmid=20070194 }}</ref> The ten leading health indicators are: Physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, responsible sexual behavior, mental health, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization, and access to healthcare; the group who did the review supplemented the leading health indicators with 7 more objectives and 2 more measures, infant mortality and life expectancy to give 31 in total.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> They used these measures to track the disparities be tween Asians, Hispanic or Latino, Black Non-Hispanics, white non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders; However it is important to note that data is not available for every ethnic group for all 31 measures. However using the available data for the objectives they have more than one time period on they found 6 objectives showed a decrease in disparity between ethnic groups and the national average while they found 18 disparity increases across 11 objectives.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> This confirms that even as healthcare is advancing and new scientific discoveries are being made overall the disparities between ethnic groups are increasing. This is a trend that was noticed in the 1985 report and has continued through the time worsening its effects and contributing to greater health inequalities. Therefore, it can be said that structural racism acts in such a way that it actively hinders the health and longevity of minorities.\n\n=== Relationship to agency ===\n[[Structure and agency]] are opposites.  [[Agency (sociology)|Agency]] is the idea that a person's life outcomes are due entirely, or significantly influenced by their own individual efforts.  [[Social structure]] is the idea that life outcomes are due entirely, or significantly influenced by the individual's race, class, gender, social status, inherited wealth, legal situation, and many other factors that are outside the individual's control.\n\nA society, even a [[race-blind|\"colorblind\"]] society, can be structured in a way that perpetuates racism and [[racial inequality]] even if its individual members do not hold bigoted views about members of other racial groups.  Society can still effectively exclude racially disadvantaged people from decision-making or make choices that have a [[disparate impact]] on them.<ref>Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo.

S.: Speaking in Black and White|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0820462455|page=7}}</ref> and that \"societal racism does not require an ideology to sustain it so long as it was taken for granted\".<ref name=Fredrickson>{{cite book|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|title=The Arrogance of Race: Historical Perspectives on Slavery, Racism and Social Inequality|url=https://archive.org/details/arroganceofraceh00fred|url-access=registration|date=30 June 1988|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0819562173|page=[https://archive.org/details/arroganceofraceh00fred/page/202 202]}}</ref> When looking specifically at structural racism within the United States of America it is the formalization of practices that frequently put whites, or Caucasians, in a position of advantage while at the same time being consistently detrimental to people of color, such as African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Asians, and Middle Easterners. This position of advantage often entails: more opportunities to hold positions of power; privilege, [[white privilege]]; and superior treatment by institutions. This results in racial inequalities between whites and other ethnic groups which often manifest as issues of poverty or health disparities between the groups. Although structural racism often manifests as poverty or [[race and health in the United States|healthcare disparities]] it actually includes the whole structure of [[white supremacy]] that pervades the United States including cultural, political, historical, and socioeconomic parts of society; therefore one can see that structural racism exists within and around every level of society and allows the formalization of structural racism by maintaining it across all levels of a society.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nThe analysis of poverty levels across  different ethnic groups can give an indication of structural racism. To start one must look at the current poverty level in each race group and then the trends over a period a time. The 2017 poverty guideline for the contiguous United States for a household of 3 is $20,460.00 according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<ref>{{cite web |title=2017 Poverty Guidelines |url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/2017-poverty-guidelines |website=ASPE |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=4 December 2018|date=2018-01-12 }}</ref> A household size of three was chosen since the average size in the United States is about three. Using the poverty guideline for a household size of three from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a baseline to compare incomes by household in each ethnic group, one can see the trends and compare the groups. Based on the 2017 U.S. census data and the poverty guideline roughly 13.4% of households who identify as white only make at or below the poverty level and about 20.3% make double or less than double the poverty limit; for those households who identify as black about 26.8% are at or below the poverty line and about 26.9% make double or less than double the poverty limit; for the households who identify as Asian  about 12.6% are at or below the poverty line and about 15.1% make double or less than double the poverty limit; and for the households that identify as Hispanic  about 18.1% are at or below the poverty line and about 26.2% make double or less than double the poverty limit.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |first1= |title=Income and Poverty in the United States:2017 REPORT NUMBER P60-263 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html |website=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> Compared to households who identify as white those who identify as Black or Hispanic have higher rates of poverty. The households who identify as Asian actually have lower rates of poverty whether it is due to higher education here or immigrating already educated and ready to work but one thing is certain this contributes to the [[model minority]] stereotype that comes with, bringing along a whole new set of concepts not always good and causes more distance between Asians and other ethnic groups. Regardless of what the difference is between the Asian households and the others the disparities between the others is clear. A little more than twice the percentage of Black households are impoverished compared to white households and Hispanic households are about five percent more likely to be at or below the poverty line. Both Hispanic and Black households have about a six percent amount of households that make less than or double the poverty line compared to white households. As expected these differences also translate when considering households of each ethnic group that bring in six figures or more. Still based on the 2017 U.S. census data the percentage of households that identify as white alone who have over six figure incomes is 32.9%; only 16.1% of households that identify as Black have six figure incomes; 41.7% of households that identify as Asian have six figure incomes; and the percentage of Hispanic households that have six figure incomes or more is 19.8%.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Once again the same trend emerges here as with the poverty lines. There are disparities between the white households and the Black and Hispanic households. There are more than twice the percentage of Black households with six figure incomes compared to white households;on the other hand Hispanic households have 13% lower amount of households with six figure incomes comparatively. This shows how extensive the wealth gap is between the ethnic groups because they have more impoverished and less wealthy households. The wealth gap between ethnic groups has been present for a while and can be seen over time as median income in the following figure from the U.S. Census website. [[File:2017 Median income graph by ethnicity.png|thumb|2017 median income graph by ethnicity from the U.S. Census Bureau website]] This figure shows that even though as a whole every group got wealthier, the gap between the ethnic groups has stayed relatively the same or slightly grown. This is one of the key concepts of structural racism, there are poverty inequalities that have persisted for decades. Poverty leads to health issues, less higher education, more high school dropouts, more teenage pregnancy, and less opportunities. Therefore, a large part of structural racism has to do with perpetuating a cycle of poverty onto other ethnic groups which makes it substantially harder for them to get to same point or work there way up as a white person in America. This is because the impoverished start with less and because it has been a cycle of poverty most ethnic families do not have property, savings, or valuables to pass on, which just perpetuates the cycle further. These comparisons were not intended to ostracize,exclude, or lump any ethnic groups; there was not current data on Pacific Islander,Native American, or Middle Easterners in the U.S. Census Bureau study that was used.\n\n===Health inequities===\nThe cycle of poverty that structural racism imposes on minorities has adverse effects on their overall health, among other things. [[Health equity|Health inequities]] can manifest as disparities in several aspects of health such as obesity, heart disease, life span, infant mortality, sexual education, exercise, drug use, and cancer. Furthermore, racism itself is thought to have a negative impact on both mental and physical health. According to a paper that analyzed published research, on PubMed from the years 2005-2007, on the connection between discrimination and health there is an inverse relationship between the two; furthermore, the pattern is becoming more apparent across a greater variety of issues and data.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=David R. |last2=Mohammed |first2=Selina A. |title=Discrimination and racial disparities in health: evidence and needed research |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |date=22 November 2008 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201347 |doi=10.1007/s10865-008-9185-0 |pmid=19030981 |pmc=2821669 |issn=1573-3521}}</ref> The fact that a pattern has emerged from the study of this published research data shows that these health inequities are being maintained and reinforced by structural racism. Although this study relies on data from 2005-2007 to support it and show the pattern, this pattern was noticed as far back as 1985 and since then healthcare has come an even longer way. According to the 1985 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in general Americans were getting healthier and had increased longevity but there is a persisting inequality between Blacks and other minority groups in the rate of death and illness contrasting to the overall population; furthermore, the report notes that this inequality has been around for more than a generation at this point or since better, more factual federal records have been kept.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heckler |first1=Margret M. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |title=Executive Summary |journal=Report of the Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health |date=1985 |volume=1 |url=https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/1/ANDERSON.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> This is definitive proof that the federal government noticed these racial inequalities in health long before the 2005-2007 study of research data that revealed a pattern. More importantly it shows structural racism has maintained these health inequalities across decades even though in general Americans have become more healthy and have increased lifespans. Based on the studies they reviewed it became apparent that regardless of socioeconomic status racial inequalities in health were present between minority groups for several health issues such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This shows the health inequities caused by structural racism can be alleviated by increasing socioeconomic status but they still persist at all levels, showing the overarching power and cycle that structural racism submits minorities to. In addition, there is data that supports the fact that as health care has advanced worldwide overall there are more increases in health inequalities between races. One such study that supports this is The Progress Toward the Healthy People 2010 Goals and Objectives which is a review, done by members of the National Center for Health Statistics of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the Center of Excellence on Health Disparities, Morehouse School of Medicine, that explores progress towards improving the overall health quality and longevity of Americans and the health disparities between ethnic groups. To accomplish this they used a system of 31 measures to analyze the progress and disparities; which consisted of 10 leading health indicators (LHI), created by the Department of Health and Human Services, with a few objectives each for twenty two total and the remaining measures were formulated by the group who did the review.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite journal |last1=Sondik |first1=Edward J. |last2=Huang |first2=David T. |last3=Klein |first3=Richard J. |last4=Satcher |first4=David |title=Progress Toward the Healthy People 2010 Goals and Objectives |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |date=21 April 2010 |volume=31 |pages=271\u201381 4 p folliwng 281 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103613 |pmid=20070194 }}</ref> The ten leading health indicators are: Physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, responsible sexual behavior, mental health, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization, and access to healthcare; the group who did the review supplemented the leading health indicators with 7 more objectives and 2 more measures, infant mortality and life expectancy to give 31 in total.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> They used these measures to track the disparities be tween Asians, Hispanic or Latino, Black Non-Hispanics, white non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders; However it is important to note that data is not available for every ethnic group for all 31 measures. However using the available data for the objectives they have more than one time period on they found 6 objectives showed a decrease in disparity between ethnic groups and the national average while they found 18 disparity increases across 11 objectives.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> This confirms that even as healthcare is advancing and new scientific discoveries are being made overall the disparities between ethnic groups are increasing. This is a trend that was noticed in the 1985 report and has continued through the time worsening its effects and contributing to greater health inequalities. Therefore, it can be said that structural racism acts in such a way that it actively hinders the health and longevity of minorities.\n\n=== Relationship to agency ===\n[[Structure and agency]] are opposites.  [[Agency (sociology)|Agency]] is the idea that a person's life outcomes are due entirely, or significantly influenced by their own individual efforts.  [[Social structure]] is the idea that life outcomes are due entirely, or significantly influenced by the individual's race, class, gender, social status, inherited wealth, legal situation, and many other factors that are outside the individual's control.\n\nA society, even a [[race-blind|\"colorblind\"]] society, can be structured in a way that perpetuates racism and [[racial inequality]] even if its individual members do not hold bigoted views about members of other racial groups.  Society can still effectively exclude racially disadvantaged people from decision-making or make choices that have a [[disparate impact]] on them.<ref>Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo.
