At present, it consists of 117 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members]], directly elected from 117 single-seat constituencies.  The tenure of the Legislative Assembly is five years unless dissolved sooner. The current Speaker of the Assembly is [[Rana K. P. Singh]]. The meeting place of the Legislative Assembly since 6 March 1961 is the ''Vidhan Bhavan'' in [[Chandigarh]].\n\n== History ==\n=== British Raj ===\nAn Executive Council was formed under [[Indian Councils Act 1861|The Indian Councils Act, 1861]]. It was only under the [[Government of India Act 1919]] that a [[Punjab Legislative Assembly (British India)|Legislative Council]] was set up in Punjab.  Later, under the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Punjab Legislative Assembly was constituted with a membership of 175. It was summoned for the first time on 1 April 1937. In 1947, [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab Province]] was partitioned into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]] and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly was formed, the forerunner of the current assembly consisting of 79 members.\n\n=== 1947 \u2013 present ===\nOn 15 July 1948, eight princely states of East Punjab grouped together to form a single state, [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]]. The Punjab State Legislature was a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] house in April 1952, comprising the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (lower house) and [[Vidhan Parishad]] (upper house). In 1956 the state was reorganised and renamed Punjab, the strength of the Vidhan Parishad of the new State of Punjab was enhanced from 40 seats to 46 seats and in 1957, it was increased to 51. Punjab was trifurcated in 1966 to form [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and Punjab. The Vidhan Parishad was reduced to 40 seats and the Vidhan Sabha was grown by 50 seats to 104 seats. On 1 January 1970, the Vidhan Parishad was abolished leaving the state with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punjab Legislative Assembly |url=https://legislativebodiesinindia.nic.in/States/Punjab/punjab_w.htm |website=legislativebodiesinindia.nic.in |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Office bearer==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Office \n!Holder\n!Portrait \n!Since\n|-\n!colspan=4|Constitutional Posts\n|-\n|[[List of governors of Punjab (India)|Governor]]\n|[[V.

At present, it consists of 117 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|members]], directly elected from 117 single-seat constituencies.  The tenure of the Legislative Assembly is five years unless dissolved sooner. The current Speaker of the Assembly is [[Rana K. P. Singh]]. The meeting place of the Legislative Assembly since 6 March 1961 is the ''Vidhan Bhavan'' in [[Chandigarh]].\n\n== History ==\n=== British Raj ===\nAn Executive Council was formed under [[Indian Councils Act 1861|The Indian Councils Act, 1861]]. It was only under the [[Government of India Act 1919]] that a [[Punjab Legislative Assembly (British India)|Legislative Council]] was set up in Punjab.  Later, under the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Punjab Legislative Assembly was constituted with a membership of 175. It was summoned for the first time on 1 April 1937. In 1947, [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab Province]] was partitioned into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]] and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly was formed, the forerunner of the current assembly consisting of 79 members.\n\n=== 1947 \u2013 present ===\nOn 15 July 1948, eight princely states of East Punjab grouped together to form a single state, [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]]. The Punjab State Legislature was a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] house in April 1952, comprising the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (lower house) and [[Vidhan Parishad]] (upper house). In 1956 the state was reorganised and renamed Punjab, the strength of the Vidhan Parishad of the new State of Punjab was enhanced from 40 seats to 46 seats and in 1957, it was increased to 51. Punjab was trifurcated in 1966 to form [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and Punjab. The Vidhan Parishad was reduced to 40 seats and the Vidhan Sabha was grown by 50 seats to 104 seats. On 1 January 1970, the Vidhan Parishad was abolished leaving the state with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punjab Legislative Assembly |url=https://legislativebodiesinindia.nic.in/States/Punjab/punjab_w.htm |website=legislativebodiesinindia.nic.in |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Office bearer==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Office \n!Holder\n!Portrait \n!Since\n|-\n!colspan=4|Constitutional Posts\n|-\n|[[List of governors of Punjab (India)|Governor]]\n|[[V.
