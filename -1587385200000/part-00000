The success of the film provided an opportunity to feature in Mani Ratnam's multi-starrer ''[[Aayutha Ezhuthu]]'' (2004), before he branched off to receive critical and commercial acclaim in Telugu and Hindi cinema through ''[[Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana]]'' (2005), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' and ''[[Bommarillu]]'' (2006). In the late 2000s, he established himself as a bankable lead actor in Telugu films and subsequently chose to become more selective with his projects, while also winning acclaim for his work as a carrom player in ''[[Striker (2010 film)|Striker]]'' (2010) and as a blind warrior in the fantasy film ''[[Anaganaga O Dheerudu]]'' (2011).\n\nIn 2011, he returned to Tamil films after a sabbatical and produced [[Balaji Mohan]]'s commercially successful romantic comedy ''[[Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi]]'' (2012). The actor then had a prolific year in 2014, winning critical acclaim and box office success for his two ventures: ''[[Jigarthanda (2014 film)|Jigarthanda]]'', where he portrayed an aspiring film maker, and ''[[Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014 film)|Kaaviya Thalaivan]]'', in which he played an actor from the 1920s Madras theater scene.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSiddharth was born to a [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking family in Madras (present-day Chennai), India.<ref name=\"indiatimes1\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news-interviews/27784376_1_mani-ratnam-siddharth-films|title=The Siddharth way of life|work=The Times of India|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> He began his education at [[Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System|DAV]] Boys' Senior Secondary School, Madras and then studied at [[Sardar Patel Vidyalaya]], Delhi.<ref name=\"Idlebrainint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/siddardh.html|title=Interview with Siddardh by Jeevi|publisher=Idlebrain|accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> He subsequently graduated with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (Honors) degree from [[Kirori Mal College]], New Delhi.<ref name=\"indiatimes1\"/> Siddharth participated extensively in extra-curricular activities during college, serving as the president of the college's debating society and attending the World Debating Championships.

He has been featured in advertising because of his \"pan-Indian\" appeal.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913193626/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-03-28/news/31249880_1_pan-india-first-brand-ambassador-parle-agro|archive-date=13 September 2016|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-03-28/news/31249880_1_pan-india-first-brand-ambassador-parle-agro|title=Brands increasingly roping in Southern stars for pan-India ads|work=The Economic Times}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing his business management studies, Siddharth chose to work in film making and assisted [[Mani Ratnam]], before going on to make an acting debut in [[S. Shankar]]'s coming-of-age Tamil film ''[[Boys (2003 film)|Boys]]'' (2003). The success of the film provided an opportunity to feature in Mani Ratnam's multi-starrer ''[[Aayutha Ezhuthu]]'' (2004), before he branched off to receive critical and commercial acclaim in Telugu and Hindi cinema through ''[[Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana]]'' (2005), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' and ''[[Bommarillu]]'' (2006). In the late 2000s, he established himself as a bankable lead actor in Telugu films and subsequently chose to become more selective with his projects, while also winning acclaim for his work as a carrom player in ''[[Striker (2010 film)|Striker]]'' (2010) and as a blind warrior in the fantasy film ''[[Anaganaga O Dheerudu]]'' (2011).\n\nIn 2011, he returned to Tamil films after a sabbatical and produced [[Balaji Mohan]]'s commercially successful romantic comedy ''[[Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi]]'' (2012). The actor then had a prolific year in 2014, winning critical acclaim and box office success for his two ventures: ''[[Jigarthanda (2014 film)|Jigarthanda]]'', where he portrayed an aspiring film maker, and ''[[Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014 film)|Kaaviya Thalaivan]]'', in which he played an actor from the 1920s Madras theater scene.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSiddharth was born to a [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking family in Madras (present-day Chennai), India.<ref name=\"indiatimes1\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news-interviews/27784376_1_mani-ratnam-siddharth-films|title=The Siddharth way of life|work=The Times of India|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> He began his education at [[Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System|DAV]] Boys' Senior Secondary School, Madras and then studied at [[Sardar Patel Vidyalaya]], Delhi.<ref name=\"Idlebrainint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/siddardh.html|title=Interview with Siddardh by Jeevi|publisher=Idlebrain|accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> He subsequently graduated with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (Honors) degree from [[Kirori Mal College]], New Delhi.<ref name=\"indiatimes1\"/> Siddharth participated extensively in extra-curricular activities during college, serving as the president of the college's debating society and attending the World Debating Championships.
