When serum IgE is normal (and patients are not being treated by [[glucocorticoid]] medications), ABPA is excluded as the cause of symptoms. A raised IgE increases suspicion, though there is no universally accepted cut-off value. Values can be stated in [[international units]] (IU/mL) or ng/mL, where 1 IU is equal to 2.4&nbsp;ng/mL. Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833\u20131000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further serological testing. The current consensus is that a cut-off of 1000 IU/mL should be employed, as lower values are encountered in SAFS and asthmatic [[sensitization]].<ref name=Agarwal2013/>\n\nIgG antibody [[precipitin]] testing from serum is useful, as positive results are found in between 69\u201390% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be used in conjunction with other tests. Various forms exist, including [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme [[immunoassay]] (FEIA).

The antifungal aspect aims to reduce fungal causes of bronchial inflammation, whilst also minimising the dose of corticosteroid required to reduce the immune system's input to disease progression. The strongest evidence (double-blinded, [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo]]-controlled trials) is for [[itraconazole]] twice daily for four months, which resulted in significant clinical improvement compared to placebo, and was mirrored in CF patients.

Metabolic disorders, such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[osteoporosis]], can also be induced.<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, corticosteroid doses are decreased biweekly assuming no further progression of disease after each reduction.  When no [[exacerbation]]s from the disease are seen within three months after discontinuing corticosteroids, the patient is considered to be in complete [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. The exception to this rule is patients who are diagnosed with advanced ABPA; in this case removing corticosteroids almost always results in exacerbation and these patients are continued on low-dose corticosteroids (preferably on an alternate-day schedule).<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\nSerum IgE can be used to guide treatment, and levels are checked every 6\u20138 weeks after steroid treatment commences, followed by every 8 weeks for one year.

These are likely underestimates of total prevalence, given the exclusion of CF patients and children from the study, as well as diagnostic testing being limited in less developed regions.<ref name=Denning2013/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 956\n| ICD10           = \n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|518.6}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 103920\n| MedlinePlus     = 000070\n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| eMedicine_mult  = {{eMedicine2|radio|55}}\n| MeshID          = D001229\n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|B44.81}}\n| Orphanet        = 1164\n}}\n*[http://www.fungalresearchtrust.org Fungal Research Trust]\n*[http://www.aspergillus.org.uk Aspergillus Website]\n*[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1100611584 Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis] \u2014 GP Notebook\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512002159/http://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=caption_search&srchstr=allergic+bronchopulmonary+aspergillosis#top/ Medpix.

It occurs most often in people with [[asthma]] or [[cystic fibrosis]]. ''Aspergillus'' [[spore]]s are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in the [[sputum]] of healthy individuals. ''A. fumigatus'' is responsible for a spectrum of lung diseases known as [[aspergillosis|aspergilloses]].\n\nABPA causes [[airway]] [[inflammation]], leading to [[bronchiectasis]]\u2014a condition marked by abnormal dilation of the airways. Left untreated, the [[immune system]] and fungal spores can damage sensitive lung tissues and lead to scarring.\n\nThe exact criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA are not agreed upon. [[Chest X-ray]]s and [[CT scan]]s, raised blood levels of [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] and [[eosinophilia|eosinophil]]s, immunological tests for ''Aspergillus'' together with sputum [[Gram staining|staining]] and [[sputum culture]]s can be useful.

When serum IgE is normal (and patients are not being treated by [[glucocorticoid]] medications), ABPA is excluded as the cause of symptoms. A raised IgE increases suspicion, though there is no universally accepted cut-off value. Values can be stated in [[international units]] (IU/mL) or ng/mL, where 1 IU is equal to 2.4&nbsp;ng/mL. Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833\u20131000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further serological testing. The current consensus is that a cut-off of 1000 IU/mL should be employed, as lower values are encountered in SAFS and asthmatic [[sensitization]].<ref name=Agarwal2013/>\n\nIgG antibody [[precipitin]] testing from serum is useful, as positive results are found in between 69\u201390% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be used in conjunction with other tests. Various forms exist, including [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme [[immunoassay]] (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional [[counterimmunoelectrophoresis]].

Any other co-morbidities, such as sinusitis or rhinitis, should also be addressed.<ref name=Walsh2008>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=TJ|author2=Anaissie, EJ|author3= Denning, DW|author4= Herbrecht, R|author5= Kontoyiannis, DP|author6= Marr, KA|author7= Morrison, VA|author8= Segal, BH|author9= Steinbach, WJ|author10= Stevens, DA|author11= van Burik, JA|author12= Wingard, JR|author13= Patterson, TF|author14= Infectious Diseases Society of America|title=Treatment of aspergillosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=1 February 2008 |volume=46|issue=3|pages=327\u201360|pmid=18177225|doi=10.1086/525258}}</ref>\n\n[[Hypersensitivity]] mechanisms, [[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis#Pathophysiology|as described above]], contribute to progression of the disease over time and, when left untreated, result in extensive [[fibrosis]] of lung tissue. In order to reduce this, [[corticosteroid]] therapy is the mainstay of treatment (for example with [[prednisone]]); however, studies involving corticosteroids in ABPA are limited by small [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s and are often not [[double-blinded]]. Despite this, there is evidence that acute-onset ABPA is improved by corticosteroid treatment as it reduces episodes of [[Consolidation (medicine)|consolidation]]. There are challenges involved in long-term therapy with corticosteroids\u2014which can induce severe [[immune dysfunction]] when used chronically, as well as [[metabolism|metabolic]] disorders\u2014and approaches have been developed to manage ABPA alongside potential [[adverse effects]] from corticosteroids.<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012>{{cite journal|last=Mahdavinia|first=M|author2=Grammer, LC|title=Management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a review and update|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease|date=June 2012 |volume=6|issue=3|pages=173\u201387|pmid=22547692|doi=10.1177/1753465812443094}}</ref>\n\nThe most commonly described technique, known as sparing, involves using an [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent to clear spores from airways adjacent to corticosteroid therapy. The antifungal aspect aims to reduce fungal causes of bronchial inflammation, whilst also minimising the dose of corticosteroid required to reduce the immune system's input to disease progression. The strongest evidence (double-blinded, [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo]]-controlled trials) is for [[itraconazole]] twice daily for four months, which resulted in significant clinical improvement compared to placebo, and was mirrored in CF patients. Using itraconazole appears to outweigh the risk from long-term and high-dose prednisone. Newer [[triazole]] drugs\u2014such as [[posaconazole]] or [[voriconazole]]\u2014have not yet been studied in-depth through [[clinical trial]]s in this context.<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\nWhilst the benefits of using corticosteroids in the short term are notable, and improve [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] scores, there are cases of ABPA converting to [[Aspergillosis|invasive aspergillosis]] whilst undergoing corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, in concurrent use with itraconazole, there is potential for [[drug interaction]] and the induction of [[Cushing syndrome]] in rare instances. Metabolic disorders, such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[osteoporosis]], can also be induced.<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, corticosteroid doses are decreased biweekly assuming no further progression of disease after each reduction.  When no [[exacerbation]]s from the disease are seen within three months after discontinuing corticosteroids, the patient is considered to be in complete [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. The exception to this rule is patients who are diagnosed with advanced ABPA; in this case removing corticosteroids almost always results in exacerbation and these patients are continued on low-dose corticosteroids (preferably on an alternate-day schedule).<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\nSerum IgE can be used to guide treatment, and levels are checked every 6\u20138 weeks after steroid treatment commences, followed by every 8 weeks for one year. This allows for a determination of baseline IgE levels, though it's important to note that most patients do not entirely reduce IgE levels to baseline. [[Chest X-ray]] or CT scans are performed after 1\u20132 months of treatment to ensure [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrates]] are resolving.<ref name=Walsh2008/><ref name=Mahdavinia2012/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThere are limited national and international studies into the burden of ABPA, made more difficult by a non-standardized diagnostic criteria.

From 193 million asthma sufferers worldwide, ABPA prevalence in asthma is estimated between the extremes of 1.35\u20136.77 million sufferers, using 0.7\u20133.5% attrition rates. A compromise at 2.5% attrition has also been proposed, placing global burden at around 4.8 million people affected. The Eastern Mediterranean region had the lowest estimated prevalence, with a predicted case burden of 351,000; collectively, the Americas had the highest predicted burden at 1,461,000 cases. These are likely underestimates of total prevalence, given the exclusion of CF patients and children from the study, as well as diagnostic testing being limited in less developed regions.<ref name=Denning2013/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 956 \n|  ICD10           =  \n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|518.6}}  \n|  ICDO            =  \n|  OMIM            = 103920  \n|  MedlinePlus     = 000070  \n|  eMedicineSubj   =  \n|  eMedicineTopic  =  \n|  eMedicine_mult  = {{eMedicine2|radio|55}}  \n|  MeshID          = D001229 \n}}\n*[http://www.fungalresearchtrust.org Fungal Research Trust]\n*[http://www.aspergillus.org.uk Aspergillus Website]\n*[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1100611584 Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis] \u2014 GP Notebook\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512002159/http://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=caption_search&srchstr=allergic+bronchopulmonary+aspergillosis#top/ Medpix.

Causes of atrophy include [[mutation]]s (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor [[circulatory system|circulation]], loss of [[hormone|hormonal]] support, loss of [[nerve]] supply to the target [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]], excessive amount of [[apoptosis]] of cells, and disuse or lack of [[exercise]] or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have ''trophic'' effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as ''atrophy''. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell, organ or tissue, after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast, hypoplasia is the reduction in size of a cell, organ, or tissue that has not attained normal maturity.\n\nAtrophy is the general [[physiological]] process of reabsorption and breakdown of [[biological tissue|tissues]], involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support because of other diseases, it is termed ''pathological atrophy'', although it can be a part of normal body development and [[homeostasis]] as well.\n\n==Normal development==\n{{-plasia}}\nExamples of atrophy as part of normal development include shrinking and the involution of the [[thymus]] in early childhood, and the [[tonsil]]s in adolescence. In old age, effects include, but are not limited to, loss of teeth, hair, thinning of skin that creates wrinkles, weakening of muscles, loss of weight in organs and sluggish mental activity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disease and Its Causes|year=1913|publisher=New York Henry Holt and Company London [[Williams and Norgate]] The University Press, Cambridge, U.S.A.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1499279&pageno=21|author=W.

This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe.  Astronauts in microgravity must exercise regularly to minimize atrophy of their limb muscles.\n\nThere are many diseases and conditions which cause atrophy of muscle mass.  For example, diseases such as cancer and AIDS induce a body wasting syndrome called ''[[cachexia]]'', which is notable for the severe muscle atrophy seen.  Other syndromes or conditions which can induce [[skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] atrophy are [[congestive heart failure]] and liver disease.\n\nDuring aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass.  This condition is called ''[[sarcopenia]]'', and may be distinct from atrophy in its pathophysiology.  While the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, it may be induced by a combination of a gradual failure in the [[satellite cells]] which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003188.htm | title = Muscle atrophy | publisher= [[MedlinePlus]] | accessdate = 2007-10-02 | date = 2007-05-22 | last = Campellone | first = Joseph V. | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013000952/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003188.htm| archivedate= 13 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Dystrophies, myositis, and motor neuron conditions ==\n\nPathologic atrophy of muscles can occur with diseases of the motor nerves or diseases of the muscle tissue itself.

He is generally considered the greatest of the 19th-century [[Starets|startsy]] (elders).  Seraphim extended the [[monasticism|monastic]] teachings of [[contemplation]], [[theoria]] and [[self-denial]] to the [[layperson]]. He taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to acquire the [[Holy Spirit]]. Perhaps his most popular quotation amongst Orthodox believers is ''\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and thousands around you will be saved.\"''\n\nSeraphim was [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1903. Alongside his veneration in the Catholic calendar, [[Pope John Paul II]] also referred to him as a Saint.<ref>Pope John Paul II, ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', (Knopf, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-679-76561-5}}, page 18.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Seraphim feeding a bear outside of his [[hermitage (religious retreat)]] (from lithograph ''The Way to Sarov'', 1903).]]\n[[File:Seraphim of Sarov - pilgrim spot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pilgrim spot]]\n\nBorn 19 July (O.S.) 1754, the future saint was [[baptism|baptized]] with the name of Prochor, after [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], one of the first [[Seven Deacons]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of [[John the Evangelist]]. His parents, Isidore and Agathia Moshnin, lived in [[Kursk, Russia]]. His father was a merchant. According to [[Orthodox Church]] tradition, a [[wonderworking]] [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Virgin Mary]]), [[Our Lady of Kursk]], healed the young boy. Seraphim later experienced a number of [[vision (religion)|visions]].\n\nIn 1775, at the age of 17, he visited Dorothea of Kiev.\n\nIn 1777, at the age of 19, he joined the [[Sarov]] monastery as a [[novice]] (''poslushnik''). He was officially [[tonsure]]d (took his [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monastic vows]]) in 1786 and given the religious name of Seraphim (which means \"fiery\" or \"burning\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). Shortly afterwards, he was [[ordained]] a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic [[deacon]]). In 1793, he was ordained as a [[hieromonk]] (monastic [[priest]]) and became the spiritual leader of the Diveyevo Convent, which has since come to be known as the [[Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery|Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent]].\n\nSoon after this, Seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside [[Sarov]] monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a [[hermit]] for 25 years.

He never resisted, and was left for dead. The robbers never found the money they sought, only an [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) in his hut. Seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life. However, at the thieves' trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf.\n\n\"After this incident, Seraphim spent 5 months in the monastery, recovering, and there again returned to the desert, for the former spiritual feats.\" (\"\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043c \u0421\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446\" \u2013 \u0441\u0442\u0440. 14)\n\nAfter this incident Seraphim spent 1,000 successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky, a feat of [[asceticism]] deemed miraculous by the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially considering the pain from his injuries.\n\nIn 1815, in obedience to a reputed [[vision (religion)|spiritual experience]] that he attributed to the Virgin Mary, Seraphim began admitting [[pilgrims]] to his hermitage as a [[confessor]]. He soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for [[thaumaturge|healing powers]] and gift of [[prophecy]]. Hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him, drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests' questions before they could ask.\n\nAs extraordinarily harsh as Seraphim often was to himself, he was kind and gentle toward others \u2014 always greeting his guests with a [[prostration]], a [[kiss of peace|kiss]], and exclaiming [[Paschal greeting|\"Christ is risen!\"]], and calling everyone \"My joy.\" He died while kneeling before an ''Umilenie'' icon of the Theotokos which he called \"Joy of all Joys\".

These would be the last prayers offered for Seraphim as a departed servant of God; from that time forward, prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint. On 19 July, Seraphim's birthday, the late liturgy began at 8 o'clock. At the [[Little Entrance]], twelve [[archimandrite]]s lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the [[Holy Table]] (altar), then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them.\n\nThe festivities at Sarov ended with the [[consecration]] of the first two churches dedicated to St. Seraphim. The first had been constructed over his [[monastic cell]] in the wilderness of Sarov. The second church was consecrated on 22 July at the [[Diveyevo]] [[convent]].\n\nFollowing the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities severely persecuted religious groups.  As part of their [[persecution of Christians]], they confiscated many relics of saints, including St. Seraphim. Furthermore, his biographer [[Seraphim Chichagov]], who came to become a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], was arrested, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1937 (and is also celebrated as a Russian Orthodox saint).\n\nIn 1991, St. Seraphim's relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a [[religion in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-religious]] museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia and throughout the Orthodox world. A [[crucession]] (religious [[procession]]) escorted the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to Diveyevo Convent, where they remain to this day.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, relics of Seraphim were launched into space aboard the [[Soyuz MS-02]].<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/907848|title=Soyuz MS-02 spacecraft docking the International Space Station|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeraphim is a patron saint of Russia's nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2019/07/11/russian-orthodox-church-considers-ending-blessings-for-nuclear-weapons/|title=Russian Orthodox Church considers ending blessings for nuclear weapons||publisher=Catholic Herald|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n<blockquote>\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and around you thousands will be saved.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"It is necessary that the Holy Spirit enter our heart.

He is generally considered the greatest of the 19th-century [[Starets|startsy]] (elders).  Seraphim extended the [[monasticism|monastic]] teachings of [[contemplation]], [[theoria]] and [[self-denial]] to the [[layperson]]. He taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to acquire the [[Holy Spirit]]. Perhaps his most popular quotation amongst Orthodox believers is ''\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and thousands around you will be saved.\"''\n\nSeraphim was [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1903. Alongside his veneration in the Catholic calendar, [[Pope John Paul II]] also referred to him as a Saint.<ref>Pope John Paul II, ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', (Knopf, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-679-76561-5}}, page 18.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Seraphim feeding a bear outside of his [[hermitage (religious retreat)]] (from lithograph ''The Way to Sarov'', 1903).]]\n[[File:Seraphim of Sarov - pilgrim spot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pilgrim spot]]\n\nBorn 19 July (O.S.) 1754, the future saint was [[baptism|baptized]] with the name of Prochor, after [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], one of the first [[Seven Deacons]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of [[John the Evangelist]]. His parents, Isidore and Agathia Moshnin, lived in [[Kursk, Russia]]. His father was a merchant. According to [[Orthodox Church]] tradition, a [[wonderworking]] [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Virgin Mary]]), [[Our Lady of Kursk]], healed the young boy. Seraphim later experienced a number of [[vision (religion)|visions]].\n\nIn 1775, at the age of 17, he visited Dorothea of Kiev.\n\nIn 1777, at the age of 19, he joined the [[Sarov]] monastery as a [[novice]] (''poslushnik''). He was officially [[tonsure]]d (took his [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monastic vows]]) in 1786 and given the religious name of Seraphim (which means \"fiery\" or \"burning\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). Shortly afterwards, he was [[ordained]] a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic [[deacon]]). In 1793, he was ordained as a [[hieromonk]] (monastic [[priest]]) and became the spiritual leader of the Diveyevo Convent, which has since come to be known as the [[Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery|Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent]].\n\nSoon after this, Seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside [[Sarov]] monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a [[hermit]] for 25 years. During this time his feet became swollen to the point that he had trouble walking. Sarov's eating and [[fasting]] habits became more strict.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\">Johnston, William M. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. p. 1146. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-090-2}}</ref> At first he ate bread obtained from the monastery and vegetables from his garden, then only vegetables. For three years, he ate only grass.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\"/>\n\n[[File:Motovilov.gif|thumb|[[Nicholas Motovilov]], one of Seraphim's most well-known [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].]]\n\nOne day, while chopping wood, Seraphim was attacked by a gang of thieves who beat him mercilessly with the handle of his own axe. He never resisted, and was left for dead. The robbers never found the money they sought, only an [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) in his hut. Seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life. However, at the thieves' trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf.\n\n\"After this incident, Seraphim spent 5 months in the monastery, recovering, and there again returned to the desert, for the former spiritual feats.\" (\"\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043c \u0421\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446\" \u2013 \u0441\u0442\u0440. 14)\n\nAfter this incident Seraphim spent 1,000 successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky, a feat of [[asceticism]] deemed miraculous by the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially considering the pain from his injuries.\n\nIn 1815, in obedience to a reputed [[vision (religion)|spiritual experience]] that he attributed to the Virgin Mary, Seraphim began admitting [[pilgrims]] to his hermitage as a [[confessor]]. He soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for [[thaumaturge|healing powers]] and gift of [[prophecy]]. Hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him, drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests' questions before they could ask.\n\nAs extraordinarily harsh as Seraphim often was to himself, he was kind and gentle toward others \u2014 always greeting his guests with a [[prostration]], a [[kiss of peace|kiss]], and exclaiming [[Paschal greeting|\"Christ is risen!\"]], and calling everyone \"My joy.\" He died while kneeling before an ''Umilenie'' icon of the Theotokos which he called \"Joy of all Joys\".

These would be the last prayers offered for Seraphim as a departed servant of God; from that time forward, prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint. On 19 July, Seraphim's birthday, the late liturgy began at 8 o'clock. At the [[Little Entrance]], twelve [[archimandrite]]s lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the [[Holy Table]] (altar), then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them.\n\nThe festivities at Sarov ended with the [[consecration]] of the first two churches dedicated to St. Seraphim. The first had been constructed over his [[monastic cell]] in the wilderness of Sarov. The second church was consecrated on 22 July at the [[Diveyevo]] [[convent]].\n\nFollowing the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities severely persecuted religious groups.  As part of their [[persecution of Christians]], they confiscated many relics of saints, including St. Seraphim. Furthermore, his biographer [[Seraphim Chichagov]], who came to become a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], was arrested, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1937 (and is also celebrated as a Russian Orthodox saint).\n\nIn 1991, St. Seraphim's relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a [[religion in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-religious]] museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia and throughout the Orthodox world. A [[crucession]] (religious [[procession]]) escorted the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to Diveyevo Convent, where they remain to this day.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, relics of Seraphim were launched into space aboard the [[Soyuz MS-02]].<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/907848|title=Soyuz MS-02 spacecraft docking the International Space Station|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeraphim is a patron saint of Russia's nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2019/07/11/russian-orthodox-church-considers-ending-blessings-for-nuclear-weapons/|title=Russian Orthodox Church considers ending blessings for nuclear weapons||publisher=Catholic Herald|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n<blockquote>\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and around you thousands will be saved.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"It is necessary that the Holy Spirit enter our heart.

The ''Triumph'' album sold three million copies in its original run. Hit singles from the album were \"Lovely One\", \"Heartbreak Hotel\" (which was renamed \"[[This Place Hotel]]\" to avoid confusion with the [[Elvis Presley]] [[Heartbreak Hotel|song of the same name]]) and \"[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]\".\n\nThe Jacksons shared [[Singing|lead vocals]] and solo spots on some songs, but [[Michael Jackson]], who had recently released his multi-platinum selling album, ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'', handles most of the lead vocal and writing duties. ''Triumph'' was the Jacksons' first album to reach number-one on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|R&B Albums chart]] since ''[[Maybe Tomorrow (The Jackson 5 album)|Maybe Tomorrow]]'' in 1971. The album sold over two million copies worldwide,<ref>Chery, Carl: ''XXL: Michael Jackson Special Collecters Edition'', page 100. American Press.</ref> and the Jacksons did not release another studio LP until ''[[Victory (The Jacksons album)|Victory]]'' in 1984. On December 10, 1980, the album was certified Platinum for the sales of over 1 million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS/ |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629082431/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS/ |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Re-release==\n''Triumph'', with three bonus tracks of rare 7-inch and 12-inch mixes previously unavailable on CD, was re-released on January 27, 2009 on Epic/Legacy, a division of [[Sony Music Entertainment]].<ref>[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 LegacyRecordings.com \u00bb News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044158/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 |date=2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1  = [[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]\n| writer1 = [[Michael Jackson]]\n| length1 = 6:00\n| title2  = [[Lovely One]]\n| writer2 = Michael Jackson\n| length2 = 4:52\n| title3  = Your Ways\n| writer3 = Jackie Jackson\n| length3 = 4:31\n| title4  = Everybody\n| writer4 = Michael Jackson\n| length4 = 5:00\n| title5  = [[This Place Hotel]]\n| writer5 = Michael Jackson\n| length5 = 5:44\n| title6  = Time Waits for No One\n| writer6 = Jackie Jackson, Randy Jackson\n| length6 = 3:24\n| title7  = [[Walk Right Now]]\n| writer7 = Michael Jackson\n| length7 = 6:29\n| title8  = Give It Up\n| writer8 = Michael Jackson\n| length8 = 4:20\n| title9  = Wondering Who\n| writer9 = Jackie Jackson, Randy Jackson\n| length9 = 4:19\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = no\n| headline = 2009 re-edition bonus tracks\n| title10  = This Place Hotel\n| note10   = Single Version\n| length10 = 4:52\n| title11  = Walk Right Now\n| note11   = John Luongo Disco Mix\n| length11 = 7:36\n| title12  = Walk Right Now\n| note12   = John Luongo Instrumental Mix\n| length12 = 6:58\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n===The Jacksons===\n*[[Michael Jackson]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals\n*[[Jackie Jackson]] \u2013 backing vocals, lead vocals (track 9)\n*[[Tito Jackson]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\n*[[Marlon Jackson]] \u2013 backing vocals, timpani (track 5), co-lead vocals (track 8)\n*[[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]] \u2013 percussion, backing vocals, co-lead vocals (track 1)\n\n===Additional personnel===\n{{Div col}}\n*[[David Williams (guitarist)|David Williams]] \u2013 guitar (1-5, 7-9)\n*[[Paul Jackson, Jr.]] \u2013 guitar (5)\n*Greg Poree \u2013 guitar (6)\n*[[Michael Sembello]] \u2013 guitar (2, 5, 8)\n*[[Phil Upchurch]] \u2013 guitar (3)\n*[[Michael Boddicker]] \u2013 synthesizer (7, 9)\n*[[Ronnie Foster]] \u2013 keyboards (1, 9)\n*Webster Lewis \u2013 synthesizer (7)\n*[[Greg Phillinganes]] \u2013 keyboards (1-9), synthesizers (7)\n*Gary Coleman \u2013 vibraphone (1, 7, 8)\n*Clay Drayton \u2013 bass (6, 8)\n*Mike McKinney \u2013 bass (4)\n*[[Nathan Watts]] \u2013 bass (1-3, 5, 7)\n*[[Ollie E.

Pepi's mother was queen [[Iput]], who may have been a daughter of [[Unas]], final ruler of the [[Fifth Dynasty|Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]].\n\nPepi seems to have faced the decline of the pharaoh's power, which he tried to buttress by forming alliances with the provincial nomarch of Abydos, two daughters of whom became queens of Egypt. Pepi's first [[throne name]] was ''Neferdjahor'' which the king later altered to ''Meryre'' meaning \"beloved of [[R\u00ea]]\".{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}}\n\nPepi was succeeded by his son [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I]], who reigned only briefly. He was in turn succeeded by [[Pepi II]], who may have been another son of Pepi I by [[Ankhesenpepi II]], although he could instead be a grandson of Pepi I by Merenre I. Pepi II was the last great pharaoh of the Old Kingdom period.\n\n==Family==\n===Parents===\nPepi was the son of [[Teti]] and queen [[Iput]],{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=64 \u2013 65 & 76}} who may have been a daughter of [[Unas]] the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty.{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}} That Pepi was indeed a son of Iput is demonstrated by a relief on a decree uncovered in Koptos, which mentions Iput as Pepi's mother.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}}\n\n===Consorts===\n[[File:Queen_of_Pepy_II.jpg|thumb|upright|Ankhesenpepi II shown on a relief from her mortuary temple]]\nAt least eight consorts of Pepi I have been identified. These include [[Meritites IV]], [[Nubwenet]] and [[Inenek-Inti]], who are buried in pyramids adjacent to that of Pepi,{{sfn|Leclant|1999|p=866}} Mehaa, who is named in the tomb of her son Hornetjerkhet, and a queen named [[Nedjeftet]] who is mentioned on relief fragments.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=73}}. Pepi's most prominent wives were [[Ankhesenpepi I]] and [[Ankhesenpepi II]], both daughters of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife [[Nebet]].{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=73}} A final queen, named Weret-Yamtes,{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=83}} is known from the inscriptions uncovered in the tomb of Weni, an official serving Pepi. This queen apparently conspired against Pepi but was prosecuted when the conspiracy was discovered.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|pp=82\u201383}}\n\n===Children===\nPepi fathered at least three sons and a daughter. Ankhesenpepi I in all likelyhood bore him the future pharaoh [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I]]. In an alternative hypothesis, Hans Goedicke has proposed that Merenre's mother was the queen Were-Yamtes, responsible for the harem conspiracy against Pepi I. In this hypothesis, Ankhesenpepi I was claimed to be Merenre's mother to safeguard Merenre's claim to the throne.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Ankhesenpepi II was the mother of [[Pepi II Neferkare]],{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} who was likely born at the very end of his father's reign given that he was only 6 upon ascending the throne after Merenre's own reign.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Another son of Pepi with an as yet unidentified consort was Teti-ankh, meaning \"Teti lives\".{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} Teti-ankh is known only from an ink inscription bearing his name discovered in Pepi's pyramid.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=78}} Buried nearby is prince Hornetjerkhet, a son of Pepi with queen Mehaa.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} Pepi I's daughters include possibly [[Neith (wife of Pepi II)|Neith]] and [[Iput II]], both future wives of Pepi II.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E., 39.121.jpg|thumb|upright|Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, [[Brooklyn Museum]]{{efn|group=note|catalog number 39.121}}]]\n\n===Political situation===\n====Acending the throne====\nPepi's accession to the throne might have occurred in times of discord, as his father Teti is said by Manetho to have been assassinated by his own bodyguards.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=53}}{{sfn|Rice|1999|p=150}} [[Naguib Kanawati]] has argued in support of Manetho's claim, noting for example that Teti's reign saw an important increase in the number of guards at the Egyptian court, with these becoming responsible for the everyday care of the king.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=184}}\nAt the same time, the figures and names of several palace officials as represented in their tombs had been purposefully erased.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=173}} The attempted [[damnatio memoriae]] targeted three men in particular, the [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Heri, the overseer of weapons Mereri and chief physician Seankhuiptah who may therefore be behind the murder.{{sfn|Hubschmann|2011|p=2}}\n\nPepi was by then perhaps too young a child to reign. In any case, he did not immediately succeed his father who was rather succeeded by king [[Userkare]]. Userkare's identity and relation with the royal family remains uncertain. It is possible that he served only as a regent with Pepi's mother Iput as Pepi reached adulthood,{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=81}} or occupied the throne in the interregnum.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=191}}\nSuch hypotheses are supported by the apparent lack of resistance against Pepi ultimately taking the throne.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=81}} Against this view however, Kanawati has argued that Userkare's reign length\u2014at no more than five years\u2014is too short for a regency and that a regent would not have assumed a full royal titulary as Userkare did nor would he be included in king lists.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=184}} \n\nNonetheless, Pepi chose the Horus name of ''Mery-tawy'', meaning \"He who is loved by the two lands\", which Nicolas Grimal sees as an indication that he desired political appeasement.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=82}} Similarly, Pepi chose the throne name ''Nefersahor'', meaning \"Perfect is the protection of Horus\", which he only later changed to Meryre \"Beloved of Ra\".{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|p=104}} Although there seems not to be a direct relation between Userkare's brief reign and a later conspiracy in his harem, these events suggest some form of political instability at the time.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=82}}\n\n[[File:Cylinder Seal with the Name of Pepi I MET 17-5.jpg|thumb|upright|Turquoise cylinder seal of an official of Pepi I, \"Sole companion, lector priest, who does what is ordered [...] privy to the secret(s) of the king\"{{sfn|MET Cylinder|2020|loc=catalog number 17.5}}]]\n====Policies====\nIn a long trend that started earlier in the Fifth Dynasty, the Old Kingdom Egyptian state was the subject of increasing decentralization and regionalization. This process, well under way during Pepi I's reign, progressively weakened the king's primacy and ascendancy over his own administration and would ultimately result in the princedoms of the First Intermediate Period.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=16}} Pepi seems to have developed several policies to counteract this, notably with the constructions of royal Ka chapels throughout Egypt,{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=16}}{{sfn|Fischer|1958|pp=330\u2013333}} to strengthen the royal presence in the provinces.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=17}}\n\nLater in this reign, possibly around his 44th year on the throne,{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Pepi faced a conspiracy hatched by one of his harem consort, Weret-Yamtes. Although the precise nature of her crime is not reported by Weni who served as a judge during the subsequent trial, this at least shows that the person of the king was not untouchable anymore.{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|p=105}} According to Hans Goedicke, Weret-Yamtes may have been the mother of Merenre,{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} while Nicolas Grimal sees this as highly unlikely, as Weret-Yamtes' son would have been punished together her.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|pp=82\u201383}} Perhaps in response to these events, late in his reign Pepi married two daughters of Khui, nomarch of Abydos.{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|pp=104\u2013105}} This may also have served to counteract the weakening of the king's authority over Middle and Upper Egypt by securing the allegiance of a powerful family.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=192}} The political importance of this marriage is demonstrated by the fact that, for the first and last time until the 26th Dynasty some 1800 years later,  Khui's wife [[Nebet]], a woman, was made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] of Upper Egypt.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=173}} Later, Khui's and Nebet's son [[Djau]] was made vizier as well. Pepi's marriages might be at the origin{{sfn|Yurco|1999|p=240}} of a trend, which continued during the later Sixth and [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasties]], in which the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]] in Koptos was the focus of much royal patronage.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} This is manifested by the [[Coptos Decrees]], which record successive pharaohs granting tax exemptions to the temple as well as official honors bestowed by the kings to the local ruling family while the Old Kingdom society was collapsing.{{sfn|Hayes|1946|pp=3\u201323}}\n\nThis part of Pepi's rule may not have been any less troubled than his early reign, as Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced yet another conspiracy against him, in which his vizier [[Rawer (vizier)|Rawer]] could have been involved. To support his theory, Kanawati observes that Rawer's image in his tomb has been desecrated, with his name, hands and feet chiselled off, while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepi's reign on stylistic grounds.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=177}} Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else designated heir to the throne at the expense of Merenre. Consequently to the failure of this conspiracy, Pepi I would have taken the drastic step of crowning Merenre during his own reign, thereby creating the earliest documented coregency of the history of Egypt.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=177}} That such a coregency did indeed take place is indirectly supported by a gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as kings, an inscription mentioning king Merenre in Hatnub which suggests that he counted his years of reign starting at some point during his father's reign and the copper statues of Hierakonpolis, discussed below.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=192}}\n\n====Building activities====\n[[File:Hidden treasures 09.jpg|thumb|upright|Smaller copper statue representing Merenre or a young Pepi I, from Hierakonpolis]]\nPepi I built extensively throughout Egypt, mostly devoting the building efforts to local cults{{sfn|Hayes|1978|p=126}} and royal Ka chapels.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|pp=16\u201317}}\nIn [[Dendera]], where a fragmentary statue of a seated Pepi I has been uncovered,{{sfn|Daumas|1952|pp=163\u2013172}} Pepi I restored the [[Dendera Temple complex|temple complex]] to the goddess [[Hathor]].{{sfn|Cauville|1999|p=298}}\nIn Abydos,{{sfn|O'Connor|1999|p=110}} he built a small rock cut chapel dedicated to the local god [[Khenti-Amentiu]],{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=13}} where he is referred to as \"Pepi, Son of Hathor of Dendera\".{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=1}} \nIn the same locality Pepi might also have had a small [[Ancient_Egyptian_conception_of_the_soul#k\ua723_\"double\"|Ka]]-chapel built for himself.{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=17}}{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=20}} Such chapels comprised one or more chambers for the bringing of offerings dedicated to the cult of the Ka of a deceased or of the king.{{sfn|Bolshakov|2001|p=217}} \nLike his father Teti, Pepi had such a chapel built in [[Bubastis]],{{sfn|Lange|2016|p=121}} in the Nile Delta region, \nas well as another one built in [[Nekhen|Hierakonpolis]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1992|pp=91\u201392|loc=fig. 5A}}{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} in Upper Egypt and possibly also in [[Elkab]] where rock inscriptions refer to his funerary cult.{{sfn|Hendrickx|1999|p=344}} Further Ka chapels of Pepi have been found in Memphis, Zawyet el-Meytin, [[Assiut]] and [[Nagada]].{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|pp=16\u201317}} \nAll of these chapels were likely peripheral to large temples hosting extensive cult activities,{{sfn|O'Connor|1992|pp=84, 87, 96}} for example that at Bubastis was peripheral to the main Old Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess [[Bastet]],{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} while that at Abydos was likely next to the  temple of Khenti-Amentiu.{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=19}}\n\nBeneath the floor of Hierakonpolis chapel, in an underground store, [[James Quibell]] uncovered a statue of king [[Khasekhemwy]] of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]], a terracota lion cub made during the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|Thinite era]],{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} a golden mask representing [[Horus]] and two copper statues.{{sfn|Muhly|1999|p=630}} These statues, originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base{{sfn|Muhly|1999|p=630}}{{sfn|Peck|1999|p=875}} had been  disassembled and placed inside one another then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I \"on the first day of the Heb Sed\" feast.{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} The two statues were symbolically \"trampling underfoot the [[Nine bows]]\"\u2014the ennemies of Egypt\u2014a stylized representation of Egypt's conquered foreign subjects.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}} While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved.{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre:{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} \"who was publicly associated as his father's successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Heb Sed feast]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.\"{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|pp=84\u201385}}\nAlternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed that the smaller statue may represent \"a more youthful Pepy I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies.\"{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=85}}\n\nIn addition to building chapels, Pepi also decreed a tax-exemption for the Ka chapel of his mother located in [[Qift|Koptos]].{{efn|group=note|The decree recording this, called decree Coptos Decree (a) in modern Egyptology, is now in the Egyptian Museum Cairo, catalog number 41890.{{sfn|Hayes|1946|p=4}}}}{{sfn|Hayes|1946|p=4}} A similar decree has survived on a stela discovered near the [[Bent Pyramid]] in [[Dashur]], whereby in his 21st year of reign, Pepi grants exemptions to the people serving in the two pyramids of [[Sneferu]]:{{sfn|Edwards|1999|p=253}}\n{{cquote|text=My majesty has commanded that these two pyramid towns be exempt for him throughout the course of eternity from doing any work of the palace, from doing any forced labor for any part of the royal residence throughout the course of eternity, or from doing any forced labor at the word of anybody in the course of eternity.{{sfn|Redford|1992|p=61}}}}\n\nAt the southern border of Egypt, in [[Elephantine]], several [[faience]] plaques bearing Pepi's cartouche{{sfn|Dreyer|1986|loc=no. 428\u2013447}} have been uncovered in the temple of [[Satet]].

This is also the case of the [[Abydos king list]], written under [[Seti I]] and which gives Pepi I's cartouche on the 36th entry, between those of Userkare and Merenre.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=27}}\n\nAn historical source against this order of succession is the ''Aegyptiaca'' (\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283 \u2013 246 BC) by [[Manetho]]. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]]. According to the Byzantine scholar [[George Syncellus]], Africanus wrote that the ''Aegyptiaca'' mentioned the succession \"Otho\u00eas \u2192 Phius \u2192 Methusuphis\" at the start of the Sixth Dynasty. Otho\u00eas, Phius (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03c6\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2), and Methusuphis are believed to be the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] forms for Teti, Pepi I and Merenre, respectively.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=53}} Manetho's reconstruction of the early Sixth Dynasty is in agreement with the [[Saqqara Tablet]], where Pepi's name is given on the 25th entry while Userkare is omitted.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=27}} This list was written under Ramses II.{{sfn|Daressy|1912|p=205}}\n\n===Length of Reign===\n[[Image:Offering vessel of Pepi I.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An offering vessel of Pepi I. It would have likely been used to celebrate this king's [[Heb Sed]] feast]]\nAn analysis of the [[South Saqqara Stone]] attests to a 25th [[cattle count]], its highest, during the reign of Pepi I. Evidence indicates that during the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre I Nemytemsaf the cattle count was conducted biennially, thus suggesting a regnal length of 49 years. However, a 50th year of reign cannot be discounted due to a missing fragment of the inscription following.{{sfn|Baud|Dobrev|1995|pp=46\u201349}} The [[Turin King List]] appears to list Pepi I with a reign of 20 years, while his successor Merenre I is accredited with a 44-year reign. This contradicts contemporaneous evidence from the stone whose highest attestation is the 5th cattle count. The Egyptologist [[Kim Ryholt]] suggests that the two entries might have been interchanged.{{sfn|Ryholt|1997|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThere has been some doubt regarding whether the cattle count dating system was strictly biennial or slightly more irregular. That the latter situation appeared to be the case was suggested by the \"Year after the 18th Count, 3rd Month of Shemu day 27\" inscription from Wadi Hammamat No. 74-75 which mentions the \"first occurrence of the Heb Sed\" in that year for Pepi.<ref>Anthony Spalinger, Dated Texts of the Old Kingdom, SAK 21: 1994, p.303</ref> as well as a \"Year after the 18th Count, 4th Month of Shemu day 5\" date in Sinai graffito No. 106 as the French Egyptologist [[Michel Baud]] noted in a 2006 book on Egyptian chronology.{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=148}} This would be the year 36 if the biennial dating system was used. This information is significant because the [[Heb Sed|Heb Sed Feast]] was always celebrated in a king's Year 30. If Pepi I was using a biennial counting system during his reign, these ''heb sed'' inscriptions should have been dated to the Year after the 15th Count instead. This could imply that the cattle count during the 6th dynasty was not regularly biennial. Michel Baud, however, stresses that the Year of the 18th count is preserved in the [[South Saqqara Stone]] and writes that:\n[[File:Pepi I.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Ointment vase celebrating Pepi I's first ''Sed'' festival, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].

It is hard to believe that such a narrow space corresponds to the jubilee celebration, which obviously had a considerable importance for this (and every) king.\"{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=150}}\n\nBaud notes that there was a tendency during this ruler's administration to mention the first jubilee repeatedly in the years following its celebration\u2014in connection with intense building activity at the king's funerary complex until even to the end of Pepi I's reign when this pharaoh's highest date\u2014the Year of the 25th Count, 1st Month of [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] day [lost]--from Hatnub Inscription No.3.<ref>Spalinger, p.304</ref> appears; this ruler's final 25th count is also strikingly associated with Pepi I's first royal jubilee.{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=150}} The South Saqqara Stone confirms that Pepi I's last year was his Year of the 25th Count.\n\nTherefore, the references to Pepi I's first jubilee being celebrated in his 18th cattle count are likely just part of this royal tendency to emphasize the king's first jubilee years after it was first celebrated and Michel Baud (and F. Raffaele) both note that the longest year compartment in the South Saqqara Stone appears \"at the beginning of register D. Fortuituously or not, this [year] compartment corresponds perfectly to year 30/31, if a strictly biennial system of numbering is presumed\" for Pepi I's reign.{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=150}} (i.e. his 15th count) Therefore, the count was mostly likely biennial during Pepi I's reign and the reference to his final year\u2014the 25 count\u2014implies that he reigned for 49 full years.\n\n== Pyramid complex ==\n{{main|Pyramid of Pepi I}}\n[[File:2009 1027 165328AA Petrie Museum, London.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fragments of the pyramid texts from Pepi I's pyramid in South Saqqara, now in the [[Petrie Museum]]]]\nPepi I had a pyramid built for himself in South Saqqara,{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=157}} which he named ''Men-nefer-Pepi'' variously translated as \"Pepi's splendor is enduring\",{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=351}} \"The perfection of Pepi is established\"{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=158}} \"The beauty of Pepi endures\",{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}}  and \"The perfection of Pepi endures\".{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=603}} The diminutive name ''Mennefer'' for the pyramid complex gave rise to a novel designation for the nearby capital of Egypt originally called ''Ineb-hedj'', designation which ultimately gave [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in Greek.{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}}{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=603}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}}\n\nPepi's main pyramid was constructed in the same fashion as others since [[Djedkare Isesi]]:{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=352}} a core built six steps high from small roughly dressed blocks of limestone bound together using clay mortar encased with fine limestone blocks.{{sfn|Verner|2001d|pp= 325 & 352\u2013353}} The pyramid, now destroyed, had a base length of {{convert|78.75|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}} converging to the apex at ~ 53\u00b0 and once stood {{convert|52.5|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}} tall.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=158}} Its remains now form a mound a meagre {{convert|12|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=351}}{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=157}} containing a pit in its centre dug by stone thieves.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nThe substructure of the pyramid was accessed from the north chapel which has since disappeared.

Pepi I was the son of his second predecessor [[Teti]], ascending the throne only after the brief and enigmatic reign of the shadowy [[Userkare]]. Pepi's mother was queen [[Iput]], who may have been a daughter of [[Unas]], final ruler of the [[Fifth Dynasty|Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]].\n\nPepi seems to have faced the decline of the pharaoh's power, which he tried to buttress by forming alliances with the provincial nomarch of Abydos, two daughters of whom became queens of Egypt. Pepi's first [[throne name]] was ''Neferdjahor'' which the king later altered to ''Meryre'' meaning \"beloved of [[R\u00ea]]\".{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}}\n\nPepi was succeeded by his son [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I]], who reigned only briefly. He was in turn succeeded by [[Pepi II]], who may have been another son of Pepi I by [[Ankhesenpepi II]], although he could instead be a grandson of Pepi I by Merenre I. Pepi II was the last great pharaoh of the Old Kingdom period.\n\n==Family==\n===Parents===\nPepi was the son of [[Teti]] and queen [[Iput]],{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=64 \u2013 65 & 76}} who may have been a daughter of [[Unas]] the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty.{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}} That Pepi was indeed a son of Iput is demonstrated by a relief on a decree uncovered in Koptos, which mentions Iput as Pepi's mother.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}}\n\n===Consorts===\n[[File:Queen_of_Pepy_II.jpg|thumb|upright|Ankhesenpepi II shown on a relief from her mortuary temple]]\nAt least eight consorts of Pepi I have been identified. These include [[Meritites IV]], [[Nubwenet]] and [[Inenek-Inti]], who are buried in pyramids adjacent to that of Pepi,{{sfn|Leclant|1999|p=866}} Mehaa, who is named in the tomb of her son Hornetjerkhet, and a queen named [[Nedjeftet]] who is mentioned on relief fragments.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=73}}. Pepi's most prominent wives were [[Ankhesenpepi I]] and [[Ankhesenpepi II]], both daughters of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife [[Nebet]].{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=73}} A final queen, named Weret-Yamtes,{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=83}} is known from the inscriptions uncovered in the tomb of Weni, an official serving Pepi. This queen apparently conspired against Pepi but was prosecuted when the conspiracy was discovered.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|pp=82\u201383}}\n\n===Children===\nPepi fathered at least three sons and a daughter. Ankhesenpepi I in all likelyhood bore him the future pharaoh [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I]]. In an alternative hypothesis, Hans Goedicke has proposed that Merenre's mother was the queen Were-Yamtes, responsible for the harem conspiracy against Pepi I. In this hypothesis, Ankhesenpepi I was claimed to be Merenre's mother to safeguard Merenre's claim to the throne.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Ankhesenpepi II was the mother of [[Pepi II Neferkare]],{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} who was likely born at the very end of his father's reign given that he was only 6 upon ascending the throne after Merenre's own reign.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Another son of Pepi with an as yet unidentified consort was Teti-ankh, meaning \"Teti lives\".{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} Teti-ankh is known only from an ink inscription bearing his name discovered in Pepi's pyramid.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=78}} Buried nearby is prince Hornetjerkhet, a son of Pepi with queen Mehaa.{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=76}} Pepi I's daughters include possibly [[Neith (wife of Pepi II)|Neith]] and [[Iput II]], both future wives of Pepi II.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E., 39.121.jpg|thumb|upright|Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, [[Brooklyn Museum]]{{efn|group=note|catalog number 39.121}}]]\n\n===Political situation===\n====Acending the throne====\nPepi's accession to the throne might have occurred in times of discord, as his father Teti is said by Manetho to have been assassinated by his own bodyguards.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=53}}{{sfn|Rice|1999|p=150}} [[Naguib Kanawati]] has argued in support of Manetho's claim, noting for example that Teti's reign saw an important increase in the number of guards at the Egyptian court, with these becoming responsible for the everyday care of the king.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=184}}\nAt the same time, the figures and names of several palace officials as represented in their tombs had been purposefully erased.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=173}} The attempted [[damnatio memoriae]] targeted three men in particular, the [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Heri, the overseer of weapons Mereri and chief physician Seankhuiptah who may therefore be behind the murder.{{sfn|Hubschmann|2011|p=2}}\n\nPepi was by then perhaps too young a child to reign. In any case, he did not immediately succeed his father who was rather succeeded by king [[Userkare]]. Userkare's identity and relation with the royal family remains uncertain. It is possible that he served only as a regent with Pepi's mother Iput as Pepi reached adulthood,{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=81}} or occupied the throne in the interregnum.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=191}}\nSuch hypotheses are supported by the apparent lack of resistance against Pepi ultimately taking the throne.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=81}} Against this view however, Kanawati has argued that Userkare's reign length\u2014at no more than five years\u2014is too short for a regency and that a regent would not have assumed a full royal titulary as Userkare did nor would he be included in king lists.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=184}} \n\nNonetheless, Pepi chose the Horus name of ''Mery-tawy'', meaning \"He who is loved by the two lands\", which Nicolas Grimal sees as an indication that he desired political appeasement.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=82}} Similarly, Pepi chose the throne name ''Nefersahor'', meaning \"Perfect is the protection of Horus\", which he only later changed to Meryre \"Beloved of Ra\".{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|p=104}} Although there seems not to be a direct relation between Userkare's brief reign and a later conspiracy in his harem, these events suggest some form of political instability at the time.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=82}}\n\n[[File:Cylinder Seal with the Name of Pepi I MET 17-5.jpg|thumb|upright|Turquoise cylinder seal of an official of Pepi I, \"Sole companion, lector priest, who does what is ordered [...] privy to the secret(s) of the king\"{{sfn|MET Cylinder|2020|loc=catalog number 17.5}}]]\n====Policies====\nIn a long trend that started earlier in the Fifth Dynasty, the Old Kingdom Egyptian state was the subject of increasing decentralization and regionalization. This process, well under way during Pepi I's reign, progressively weakened the king's primacy and ascendancy over his own administration and would ultimately result in the princedoms of the First Intermediate Period.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=16}} Pepi seems to have developed several policies to counteract this, notably with the constructions of royal Ka chapels throughout Egypt,{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=16}}{{sfn|Fischer|1958|pp=330\u2013333}} to strengthen the royal presence in the provinces.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|p=17}}\n\nLater in this reign, possibly around his 44th year on the throne,{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} Pepi faced a conspiracy hatched by one of his harem consort, Weret-Yamtes. Although the precise nature of her crime is not reported by Weni who served as a judge during the subsequent trial, this at least shows that the person of the king was not untouchable anymore.{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|p=105}} According to Hans Goedicke, Weret-Yamtes may have been the mother of Merenre,{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} while Nicolas Grimal sees this as highly unlikely, as Weret-Yamtes' son would have been punished together her.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|pp=82\u201383}} Perhaps in response to these events, late in his reign Pepi married two daughters of Khui, nomarch of Abydos.{{sfn|M\u00e1lek|2000a|pp=104\u2013105}} This may also have served to counteract the weakening of the king's authority over Middle and Upper Egypt by securing the allegiance of a powerful family.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=192}} The political importance of this marriage is demonstrated by the fact that, for the first and last time until the 26th Dynasty some 1800 years later,  Khui's wife [[Nebet]], a woman, was made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] of Upper Egypt.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=173}} Later, Khui's and Nebet's son [[Djau]] was made vizier as well. Pepi's marriages might be at the origin{{sfn|Yurco|1999|p=240}} of a trend, which continued during the later Sixth and [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasties]], in which the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]] in Koptos was the focus of much royal patronage.{{sfn|Goedicke|1955|p=183}} This is manifested by the [[Coptos Decrees]], which record successive pharaohs granting tax exemptions to the temple as well as official honors bestowed by the kings to the local ruling family while the Old Kingdom society was collapsing.{{sfn|Hayes|1946|pp=3\u201323}}\n\nThis part of Pepi's rule may not have been any less troubled than his early reign, as Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced yet another conspiracy against him, in which his vizier [[Rawer (vizier)|Rawer]] could have been involved. To support his theory, Kanawati observes that Rawer's image in his tomb has been desecrated, with his name, hands and feet chiselled off, while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepi's reign on stylistic grounds.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=177}} Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else designated heir to the throne at the expense of Merenre. Consequently to the failure of this conspiracy, Pepi I would have taken the drastic step of crowning Merenre during his own reign, thereby creating the earliest documented coregency of the history of Egypt.{{sfn|Kanawati|2003|p=177}} That such a coregency did indeed take place is indirectly supported by a gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as kings, an inscription mentioning king Merenre in Hatnub which suggests that he counted his years of reign starting at some point during his father's reign and the copper statues of Hierakonpolis, discussed below.{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=192}}\n\n====Building activities====\n[[File:Hidden treasures 09.jpg|thumb|upright|Smaller copper statue representing Merenre or a young Pepi I, from Hierakonpolis]]\nPepi I built extensively throughout Egypt, mostly devoting the building efforts to local cults{{sfn|Hayes|1978|p=126}} and royal Ka chapels.{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|pp=16\u201317}}\nIn [[Dendera]], where a fragmentary statue of a seated Pepi I has been uncovered,{{sfn|Daumas|1952|pp=163\u2013172}} Pepi I restored the [[Dendera Temple complex|temple complex]] to the goddess [[Hathor]].{{sfn|Cauville|1999|p=298}}\nIn Abydos,{{sfn|O'Connor|1999|p=110}} he built a small rock cut chapel dedicated to the local god [[Khenti-Amentiu]],{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=13}} where he is referred to as \"Pepi, Son of Hathor of Dendera\".{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=1}} \nIn the same locality Pepi might also have had a small [[Ancient_Egyptian_conception_of_the_soul#k\ua723_\"double\"|Ka]]-chapel built for himself.{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=17}}{{sfn|Kraemer|2017|p=20}} Such chapels comprised one or more chambers for the bringing of offerings dedicated to the cult of the Ka of a deceased or of the king.{{sfn|Bolshakov|2001|p=217}} \nLike his father Teti, Pepi had such a chapel built in [[Bubastis]],{{sfn|Lange|2016|p=121}} in the Nile Delta region, \nas well as another one built in [[Nekhen|Hierakonpolis]],{{sfn|O'Connor|1992|pp=91\u201392|loc=fig. 5A}}{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} in Upper Egypt and possibly also in [[Elkab]] where rock inscriptions refer to his funerary cult.{{sfn|Hendrickx|1999|p=344}} Further Ka chapels of Pepi have been found in Memphis, Zawyet el-Meytin, [[Assiut]] and [[Nagada]].{{sfn|Bussmann|2007|pp=16\u201317}} \nAll of these chapels were likely peripheral to large temples hosting extensive cult activities,{{sfn|O'Connor|1992|pp=84, 87, 96}} for example that at Bubastis was peripheral to the main Old Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess [[Bastet]],{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} while that at Abydos was likely next to the  temple of Khenti-Amentiu.{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=19}}\n\nBeneath the floor of Hierakonpolis chapel, in an underground store, [[James Quibell]] uncovered a statue of king [[Khasekhemwy]] of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]], a terracota lion cub made during the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|Thinite era]],{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} a golden mask representing [[Horus]] and two copper statues.{{sfn|Muhly|1999|p=630}} These statues, originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base{{sfn|Muhly|1999|p=630}}{{sfn|Peck|1999|p=875}} had been  disassembled and placed inside one another then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I \"on the first day of the Heb Sed\" feast.{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} The two statues were symbolically \"trampling underfoot the [[Nine bows]]\"\u2014the ennemies of Egypt\u2014a stylized representation of Egypt's conquered foreign subjects.{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}} While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved.{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=84}} The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre:{{sfn|Brovarski|1994|p=18}} \"who was publicly associated as his father's successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Heb Sed feast]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.\"{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|pp=84\u201385}}\nAlternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed that the smaller statue may represent \"a more youthful Pepy I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies.\"{{sfn|Bongioanni|Croce|2001|p=85}}\n\nIn addition to building chapels, Pepi also decreed a tax-exemption for the Ka chapel of his mother located in [[Qift|Koptos]].{{efn|group=note|The decree recording this, called decree Coptos Decree (a) in modern Egyptology, is now in the Egyptian Museum Cairo, catalog number 41890.{{sfn|Hayes|1946|p=4}}}}{{sfn|Hayes|1946|p=4}} A similar decree has survived on a stela discovered near the [[Bent Pyramid]] in [[Dashur]], whereby in his 21st year of reign, Pepi grants exemptions to the people serving in the two pyramids of [[Sneferu]]:{{sfn|Edwards|1999|p=253}}\n{{cquote|text=My majesty has commanded that these two pyramid towns be exempt for him throughout the course of eternity from doing any work of the palace, from doing any forced labor for any part of the royal residence throughout the course of eternity, or from doing any forced labor at the word of anybody in the course of eternity.{{sfn|Redford|1992|p=61}}}}\n\nAt the southern border of Egypt, in [[Elephantine]], several [[faience]] plaques bearing Pepi's cartouche{{sfn|Dreyer|1986|loc=no. 428\u2013447}} have been uncovered in the temple of [[Satet]].

This is also the case of the [[Abydos king list]], written under [[Seti I]] and which gives Pepi I's cartouche on the 36th entry, between those of Userkare and Merenre.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=27}}\n\nAn historical source against this order of succession is the ''Aegyptiaca'' (\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283 \u2013 246 BC) by [[Manetho]]. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius]].

Otho\u00eas, Phius (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03c6\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2), and Methusuphis are believed to be the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] forms for Teti, Pepi I and Merenre, respectively.{{sfn|Waddell|1971|p=53}} Manetho's reconstruction of the early Sixth Dynasty is in agreement with the [[Saqqara Tablet]], where Pepi's name is given on the 25th entry while Userkare is omitted.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=27}} This list was written under Ramses II.{{sfn|Daressy|1912|p=205}}\n\n===Length of Reign===\n[[Image:Offering vessel of Pepi I.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An offering vessel of Pepi I. It would have likely been used to celebrate this king's [[Heb Sed]] feast]]\nAn analysis of the [[South Saqqara Stone]] attests to a 25th [[cattle count]], its highest, during the reign of Pepi I. Evidence indicates that during the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre I Nemytemsaf the cattle count was conducted biennially, thus suggesting a regnal length of 49 years. However, a 50th year of reign cannot be discounted due to a missing fragment of the inscription following.{{sfn|Baud|Dobrev|1995|pp=46\u201349}} The [[Turin King List]] appears to list Pepi I with a reign of 20 years, while his successor Merenre I is accredited with a 44-year reign. This contradicts contemporaneous evidence from the stone whose highest attestation is the 5th cattle count. The Egyptologist [[Kim Ryholt]] suggests that the two entries might have been interchanged.{{sfn|Ryholt|1997|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThere has been some doubt regarding whether the cattle count dating system was strictly biennial or slightly more irregular. That the latter situation appeared to be the case was suggested by the \"Year after the 18th Count, 3rd Month of Shemu day 27\" inscription from Wadi Hammamat No. 74-75 which mentions the \"first occurrence of the Heb Sed\" in that year for Pepi.<ref>Anthony Spalinger, Dated Texts of the Old Kingdom, SAK 21: 1994, p.303</ref> as well as a \"Year after the 18th Count, 4th Month of Shemu day 5\" date in Sinai graffito No. 106 as the French Egyptologist [[Michel Baud]] noted in a 2006 book on Egyptian chronology.{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=148}} This would be the year 36 if the biennial dating system was used. This information is significant because the [[Heb Sed|Heb Sed Feast]] was always celebrated in a king's Year 30. If Pepi I was using a biennial counting system during his reign, these ''heb sed'' inscriptions should have been dated to the Year after the 15th Count instead. This could imply that the cattle count during the 6th dynasty was not regularly biennial. Michel Baud, however, stresses that the Year of the 18th count is preserved in the [[South Saqqara Stone]] and writes that:\n[[File:Pepi I.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Ointment vase celebrating Pepi I's first ''Sed'' festival, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].

Fortuituously or not, this [year] compartment corresponds perfectly to year 30/31, if a strictly biennial system of numbering is presumed\" for Pepi I's reign.{{sfn|Baud|2006|p=150}} (i.e. his 15th count) Therefore, the count was mostly likely biennial during Pepi I's reign and the reference to his final year\u2014the 25 count\u2014implies that he reigned for 49 full years.\n\n== Pyramid complex ==\n{{main|Pyramid of Pepi I}}\n[[File:2009 1027 165328AA Petrie Museum, London.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fragments of the pyramid texts from Pepi I's pyramid in South Saqqara, now in the [[Petrie Museum]]]]\nPepi I had a pyramid built for himself in South Saqqara,{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=157}} which he named ''Men-nefer-Pepi'' variously translated as \"Pepi's splendor is enduring\",{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=351}} \"The perfection of Pepi is established\"{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=158}} \"The beauty of Pepi endures\",{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}}  and \"The perfection of Pepi endures\".{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=603}} The diminutive name ''Mennefer'' for the pyramid complex gave rise to a novel designation for the nearby capital of Egypt originally called ''Ineb-hedj'', designation which ultimately gave [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in Greek.{{sfn|Verner|2001b|p=590}}{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|2001|p=603}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=84}}\n\nPepi's main pyramid was constructed in the same fashion as others since [[Djedkare Isesi]]:{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=352}} a core built six steps high from small roughly dressed blocks of limestone bound together using clay mortar encased with fine limestone blocks.{{sfn|Verner|2001d|pp= 325 & 352\u2013353}} The pyramid, now destroyed, had a base length of {{convert|78.75|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}} converging to the apex at ~ 53\u00b0 and once stood {{convert|52.5|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}} tall.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=158}} Its remains now form a mound a meagre {{convert|12|m|ft+royal cubit|0|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Verner|2001d|p=351}}{{sfn|Lehner|2008|p=157}} containing a pit in its centre dug by stone thieves.{{sfn|Lehner|2008|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nThe substructure of the pyramid was accessed from the north chapel which has since disappeared. From the entrance, a descending corridor gives way to a vestibule leading into the horizontal passage. Halfway along the passage three granite portcullises guard the chambers.
