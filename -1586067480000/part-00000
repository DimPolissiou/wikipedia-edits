Little is known about his life. He died shortly before his father and was never duke himself.\n\nThe name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and Cl\u00e9mence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from [[Besan\u00e7on]], Sainte-Etienne, naming  \"Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy) (possibly {{ill|Sibilla of Barcelona|ca|Sibil\u00b7la de Barcelona|gl|Sibila de Barcelona|it|Sibilla di Barcellona|pt|Sibila da Borgonha}}), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry.

Little is known about his life. He died shortly before his father and was never duke himself.\n\nThe name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and Cl\u00e9mence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from [[Besan\u00e7on]], Sainte-Etienne, naming  \"Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy) (possibly {{ill|Sibilla of Barcelona|ca|Sibil\u00b7la de Barcelona|gl|Sibila de Barcelona|it|Sibilla di Barcellona|pt|Sibila da Borgonha}}), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry.

In 1948, she was sold to [[Republic of China Navy|Taiwan]], where she served as ''Taihu (\u592a\u6e56)'' until 1972.\n\n==History==\n===United States Navy (1943-1948)===\nThe ship was named for [[George Breeman]], a Navy [[Sailor|seaman]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for extraordinary heroism during a [[turret]] explosion on [[USS Kearsarge (BB-5)|USS ''Kearsarge'' (BB-5)]].\n\n''Breeman'' (DE-104) was laid down on 20 March 1943 at the [[Dravo Corporation]] shipyard in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]; launched on 4 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie Breeman Schellgell, niece of the late Chief Turret Captain Breeman; completed at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]]; and commissioned there on 12 December 1943, with [[Lieutenant Commander]] Edward N. W. Hunter, [[USNR]], in command.\n\nThe [[destroyer escort]] spent the remainder of 1943 and the first week in 1944 outfitting at Norfolk.  On 11 January 1944, she embarked upon her shakedown cruise to the waters around [[Bermuda]].  She completed the training period on 1 February and returned to Norfolk on 5 February for post-shakedown repairs.  On 16 February, ''Breeman'' steamed out of [[Chesapeake Bay]] as an element of Escort Division (CortDiv) 48 which itself made up a part of the screen of Task Group (TG) 21.16, a hunter-killer group built around {{USS|Block Island|CVE-21|6}}.  After fueling off Fayal in the [[Azores]], the task group headed north to provide [[antisubmarine]] support for transatlantic [[convoy]]s.  Though ''Breeman'' appears to have taken no direct part in the attacks, the task group accounted for at least two [[U-boat]]s before entering [[Casablanca]] on 8 March.  The destroyer escort put to sea with the ''Block Island'' task group again on 12 March. On the 19th, planes from ''Block Island'' sank {{GS|U-1059}}, and ''Breeman'' assisted in the rescue of the U-boat's survivors.\n\n''Breeman'' and {{USS|Bronstein|DE-189|6}} parted company with TG&nbsp;21.16 on 23 March.  The following day, the two destroyer escorts put into [[Dakar]], [[French West Africa]], and began loading an unusual cargo \u2014 60 million dollars in [[gold]] belonging to the [[Bank of Poland]].  The two warships departed Dakar on 26 March and proceeded to New York by the most direct and safest route and arrived there on 3 April.  Following repairs, ''Breeman'' returned to sea on 12 April with another hunter-killer force which formed a portion of the screen for Convoy UGS-39.  She and her convoy entered [[Bizerte, Tunisia]], safely on 3 May.  On the return voyage, the destroyer escort helped to screen Convoy GUS 39, arriving in Norfolk on 29 May.  After an availability at the [[New York Navy Yard]], she spent nine days during mid-June engaged in training at [[Casco Bay, Maine]].\n\nOn 21 June, the destroyer escort headed south to the vicinity of Bermuda where she joined TG&nbsp;22.10\u2014another hunter-killer group built around [[USS Card (CVE-11)|''Card'' (CVE-11)]].  Once again, the task group attacked a number of [[sonar]] contacts and sank at least one U-boat.  ''Breeman'', however, shared none of the credit for the sinking.  The warship returned to New York late in August and, after repairs, conducted training at Casco Bay in early September.  On 18 September, she rejoined the ''Card'' task group near Bermuda for further training.  Soon thereafter, ''Breeman'' suffered [[propeller]] damage that forced her to return to the New York Navy Yard.  She completed repairs by 23 October, and put to sea that same day for torpedo training at the Submarine Base, [[New London, Connecticut]], and in Casco Bay.  On 24 November the destroyer escort and the rest of CortDiv 48 joined company with ''Card'' once again to form TG&nbsp;22.2.  For about a month, the warship trained in [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) tactics in the waters surrounding Bermuda.  She returned to New York on 29 December.\n\n''Breeman'' rejoined TG&nbsp;22.2 on 12 January 1945 to act as plane guard and escort during carrier qualifications off [[Quonset Point, Rhode Island]].  On 22 January, the destroyer escort and her colleagues of CortDiv 48 joined [[USS Bogue (CVE-9)|''Bogue'' (CVE-9)]] in shaping a course for Norfolk.  In late February and early March, ''Breeman'' returned to sea with a hunter-killer group built around ''Bogue'' for a fruitless search for German weather submarines purportedly operating to the south of [[Iceland]].  She and the rest of her task group entered New York on 17 March.  During the first part of April, the destroyer escort conducted training at New London as a unit of a hunter-killer group built around ''Card''.  Between 15 April and 5 May, that task group hunted for submarines off the Virginia capes.  Later, in May, ''Breeman'' moved north to Quonset Point where she served as a plane guard during carrier qualifications.\n\nIn mid-August, the warship joined [[USS Mission Bay (CVE-59)|''Mission Bay'' (CVE-59)]] in a voyage to [[Port Everglades, Florida]].  Once again plane guard operations occupied her time during the visit to the Florida coast.\n\nOn 2 October, however, she headed north once again.  At the New York Navy Yard, ''Breeman'' began the inactivation process.  That phase lasted until 13 November when she got underway for Florida again.  On 16 November, the destroyer escort arrived in [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]], to begin final preparations for decommissioning.

In 1948, she was sold to [[Republic of China Navy|Taiwan]], where she served as ''Taihu (\u592a\u6e56)'' until 1972.\n\n==History==\n===United States Navy (1943-1948)===\n The ship was named for [[George Breeman]], a Navy [[Sailor|seaman]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for extraordinary heroism during a [[turret]] explosion on [[USS Kearsarge (BB-5)|USS ''Kearsarge'' (BB-5)]].\n\n''Breeman'' (DE-104) was laid down on 20 March 1943 at the [[Dravo Corporation]] shipyard in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]; launched on 4 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie Breeman Schellgell, niece of the late Chief Turret Captain Breeman; completed at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]]; and commissioned there on 12 December 1943, with [[Lieutenant Commander]] Edward N. W. Hunter, [[USNR]], in command.\n\nThe [[destroyer escort]] spent the remainder of 1943 and the first week in 1944 outfitting at Norfolk.  On 11 January 1944, she embarked upon her shakedown cruise to the waters around [[Bermuda]].  She completed the training period on 1 February and returned to Norfolk on 5 February for post-shakedown repairs.  On 16 February, ''Breeman'' steamed out of [[Chesapeake Bay]] as an element of Escort Division (CortDiv) 48 which itself made up a part of the screen of Task Group (TG) 21.16, a hunter-killer group built around {{USS|Block Island|CVE-21|6}}.  After fueling off Fayal in the [[Azores]], the task group headed north to provide [[antisubmarine]] support for transatlantic [[convoy]]s.  Though ''Breeman'' appears to have taken no direct part in the attacks, the task group accounted for at least two [[U-boat]]s before entering [[Casablanca]] on 8 March.  The destroyer escort put to sea with the ''Block Island'' task group again on 12 March. On the 19th, planes from ''Block Island'' sank {{GS|U-1059}}, and ''Breeman'' assisted in the rescue of the U-boat's survivors.\n\n''Breeman'' and {{USS|Bronstein|DE-189|6}} parted company with TG&nbsp;21.16 on 23 March.  The following day, the two destroyer escorts put into [[Dakar]], [[French West Africa]], and began loading an unusual cargo \u2014 60 million dollars in [[gold]] belonging to the [[Bank of Poland]].  The two warships departed Dakar on 26 March and proceeded to New York by the most direct and safest route and arrived there on 3 April.  Following repairs, ''Breeman'' returned to sea on 12 April with another hunter-killer force which formed a portion of the screen for Convoy UGS-39.  She and her convoy entered [[Bizerte, Tunisia]], safely on 3 May.  On the return voyage, the destroyer escort helped to screen Convoy GUS 39, arriving in Norfolk on 29 May.  After an availability at the [[New York Navy Yard]], she spent nine days during mid-June engaged in training at [[Casco Bay, Maine]].\n\nOn 21 June, the destroyer escort headed south to the vicinity of Bermuda where she joined TG&nbsp;22.10\u2014another hunter-killer group built around [[USS Card (CVE-11)|''Card'' (CVE-11)]].  Once again, the task group attacked a number of [[sonar]] contacts and sank at least one U-boat.  ''Breeman'', however, shared none of the credit for the sinking.  The warship returned to New York late in August and, after repairs, conducted training at Casco Bay in early September.  On 18 September, she rejoined the ''Card'' task group near Bermuda for further training.  Soon thereafter, ''Breeman'' suffered [[propeller]] damage that forced her to return to the New York Navy Yard.  She completed repairs by 23 October, and put to sea that same day for torpedo training at the Submarine Base, [[New London, Connecticut]], and in Casco Bay.  On 24 November the destroyer escort and the rest of CortDiv 48 joined company with ''Card'' once again to form TG&nbsp;22.2.  For about a month, the warship trained in [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) tactics in the waters surrounding Bermuda.  She returned to New York on 29 December.\n\n''Breeman'' rejoined TG&nbsp;22.2 on 12 January 1945 to act as plane guard and escort during carrier qualifications off [[Quonset Point, Rhode Island]].  On 22 January, the destroyer escort and her colleagues of CortDiv 48 joined [[USS Bogue (CVE-9)|''Bogue'' (CVE-9)]] in shaping a course for Norfolk.  In late February and early March, ''Breeman'' returned to sea with a hunter-killer group built around ''Bogue'' for a fruitless search for German weather submarines purportedly operating to the south of [[Iceland]].  She and the rest of her task group entered New York on 17 March.  During the first part of April, the destroyer escort conducted training at New London as a unit of a hunter-killer group built around ''Card''.  Between 15 April and 5 May, that task group hunted for submarines off the Virginia capes.  Later, in May, ''Breeman'' moved north to Quonset Point where she served as a plane guard during carrier qualifications.\n\nIn mid-August, the warship joined [[USS Mission Bay (CVE-59)|''Mission Bay'' (CVE-59)]] in a voyage to [[Port Everglades, Florida]].  Once again plane guard operations occupied her time during the visit to the Florida coast.\n\nOn 2 October, however, she headed north once again.  At the New York Navy Yard, ''Breeman'' began the inactivation process.  That phase lasted until 13 November when she got underway for Florida again.  On 16 November, the destroyer escort arrived in [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]], to begin final preparations for decommissioning.  ''Breeman'' was decommissioned on 26 April 1946 and berthed with the Green Cove Springs Group, [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]].  \n\n===Republic of China Navy (1948-1972)===\nShe remained there until 29 October 1948 at which time she was transferred to the Nationalist Chinese government based on [[Taiwan]].

The creative team alleged that Disney had charged massive distribution fees as well as selling the repeats of the series into the New York market (where it aired on Fox O&O [[WNYW]]) for no money, undercutting the pot of net profits, upon which they asserted a 75 percent stake. Since its syndication run in 1995, Disney has generated $1.5 billion from the show alone. The plaintiffs also claimed that Disney applied 35 and 40 percent distribution fees when licensing the domestic basic cable rights of the series and questioned the royalties they were getting from subscription video-on-demand services including [[Hulu]] (which Disney had acquired a major stake and full control of back in May). Disney however contended that it was authorized to do so under the contracts.

The acquisitions of KCPQ/KZJO (the former of which Fox had sought to buy since 2014, under previous owner [[Tribune Media]]) and WITI give Fox O&Os in two additional [[National Football League|NFL]] markets with teams in the [[National Football Conference]], which the Fox network is under contract to televise games (the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]], of which Milwaukee is a secondary market), and would give Fox station properties in 14 of the top 15 [[media market]]s; it would also mark the return of WITI to the Fox fold, having previously been owned by the network from 1997 to 2007. In addition, the deal is seen as a move by Nexstar to clear space to allow it to exercise its purchase option for CW affiliate [[WPIX]]/[[New York City]], which, as part of Nexstar's purchase of Tribune, was spun off to the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] to address ownership cap issues related to WPIX's uncompliance with the UHF discount.\n|<ref>{{cite web|title=Nexstar, Fox Buy/Sell Five Stations|url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/top-news/240879/nexstar-fox-buy-sell-five-stations/|author=Mark K.

(Due to the eight-month window between production and broadcast, NBC would continue to air first-run episodes of ''Days'' through the summer of 2020 under its current backlog.) A renewal would result in Corday potentially offering its main cast reduced salaries to reduce production costs in negotiations for new contracts, a scenario which opens the possibility that some of the actors may not return if they do agree to the offers. Despite the unique circumstances, the unprecedented move sparked speculation of ''Days''{{'}} possible cancellation, leading some of the show's actors \u2013 including [[Kristian Alfonso]] ([[Hope Williams Brady]]/[[Gina Von Amberg]]), [[Chandler Massey]] ([[Will Horton]]), [[Camila Banus]] ([[Gabi Hernandez]]) and [[Freddie Smith]] ([[Sonny Kiriakis]]) \u2013 to assure fans and refute the cancellation rumors.

However, the universal symbol may have been inspired by similar existing recycling symbols, such as one featuring two arrows chasing each other in a circle that Volkswagen stamped in the early 1960s into some automobile parts it remanufactured{{citation_needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n==Variants==\nThe recycling symbol is in the [[public domain]], and is not a [[trademark]]. The Container Corporation of America originally applied for a trademark on the design, but the application was challenged, and the corporation decided to abandon the claim.<ref name=\"GaryFound\"/> As such, anyone may use or modify the recycling symbol, royalty-free.\n\nThough use of the symbol is regulated by law in some countries,<ref name=RulesLogo>{{cite web|title=Rules Governing Use of Recycling Logo|url=http://www.recyclingexpert.co.uk/rules-governing-use-recycling-logo.html|work=Recycling Expert [website]|publisher=recyclingexpert.co.uk|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>  countless variants of it exist worldwide. Anderson's original proposal had the arrows form a triangle standing on its tip\u2014upside down compared with the versions most commonly seen today\u2014but the CCA, in adopting Anderson's design, rotated it 60\u00b0 to stand on its base instead.<ref name=\"GaryFound\"/>\n\nBoth Anderson's proposal and CCA's designs form a M\u00f6bius strip with ''one'' half-twist by having two of the arrows fold over each other, and one fold under, thereby canceling out one of the other folds. However, most variants of the symbol used today have all the arrows folding over themselves, producing a M\u00f6bius strip with ''three'' half-twists. Existing single half-twist variants of the logo do not generally agree on which of the arrows is the one to fold underneath.

Their purpose is to assist recyclers with sorting the collected materials, but they do not necessarily mean that the product/packaging can be recycled either through domestic curbside collection or industrial collections.  The SPI symbols are loosely based on the M\u00f6bius loop symbol, but feature simpler bent (rather than folded over) arrows that can be embossed on plastic surfaces without loss of detail.  The arrows are formed into a flat, two-dimensional triangle rather than the pseudo-three-dimensional triangle used in the original recycling logo.\n\nThe different resin identification codes can be represented by [[Unicode]] icons <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2673</span> (U+2673), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2674</span> (U+2674), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2675</span> (U+2675), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2676</span> (U+2676), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2677</span> (U+2677), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2678</span> (U+2678), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2679</span> (U+2679), and <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u267a</span> (U+267A).\n\n[[Recycling codes]] extend these numbers above 7 to include various non-plastic materials, including metals, glass, paper, and batteries of various types.\n\n==Other variants==\n[[File:Recycle symbol Taiwan.svg|thumb|[[Taiwan]]'s recycling symbol features the use of [[negative space]] to also create arrows pointing outward]]\n\u267e, an [[infinity]] sign (\u221e) inside a circle, represents the '''permanent paper symbol''',  used in packaging and publishing to signify the use of durable [[acid-free paper]].   In some ways, this logo expresses the ''opposite'' intention from the recycle logo, in that the acid-free paper is intended to last indefinitely, rather than being recycled.  Nevertheless, acid-free paper does not usually contain toxic materials (although certain inks do), so it is easily recycled or composted.\n\nA satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling.  This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, \"THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY\", surrounding the modified logo.  The satirical logo appears in the 1998 catalog of an [[installation art]] work in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], in which the artist [[Steven Pippin]] modified a row of glass-doored washing machines in a [[laundromat]] to operate as giant cameras.

[[Container Corporation of America]], a large producer of recycled paperboard, sponsored a contest for art and design students at high schools and colleges across the country to raise awareness of environmental issues. It was won by [[Gary Anderson (designer)|Gary Anderson]], then a 23-year-old college student at the [[University of Southern California]], whose entry was the image now known as the universal recycling symbol.<ref name=GaryFound>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Penny|author2=Jerry Powell |title=Gary Anderson has been found!|journal=Resource Recycling: North America's Recycling and Composting Journal|date=May 1999|pages=pg.1\u20132|url=http://logoblink.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/recycling_symbol_garyanderson.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> The symbol is not [[trademark]]ed and is in the [[public domain]].<ref name=GaryFound/> The public-domain status of the symbol has been challenged, but this challenge was unsuccessful owing to the wide use of the symbol. However, the universal symbol may have been inspired by similar existing recycling symbols, such as one featuring two arrows chasing each other in a circle that Volkswagen stamped in the early 1960s into some automobile parts it remanufactured{{citation_needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n==Variants==\nThe recycling symbol is in the [[public domain]], and is not a [[trademark]]. The Container Corporation of America originally applied for a trademark on the design, but the application was challenged, and the corporation decided to abandon the claim.<ref name=\"GaryFound\"/> As such, anyone may use or modify the recycling symbol, royalty-free.\n\nThough use of the symbol is regulated by law in some countries,<ref name=RulesLogo>{{cite web|title=Rules Governing Use of Recycling Logo|url=http://www.recyclingexpert.co.uk/rules-governing-use-recycling-logo.html|work=Recycling Expert [website]|publisher=recyclingexpert.co.uk|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>  countless variants of it exist worldwide. Anderson's original proposal had the arrows form a triangle standing on its tip\u2014upside down compared with the versions most commonly seen today\u2014but the CCA, in adopting Anderson's design, rotated it 60\u00b0 to stand on its base instead.<ref name=\"GaryFound\"/>\n\nBoth Anderson's proposal and CCA's designs form a M\u00f6bius strip with ''one'' half-twist by having two of the arrows fold over each other, and one fold under, thereby canceling out one of the other folds. However, most variants of the symbol used today have all the arrows folding over themselves, producing a M\u00f6bius strip with ''three'' half-twists. Existing single half-twist variants of the logo do not generally agree on which of the arrows is the one to fold underneath.  The logo is usually displayed with the arrows circulating clockwise, but the underlying M\u00f6bius strip exists in two [[topology|topologically]] distinct mirror-image forms of opposite [[handedness]].\n\nThe [[American Paper Institute]] originally promoted four different variants of the recycling symbol for different purposes.

However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\n\nIn 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the [[Nanking decade]]. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of [[Zhejiang]] and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n[[File:Crossing river by Gate of China01.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese soldiers entering the walled city of Nanjing through the [[Gate of China, Nanjing|Gate of China]]]]\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\n\nIn 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (often considered a theater of [[World War II]]).<ref>Fu Jing-hui, An Introduction of Chinese and Foreign History of War, 2003, p.109\u2013111</ref> Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]] (the \"Rape of Nanking\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[John E.

In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"[[Wang Jingwei Government|Nanjing Regime]]\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by [[Wang Jingwei]] was established in Nanjing as a rival to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in Chongqing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Imperial Japan and national identities in Asia, 1895\u20131945 |year=2003 |first1=Li |first2=R.B. |last1=Narangoa |last2=Cribb |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-7007-1482-0 |page=13}}</ref> In 1946, after the [[Surrender of Japan]], the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n[[File:Hall of Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] is the tomb of [[Sun Yat-sen]], the first president of the [[Republic of China]]]]\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n{{see also|Yangtze River Crossing Campaign}} \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the [[Yangtze River]].

By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only [[Tibet (1912\u201351)|Tibet]] and [[Hainan Island]] were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a [[province-level municipality]], but it was soon merged into [[Jiangsu]] and again became the provincial capital by replacing [[Zhenjiang]] which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Nanjing Area - Lower Yangtse Valley & Eastern China Map.jpg|thumb|Nanjing Region \u2013 Lower Yangtze Basin and Eastern China.]]\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of {{convert|6598|km2|abbr=on}}, is situated in the heartland of the [[drainage area]] of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Luoyang]], {{convert|900|km|abbr=on}} south-southeast of Beijing, {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} west-northwest of Shanghai, and {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} east-northeast of [[Chongqing]].

The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\n\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|\u6e05\u4e7e\u9686\u3001\u5609\u6176\u5e74\u9593\uff0c\u6c5f\u5be7\u7e54\u6a5f\u5728\u56db\u842c\u53f0\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6e05\u5149\u7dd2\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u5341\u516d\u65e5\u300a\u7533\u5831\u300b\uff1a\"\uff08\u5357\u4eac\uff09\u57ce\u5ec2\u5167\u5916\u7dde\u6a5f\u7e3d\u6578\u5e38\u4e94\u842c\u6709\u5947\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u70ba\u751f\u7522\u8005\u9054\u4e8c\u5341\u842c\u4eba\u3002\"}}</ref> Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526}}) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as [[dragon robe]]s. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"{{lang|zh-hans|\u8d21\u7f0e}}\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02}}, the market sells [[wangjin]]), Guyilang ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4f30\u8863\u5eca}}, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6cb9\u574a\u6865}}, the bridge near an oil mill).\n\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing.

A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the [[service industry]], .\n\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=\u7efc\u8ff0|chapterurl=http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%975-7/html/5Noname002.html |script-title=zh:\u5357\u4eac\u5e02\u5fd7\uff08\u7b2c5\u5377\uff09\u00b7\u5de5\u4e1a}}</ref> Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the [[Reform and Opening]] recovering market economy, the [[state-owned enterprises]] found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or [[privatization]] and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Zifeng Tower 2017.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Nanjing Zifeng Tower]] and the [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain]] in the background]]\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past.

However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last emperor.

The following decade is known as the [[Nanking decade]]. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy.

Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\n\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth.

Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"{{lang|zh-hans|\u8d21\u7f0e}}\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court.

A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing.

In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the city was the official [[imperial examination]] center ([[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]) for the [[Jiangnan]] region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\n\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Pekinguniversitykunqu4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kunqu]]]]\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the [[Qianxian Dance Company]], [[Nanjing Dance Company]], [[Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute]] and [[Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company]] among others.\n\n[[Jiangsu Province Kun Opera]] is one of the best theaters for [[Kunqu]], China's oldest stage art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/zhuanti/153379.htm=|title=A brief introduction to Jiangsu Province Kunqu Theater}}</ref>\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe.
