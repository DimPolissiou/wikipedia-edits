Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and [[electric transmission line|transmission lines]], but most purchase power from an [[electric utility]]. The railway usually provides its own distribution lines, switches, and [[transformer]]s.\n\nPower is supplied to moving trains with a (nearly) continuous [[electrical conductor|conductor]] running along the track that usually takes one of two forms: an [[overhead line]], suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings, or a [[third rail]] mounted at track level and contacted by a sliding \"[[pickup shoe]]\". Both overhead wire and third-rail systems usually use the running rails as the return conductor, but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose.\n\nIn comparison to the principal alternative, the [[Diesel locomotive|diesel engine]], electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency, lower [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and lower operating costs.\nElectric locomotives are also usually quieter, more powerful, and more responsive and reliable than diesels.\nThey have no local emissions, an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas.\nSome electric traction systems provide [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] that turns the train's [[kinetic energy]] back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid.\nWhile diesel locomotives burn petroleum, electricity can be generated from diverse sources, including renewable energy.<ref name=PMKB72>P. M. Kalla-Bishop, ''Future Railways and Guided Transport'', IPC Transport Press Ltd. 1972, pp. 8-33</ref>\n\nDisadvantages of electric traction include: high [[capital cost]]s that may be uneconomic on lightly trafficked routes, a relative lack of flexibility (since electric trains need third rails or overhead wires), and a vulnerability to power interruptions.<ref name=PMKB72/> [[Electro-diesel locomotive]]s and [[Electro-diesel multiple unit]]s mitigate these problems somewhat as they are capable of running on diesel power during an outage or on non-electrified routes.\n\nDifferent regions may use different supply voltages and frequencies, complicating through service and requiring greater complexity of locomotive power.\nThe limited clearances available under overhead lines may preclude efficient [[Double-stack rail transport|double-stack container service]].<ref name=PMKB72/>\n\nRailway electrification has constantly increased in the past decades, and as of 2012, electrified tracks account for nearly one third of total tracks globally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Railway Handbook 2015|url=http://uic.org/IMG/pdf/iea-uic_2015-2.pdf|publisher=International Energy Agency|page=18|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Europe rail electrification en.svg|thumb|Electrification systems in Europe:\n{{legend|#cdcfd0|Non-electrified}}\n{{legend|#eea631|750&nbsp;V DC}}\n{{legend|#eda1a0|1.5&nbsp;kV DC}}\n{{legend|#f5f0bb|3&nbsp;kV DC}}\n{{legend|#a3a5ce|[[15&nbsp;kV AC]]}}\n{{legend|#94af2e|[[25&nbsp;kV AC]]}}\nHigh speed lines in France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey operate under 25&nbsp;kV, as do high power lines in the former Soviet Union as well.]]\n\nElectrification systems are classified by three main parameters:\n* [[Voltage]]\n* [[Electric current|Current]]\n** [[Direct current]] (DC)\n** [[Alternating current]] (AC)\n*** [[Frequency]]\n* Contact system\n** [[Third rail]]\n** [[Fourth rail]]\n** [[Overhead line]]s (catenary)\n*** Overhead lines plus [[linear motor]]\n\nSelection of an electrification system is based on economics of energy supply, maintenance, and capital cost compared to the revenue obtained for freight and passenger traffic. Different systems are used for urban and intercity areas; some [[electric locomotive]]s can switch to different supply [[voltage]]s to allow flexibility in operation.\n\n==={{Anchor|Voltage}}Standardised voltages===\nSix of the most commonly used voltages have been selected for European and international standardisation. Some of these are independent of the contact system used, so that, for example, 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC may be used with either third rail or overhead lines.\n\nThere are many other voltage systems used for railway electrification systems around the world, and the [[list of railway electrification systems]] covers both standard voltage and non-standard voltage systems.\n\nThe permissible range of voltages allowed for the standardised voltages is as stated in standards BS&nbsp;EN&nbsp;50163<ref>EN 50163: ''Railway applications.

In [[Slovakia]], there are two narrow-gauge lines in the High Tatras (one a [[Rack railway|cog railway]]). In the [[Netherlands]] it is used on the main system, alongside 25&nbsp;kV on the [[HSL-Zuid]] and [[Betuwelijn]], and 3000&nbsp;V south of [[Maastricht]]. In [[Portugal]], it is used in the [[Cascais Line]] and in [[Denmark]] on the suburban [[S-train]] system (1650&nbsp;V DC).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1,500&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC was used in 1954 for the [[Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway|Woodhead]] trans-Pennine route (now closed); the system used [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], allowing for transfer of energy between climbing and descending trains on the steep approaches to the tunnel. The system was also used for suburban electrification in [[East (London sub region)|East London]] and [[Manchester]], now converted to 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC. It is now only used for the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]. In India, 1,500&nbsp;V DC was the first electrification system launched in 1925 in Mumbai area. Between 2012 and 2016, the electrification was converted to {{25 kV 50 Hz}} which is the countrywide system.\n\n3&nbsp;kV DC is used in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, [[Slovakia]], Slovenia, South Africa, Chile, the northern portion of the Czech Republic, the former republics of the [[Soviet Union]], and the Netherlands. It was formerly used by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] from [[Harlowton, Montana]], to [[Seattle]], across the Continental Divide and including extensive branch and loop lines in Montana, and by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad]] (now [[New Jersey Transit]], converted to 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC) in the United States, and the [[Kolkata suburban railway]] (Bardhaman Main Line) in India, before it was converted to {{25 kV 50 Hz}}.\n\nDC voltages between 600&nbsp;V and 800&nbsp;V are used by most [[tram]]ways (streetcars), [[trolleybus]] networks and [[Rapid transit|underground]] (subway) systems.\n\n====Overhead systems with linear motor====\n''See [[Linear motor#Several subways in Japan and China|overhead systems with linear motor]]''\n\n===Third rail===\n{{Main|Third rail}}\n[[File:Derde rail.jpg|thumb|left|A bottom-contact third rail on the [[Amsterdam Metro]], Netherlands]]\n[[File:Top contact pickup shoe.jpg|thumb|With top-contact third (and fourth) rail a heavy [[Contact shoe|shoe]] attached to the underside of a [[wood]]en [[Beam (structure)|beam]] which in turn is attached to the bogie, collects power by sliding over the top surface of the conductor rail.]]\n\n[[File:Arcing pickup shoe.jpg|thumb|right|Arcs like this are normal and occur when the collection shoes of a train drawing power reach the end of a section of power rail.]]\nMost electrification systems use overhead wires, but third rail is an option up to 1,500&nbsp;V, as is the case with [[Line 3, Shenzhen Metro|Shenzhen Metro Line 3]]. Third rail systems exclusively use DC distribution. The use of AC is not feasible because the dimensions of a third rail are physically very large compared with the [[skin effect|skin depth]] that the alternating current penetrates to {{convert|0.3|mm|in|3|disp=or}} in a steel rail. This effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of DC.<ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 table 18-21. See also Gomez-Exposito p.424, Fig.3</ref> Third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels, an important factor for subway systems.\n\n===Fourth rail===\n[[File:EalingCommon3.jpg|thumb|left|[[London Underground]] track at [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]] on the [[District line]], showing the third and fourth rails beside and between the running rails]]\n[[File:Milan M1 train fourth-rail contact shoe.jpg|thumb|A train on Milan Metro's Line 1 showing the fourth-rail contact shoe.]]\nThe [[London Underground]] in England is one of the few networks that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that, on third rail and overhead networks, is provided by the running rails. On the London Underground, a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energized at {{val|+420|u=V}} DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at {{val|-210|u=V}} DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of {{val|630|u=V}} DC. The same system was used for [[Milan]]'s earliest underground line, [[Milan Metro]]'s [[Milan Metro Line 1|line 1]], whose more recent lines use an overhead catenary or a third rail.\n\nThe key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the [[earthing|earthed (grounded)]] running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically [[Ground (electricity)|bonded]] together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.\n\n=== Linear motor ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018|small=no}}\n{{Main|Linear motor|linear induction motor}}\n[[File:TTC UTDC ICTS Mark I 3012.jpg|thumb|An [[S-series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] northbound train at [[Lawrence East station]]. Note the [[Linear motor#Conventional rails|slab]] between the running rails.]]\n[[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] systems run on conventional metal rails and pull power from a [[third rail]], but are powered by a [[linear induction motor]] that provides traction by pulling on a \"[[Four rail system|fourth rail]]\" placed between the running rails.\nThe [[Vancouver SkyTrain]] is the largest such system in operation with just under 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of track along the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo]] and [[Millennium Line|Millennium]] lines.\n\nIn the case of [[Line 3 Scarborough|Scarborough Line 3]], the  third and fourth rails are outside the [[Track (rail transport)|track]] and the fifth rail is an aluminum slab between the running rails.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n=== Rubber-tyred systems ===\n[[Image:Atelier Fontenay - MP 05 - Bogie avant.jpg|thumb|The [[bogie]] of an [[MP 05]], showing the [[flange]]d steel wheel inside the [[rubber]]-[[Tire|tyred]] one, as well as the vertical [[contact shoe]] on top of the [[Rail profile|steel rail]]]]\n{{main|Rubber-tyred metro}}\n[[Image:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bogie]] from an [[MP 89]] [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] vehicle. The lateral [[contact shoe]] is located between the rubber tyres]]\nA few lines of the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] in France operate on a four-rail power system. The trains [[rubber-tyred metro|move on rubber tyres]] which roll on a pair of narrow [[roll way]]s made of steel and, in some places, of [[concrete]]. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two [[guide bar]]s provided outside the running '[[roll way]]s' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], so at least electrically it is a four-rail system. Each [[wheelset (rail transport)|wheel set]] of a powered [[bogie]] carries one [[traction motor]]. A side sliding (side running) [[contact shoe]] picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each [[Railroad car|wagon]], is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the [[Rail profile|running rails]]. This and all other [[rubber-tyred metro]]s that have a {{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}} [[Track (rail transport)|track]] between the [[roll way]]s operate in the same manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article398.html|title=[M\u00e9troPole] De la centrale \u00e9lectrique au rail de traction|date=10 August 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810033607/http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article398.html|archivedate=10 August 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infovisual.info/05/050_en.html|title=Truck (bogie) - Visual Dictionary|first=Bernard|last=Dery|website=www.infovisual.info}}</ref>\n\n==Alternating current==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Railway electrification system.jpg|thumb|Image of a sign for high voltage above a railway electrification system]]\nRailways and electrical utilities use AC for the same reason: to use [[transformer]]s, which require AC, to produce higher voltages.\nThe higher the voltage, the lower the current for the same power, which reduces line loss, thus allowing higher power to be delivered.\n\nBecause alternating current is used with high voltages, this method of electrification is only used on [[overhead line]]s, never on third rails. Inside the locomotive, a transformer steps the voltage down for use by the traction motors and auxiliary loads.\n\nAn early advantage of AC is that the power-wasting [[resistors]] used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the [[transformer]] can supply a range of voltages.\nSeparate low-voltage transformer windings supply lighting and the motors driving auxiliary machinery.\nMore recently, the development of very high power semiconductors has caused the classic DC motor to be largely replaced with the three-phase [[induction motor]] fed by a [[variable frequency drive]], a special [[inverter]] that varies both frequency and voltage to control motor speed.\nThese drives can run equally well on DC or AC of any frequency, and many modern electric locomotives are designed to handle different supply voltages and frequencies to simplify cross-border operation.\n\n=== Low-frequency alternating current ===\n[[File:SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 6-6.jpg|thumb|15&nbsp;kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz AC system used in Switzerland]]\nFive European countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, have standardized on 15&nbsp;kV {{frac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;Hz (the 50&nbsp;Hz mains frequency divided by three) single-phase AC. On 16&nbsp;October 1995, Germany, Austria and Switzerland changed from {{frac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;Hz to 16.7&nbsp;Hz which is no longer exactly one-third of the grid frequency. This solved overheating problems with the rotary converters used to generate some of this power from the grid supply.<ref>{{cite book | first=C. | last=Linder | title=Umstellung der Sollfrequenz im zentralen Bahnstromnetz von 16&nbsp;2/3&nbsp;Hz auf 16,70&nbsp;Hz |trans-title=Switching the frequency in train electric power supply network from 16&nbsp;2/3&nbsp;Hz to 16,70&nbsp;Hz | work=Elektrische Bahnen | issue=Book 12 | publisher=Oldenbourg-Industrieverlag |year=2002 | issn=0013-5437 | language=de}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] pioneered overhead electrification of its suburban lines in London, [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] to [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] being opened to traffic on 1&nbsp;December 1909.

[[Peckham Rye railway station|Peckham Rye]] to [[West Norwood railway station|West Norwood]] opened in June 1912. Further extensions were not made owing to the First World War.

It was announced in 1926 that all lines were to be converted to DC third rail and the last overhead electric service ran in September 1929.\n\n==Non-contact systems==\nIt is possible to supply power to an electric train by [[inductive coupling]]. This allows the use of a high-voltage, insulated, conductor rail. Such a system was patented in 1894 by [[Nikola Tesla]], {{US Patent|514972}}. It requires the use of high-frequency alternating current. Tesla did not specify a frequency but George Trinkaus<ref>Trinkaus, George, ''Tesla, the lost inventions, pp 28\u201329'', High Voltage Press, Portland, OR, 1988</ref> suggests that around 1,000&nbsp;Hz would be likely.\n\nInductive coupling is widely used in low-power applications, such as re-chargeable [[electric toothbrush]]es and more recently, mobile telephones and wearable computing devices ([[inductive charging]]).\n\n==Energy efficiency==\n===Electric versus diesel===\n[[File:Dartford Junction - geograph.org.uk - 198168.jpg|thumb|An early rail electrification substation at [[Dartford]]]]\n\nElectric trains need not carry the weight of [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime movers]], transmission and fuel. This is partly offset by the weight of electrical equipment.\n\n[[Regenerative braking]] returns power to the electrification system so that it may be used elsewhere, by other trains on the same system or returned to the general power grid. This is especially useful in mountainous areas where heavily loaded trains must descend long grades.\n\nCentral station electricity can often be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly the same in the nominal regime,<ref>It turns out that the efficiency of electricity generation by a modern diesel locomotive is roughly the same as the typical U.S. fossil-fuel power plant. The heat rate of central power plants in 2012 was about 9.5k BTU/kwh per the Monthly Energy Review of the U.S. Energy Information Administration which corresponds to an efficiency of 36%. Diesel motors for locomotives have an efficiency of about 40% (see [[Brake specific fuel consumption]], \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 p. 65 and \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 p.20.). But there are reductions needed in both efficiencies needed to make a comparison. First, one must degrade the efficiency of central power plants by the transmission losses to get the electricity to the locomotive. Another correction is due to the fact that efficiency for the Russian diesel is based on the lower heat of combustion of fuel while power plants in the U.S. use the higher heat of combustion (see [[Heat of combustion]]. Still another correction is that the diesel's reported efficiency neglects the fan energy used for engine cooling radiators. See \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 p. 65 and \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 p.20 (who estimates the on-board electricity generator as 96.5% efficient).

The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by [[regenerative braking]] and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.\n\nLarge [[fossil fuel]] power stations operate at high efficiency,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Ucilia |url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/ge-to-crank-up-gas-power-plants-like-jet-engines/ |title=Gigaom GE to Crank Up Gas Power Plants Like Jet Engines |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ge-flexibility.com/solutions/flexefficiency-50-combined-cycle-power-plant/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824224826/http://www.ge-flexibility.com/solutions/flexefficiency-50-combined-cycle-power-plant/index.html |date=24 August 2012 }}</ref> and can be used for [[district heating]] or to produce [[district cooling]], leading to a higher total efficiency.\n\n===AC versus DC for mainlines===\nThe majority of modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid that is delivered to a locomotive, and within the locomotive, [[Transformer|transformed]] and [[Rectifier|rectified]] to a lower DC voltage in preparation for use by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. The difference between AC and DC electrification systems lies in where the AC is converted to DC: at the substation or on the train. Energy efficiency and infrastructure costs determine which of these is used on a network, although this is often fixed due to pre-existing electrification systems. \n\nBoth the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors).<ref>See \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432 p.95+ Ch. 4: \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f; \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u0445\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\" (Losses and efficiency; heating and cooling of electrical machinery and transformers) magnetic losses pp.96-7, ohmic losses pp.97-9</ref>  Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1988 pp. 103-4, \u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1980 pp. 122-3</ref> However, the higher voltages used in many AC electrification systems reduces transmission losses over longer distances, allowing for fewer substations or more powerful locomotives to be used. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.\n\n==Comparison with diesel traction==\n[[File:Thomas Robert Way00.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lots Road Power Station]] in a poster from 1910. This private power station, used by [[London Underground]], gave London trains and trams a power supply independent from the main power network.]]\nElectric locomotives may easily be constructed with greater power output than most diesel locomotives. For passenger operation it is possible to provide enough power with diesel engines (see e.g. '[[ICE TD]]') but, at higher speeds, this proves costly and impractical. Therefore, almost all [[high speed train]]s are electric. The high power of electric locomotives also gives them the ability to pull freight at higher speed over gradients; in mixed traffic conditions this increases capacity when the time between trains can be decreased. The higher power of electric locomotives and an electrification can also be a cheaper alternative to a new and less steep railway if trains weights are to be increased on a system.\n\nOn the other hand, electrification may not be suitable for lines with low frequency of traffic, because lower running cost of trains may be outweighed by the high cost of the electrification infrastructure. Therefore, most long-distance lines in developing or sparsely populated countries are not electrified due to relatively low frequency of trains.\n\nMaintenance costs of the lines may be increased by electrification, but many systems claim lower costs due to reduced wear-and-tear from lighter rolling stock.<ref>[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/network/working%20group%204%20-%20electrification%20strategy/networkrus_electrification.pdf \"UK Network Rail electrification strategy report\"] Table 3.3, page 31. Retrieved on 4 May 2010</ref> There are some additional maintenance costs associated with the electrical equipment around the track, such as power sub-stations and the catenary wire itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.\n\n[[Network effect]]s are a large factor with electrification.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} If through traffic is to have any benefit, time-consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive [[electro-diesel locomotive|dual mode engines]] must be used. This is mostly an issue for long-distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the [[double-stack car]] also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.\n\nA problem specifically related to electrified lines are gaps in the electrification. Electric vehicles, especially locomotives, lose power when traversing gaps in the supply, such as phase change gaps in overhead systems, and gaps over points in third rail systems. These become a nuisance, if the locomotive stops with its collector on a dead gap, in which case there is no power to restart. Power gaps can be overcome by on-board batteries or motor-flywheel-generator systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nIn 2014, progress is being made in the use of large [[capacitor]]s to power electric vehicles between stations, and so avoid the need for overhead wires between those stations.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] Oct 2014.</ref>\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* No exposure to passengers to exhaust from the locomotive\n* Lower cost of building, running and maintaining locomotives and [[multiple unit]]s\n* Higher power-to-weight ratio (no onboard fuel tanks), resulting in\n** Fewer locomotives\n** Faster acceleration\n** Higher practical limit of power\n** Higher limit of speed\n* Less [[noise pollution]] (quieter operation)\n* Faster acceleration clears lines more quickly to run more trains on the track in urban rail uses\n* Reduced power loss at higher altitudes (for ''power loss'' see [[Diesel engine]])\n* Independence of running costs from fluctuating fuel prices\n* Service to underground stations where diesel trains cannot operate for safety reasons\n* Reduced environmental pollution, especially in highly populated urban areas, even if electricity is produced by fossil fuels\n* Easily accommodates kinetic energy brake reclaim using supercapacitors\n* More comfortable ride on multiple units as trains have no underfloor diesel engines\n* Somewhat higher energy efficiency <ref>Per [[Railway electrification in the Soviet Union#Energy-Efficiency]] it was claimed that after the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per ton-km than diesels. However, part of this savings may be due to less stopping of electrics to let opposing trains pass since diesels operated predominately on single-track lines, often with moderately heavy traffic.</ref> in part due to [[regenerative braking]] and less power lost when \"idling\"\n* More flexible primary energy source: can use coal, nuclear, hydro or wind as the primary energy source instead of oil\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\n\n[[File:Berwick-upon-Tweed MMB 14 Royal Border Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Border Bridge]] in [[England]], a [[protected monument]].

Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other [[Structure gauge|obstructions]] have to be altered for [[Engineering tolerance#Clearance (civil engineering|clearance]]. Another aspect that can raise the cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to [[railway signalling]] needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and [[track circuits]] from interference by traction current. Electrification may require line closures while the new equipment is being installed.\n* Appearance: the overhead line structures and cabling can have a significant landscape impact compared with a non-electrified or third rail electrified line that has only occasional signalling equipment above ground level.\n* Fragility and vulnerability: overhead electrification systems can suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or the effects of high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, ripping the wires from their supports. The damage is often not limited to the supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the conductor rail.<ref name=\"metoffice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/mos_news_spr2009.pdf |title=Committee Meeting - Royal Meteorological Society - Spring 2009 |publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]] (rmets.org) |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n* Theft: the high scrap value of copper and the unguarded, remote installations make overhead cables an attractive target for scrap metal thieves.<ref name=\"nrcable\">{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/cabletheft/ |title=Network Rail - Cable Theft |publisher=[[Network Rail]] (www.networkrail.co.uk) |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> Attempts at theft of live 25&nbsp;kV cables may end in the thief's death from electrocution.<ref name=\"itvcable\">{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/story/2012-06-27/police-probe-cable-theft-death-link/ |work=ITV News |title=Police probe cable theft death link |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> In the UK, cable theft is claimed to be one of the biggest sources of delay and disruption to train services \u2014 though this normally relates to signalling cable, which is equally problematic for diesel lines.<ref name=\"itvcable2\">{{Cite news |author=Sarah Saunders |work=ITV News |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2012-06-27/body-discovery-linked-to-rail-cables-theft/ |title=Body discovery linked to rail cables theft |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Birds may perch on parts with different charges, and animals may also touch the electrification system.

Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and [[electric transmission line|transmission lines]], but most purchase power from an [[electric utility]]. The railway usually provides its own distribution lines, switches, and [[transformer]]s.\n\nPower is supplied to moving trains with a (nearly) continuous [[electrical conductor|conductor]] running along the track that usually takes one of two forms: an [[overhead line]], suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings, or a [[third rail]] mounted at track level and contacted by a sliding \"[[pickup shoe]]\". Both overhead wire and third-rail systems usually use the running rails as the return conductor, but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose.\n\nIn comparison to the principal alternative, the [[Diesel locomotive|diesel engine]], electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency, lower [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and lower operating costs.\nElectric locomotives are also usually quieter, more powerful, and more responsive and reliable than diesels.\nThey have no local emissions, an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas.\nSome electric traction systems provide [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] that turns the train's [[kinetic energy]] back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid.\nWhile diesel locomotives burn petroleum, electricity can be generated from diverse sources, including renewable energy.<ref name=PMKB72>P. M. Kalla-Bishop, ''Future Railways and Guided Transport'', IPC Transport Press Ltd. 1972, pp. 8-33</ref>\n\nDisadvantages of electric traction include: high [[capital cost]]s that may be uneconomic on lightly trafficked routes, a relative lack of flexibility (since electric trains need third rails or overhead wires), and a vulnerability to power interruptions.<ref name=PMKB72/> [[Electro-diesel locomotive]]s and [[Electro-diesel multiple unit]]s mitigate these problems somewhat as they are capable of running on diesel power during an outage or on non-electrified routes.\n\nDifferent regions may use different supply voltages and frequencies, complicating through service and requiring greater complexity of locomotive power.\nThe limited clearances available under overhead lines may preclude efficient [[Double-stack rail transport|double-stack container service]].<ref name=PMKB72/>\n\nRailway electrification has constantly increased in the past decades, and as of 2012, electrified tracks account for nearly one third of total tracks globally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Railway Handbook 2015|url=http://uic.org/IMG/pdf/iea-uic_2015-2.pdf|publisher=International Energy Agency|page=18|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Europe rail electrification en.svg|thumb|Electrification systems in Europe:\n{{legend|#cdcfd0|Non-electrified}}\n{{legend|#eea631|750&nbsp;V DC}}\n{{legend|#eda1a0|1.5&nbsp;kV DC}}\n{{legend|#f5f0bb|3&nbsp;kV DC}}\n{{legend|#a3a5ce|[[15&nbsp;kV AC]]}}\n{{legend|#94af2e|[[25&nbsp;kV AC]]}}\nHigh speed lines in France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey operate under 25&nbsp;kV, as do high power lines in the former Soviet Union as well.]]\n\nElectrification systems are classified by three main parameters:\n* [[Voltage]]\n* [[Electric current|Current]]\n** [[Direct current]] (DC)\n** [[Alternating current]] (AC)\n*** [[Frequency]]\n* Contact system\n** [[Third rail]]\n** [[Fourth rail]]\n** [[Overhead line]]s (catenary)\n*** Overhead lines plus [[linear motor]]\n\nSelection of an electrification system is based on economics of energy supply, maintenance, and capital cost compared to the revenue obtained for freight and passenger traffic. Different systems are used for urban and intercity areas; some [[electric locomotive]]s can switch to different supply [[voltage]]s to allow flexibility in operation.\n\n==={{Anchor|Voltage}}Standardised voltages===\nSix of the most commonly used voltages have been selected for European and international standardisation. Some of these are independent of the contact system used, so that, for example, 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC may be used with either third rail or overhead lines.\n\nThere are many other voltage systems used for railway electrification systems around the world, and the [[list of railway electrification systems]] covers both standard voltage and non-standard voltage systems.\n\nThe permissible range of voltages allowed for the standardised voltages is as stated in standards BS&nbsp;EN&nbsp;50163<ref>EN 50163: ''Railway applications.

In [[Slovakia]], there are two narrow-gauge lines in the High Tatras (one a [[Rack railway|cog railway]]). In the [[Netherlands]] it is used on the main system, alongside 25&nbsp;kV on the [[HSL-Zuid]] and [[Betuwelijn]], and 3000&nbsp;V south of [[Maastricht]]. In [[Portugal]], it is used in the [[Cascais Line]] and in [[Denmark]] on the suburban [[S-train]] system (1650&nbsp;V DC).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1,500&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC was used in 1954 for the [[Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway|Woodhead]] trans-Pennine route (now closed); the system used [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], allowing for transfer of energy between climbing and descending trains on the steep approaches to the tunnel. The system was also used for suburban electrification in [[East (London sub region)|East London]] and [[Manchester]], now converted to 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC. It is now only used for the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]. In India, 1,500&nbsp;V DC was the first electrification system launched in 1925 in Mumbai area. Between 2012 and 2016, the electrification was converted to {{25 kV 50 Hz}} which is the countrywide system.\n\n3&nbsp;kV DC is used in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, [[Slovakia]], Slovenia, South Africa, Chile, the northern portion of the Czech Republic, the former republics of the [[Soviet Union]], and the Netherlands. It was formerly used by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] from [[Harlowton, Montana]], to [[Seattle]], across the Continental Divide and including extensive branch and loop lines in Montana, and by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad]] (now [[New Jersey Transit]], converted to 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC) in the United States, and the [[Kolkata suburban railway]] (Bardhaman Main Line) in India, before it was converted to {{25 kV 50 Hz}}.\n\nDC voltages between 600&nbsp;V and 800&nbsp;V are used by most [[tram]]ways (streetcars), [[trolleybus]] networks and [[Rapid transit|underground]] (subway) systems.\n\n====Overhead systems with linear motor====\n''See [[Linear motor#Several subways in Japan and China|overhead systems with linear motor]]''\n\n===Third rail===\n{{Main|Third rail}}\n[[File:Derde rail.jpg|thumb|left|A bottom-contact third rail on the [[Amsterdam Metro]], Netherlands]]\n[[File:Top contact pickup shoe.jpg|thumb|With top-contact third (and fourth) rail a heavy [[Contact shoe|shoe]] attached to the underside of a [[wood]]en [[Beam (structure)|beam]] which in turn is attached to the bogie, collects power by sliding over the top surface of the conductor rail.]]\n\n[[File:Arcing pickup shoe.jpg|thumb|right|Arcs like this are normal and occur when the collection shoes of a train drawing power reach the end of a section of power rail.]]\nMost electrification systems use overhead wires, but third rail is an option up to 1,500&nbsp;V, as is the case with [[Line 3, Shenzhen Metro|Shenzhen Metro Line 3]]. Third rail systems exclusively use DC distribution. The use of AC is not feasible because the dimensions of a third rail are physically very large compared with the [[skin effect|skin depth]] that the alternating current penetrates to {{convert|0.3|mm|in|3|disp=or}} in a steel rail. This effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of DC.<ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 table 18-21. See also Gomez-Exposito p.424, Fig.3</ref> Third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels, an important factor for subway systems.\n\n===Fourth rail===\n[[File:EalingCommon3.jpg|thumb|left|[[London Underground]] track at [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]] on the [[District line]], showing the third and fourth rails beside and between the running rails]]\n[[File:Milan M1 train fourth-rail contact shoe.jpg|thumb|A train on Milan Metro's Line 1 showing the fourth-rail contact shoe.]]\nThe [[London Underground]] in England is one of the few networks that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that, on third rail and overhead networks, is provided by the running rails. On the London Underground, a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energized at {{val|+420|u=V}} DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at {{val|-210|u=V}} DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of {{val|630|u=V}} DC. The same system was used for [[Milan]]'s earliest underground line, [[Milan Metro]]'s [[Milan Metro Line 1|line 1]], whose more recent lines use an overhead catenary or a third rail.\n\nThe key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the [[earthing|earthed (grounded)]] running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically [[Ground (electricity)|bonded]] together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.\n\n=== Linear motor ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018|small=no}}\n{{Main|Linear motor|linear induction motor}}\n[[File:TTC UTDC ICTS Mark I 3012.jpg|thumb|An [[S-series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] northbound train at [[Lawrence East station]].

The trains [[rubber-tyred metro|move on rubber tyres]] which roll on a pair of narrow [[roll way]]s made of steel and, in some places, of [[concrete]]. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two [[guide bar]]s provided outside the running '[[roll way]]s' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], so at least electrically it is a four-rail system. Each [[wheelset (rail transport)|wheel set]] of a powered [[bogie]] carries one [[traction motor]]. A side sliding (side running) [[contact shoe]] picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each [[Railroad car|wagon]], is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the [[Rail profile|running rails]].

Inside the locomotive, a transformer steps the voltage down for use by the traction motors and auxiliary loads.\n\nAn early advantage of AC is that the power-wasting [[resistors]] used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the [[transformer]] can supply a range of voltages.\nSeparate low-voltage transformer windings supply lighting and the motors driving auxiliary machinery.\nMore recently, the development of very high power semiconductors has caused the classic DC motor to be largely replaced with the three-phase [[induction motor]] fed by a [[variable frequency drive]], a special [[inverter]] that varies both frequency and voltage to control motor speed.\nThese drives can run equally well on DC or AC of any frequency, and many modern electric locomotives are designed to handle different supply voltages and frequencies to simplify cross-border operation.\n\n=== Low-frequency alternating current ===\n[[File:SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 6-6.jpg|thumb|15&nbsp;kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz AC system used in Switzerland]]\nFive European countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, have standardized on 15&nbsp;kV {{frac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;Hz (the 50&nbsp;Hz mains frequency divided by three) single-phase AC. On 16&nbsp;October 1995, Germany, Austria and Switzerland changed from {{frac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;Hz to 16.7&nbsp;Hz which is no longer exactly one-third of the grid frequency.

[[Peckham Rye railway station|Peckham Rye]] to [[West Norwood railway station|West Norwood]] opened in June 1912. Further extensions were not made owing to the First World War. Two lines opened in 1925 under the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] serving [[Coulsdon North railway station|Coulsdon North]] and [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton railway station]].<ref name=Emus>[http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/southern/southern1.htm History of Southern Electrification] Part 1</ref><ref name=Emus2>[http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/southern/southern2.htm History of Southern Electrification] Part 2</ref> The lines were electrified at 6.7&nbsp;kV 25&nbsp;Hz. It was announced in 1926 that all lines were to be converted to DC third rail and the last overhead electric service ran in September 1929.\n\n==Non-contact systems==\nIt is possible to supply power to an electric train by [[inductive coupling]]. This allows the use of a high-voltage, insulated, conductor rail. Such a system was patented in 1894 by [[Nikola Tesla]], {{US Patent|514972}}. It requires the use of high-frequency alternating current. Tesla did not specify a frequency but George Trinkaus<ref>Trinkaus, George, ''Tesla, the lost inventions, pp 28\u201329'', High Voltage Press, Portland, OR, 1988</ref> suggests that around 1,000&nbsp;Hz would be likely.\n\nInductive coupling is widely used in low-power applications, such as re-chargeable [[electric toothbrush]]es and more recently, mobile telephones and wearable computing devices ([[inductive charging]]).\n\n==Energy efficiency==\n===Electric versus diesel===\n[[File:Dartford Junction - geograph.org.uk - 198168.jpg|thumb|An early rail electrification substation at [[Dartford]]]]\n\nElectric trains need not carry the weight of [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime movers]], transmission and fuel. This is partly offset by the weight of electrical equipment.\n\n[[Regenerative braking]] returns power to the electrification system so that it may be used elsewhere, by other trains on the same system or returned to the general power grid. This is especially useful in mountainous areas where heavily loaded trains must descend long grades.\n\nCentral station electricity can often be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly the same in the nominal regime,<ref>It turns out that the efficiency of electricity generation by a modern diesel locomotive is roughly the same as the typical U.S. fossil-fuel power plant. The heat rate of central power plants in 2012 was about 9.5k BTU/kwh per the Monthly Energy Review of the U.S. Energy Information Administration which corresponds to an efficiency of 36%. Diesel motors for locomotives have an efficiency of about 40% (see [[Brake specific fuel consumption]], \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 p. 65 and \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 p.20.). But there are reductions needed in both efficiencies needed to make a comparison. First, one must degrade the efficiency of central power plants by the transmission losses to get the electricity to the locomotive. Another correction is due to the fact that efficiency for the Russian diesel is based on the lower heat of combustion of fuel while power plants in the U.S. use the higher heat of combustion (see [[Heat of combustion]]. Still another correction is that the diesel's reported efficiency neglects the fan energy used for engine cooling radiators. See \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 p. 65 and \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 p.20 (who estimates the on-board electricity generator as 96.5% efficient).

The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by [[regenerative braking]] and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.\n\nLarge [[fossil fuel]] power stations operate at high efficiency,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Ucilia |url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/ge-to-crank-up-gas-power-plants-like-jet-engines/ |title=Gigaom GE to Crank Up Gas Power Plants Like Jet Engines |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ge-flexibility.com/solutions/flexefficiency-50-combined-cycle-power-plant/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824224826/http://www.ge-flexibility.com/solutions/flexefficiency-50-combined-cycle-power-plant/index.html |date=24 August 2012 }}</ref> and can be used for [[district heating]] or to produce [[district cooling]], leading to a higher total efficiency.\n\n===AC versus DC for mainlines===\nThe majority of modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid that is delivered to a locomotive, and within the locomotive, [[Transformer|transformed]] and [[Rectifier|rectified]] to a lower DC voltage in preparation for use by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. The difference between AC and DC electrification systems lies in where the AC is converted to DC: at the substation or on the train. Energy efficiency and infrastructure costs determine which of these is used on a network, although this is often fixed due to pre-existing electrification systems. \n\nBoth the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors).<ref>See \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432 p.95+ Ch. 4: \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f; \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u0445\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\" (Losses and efficiency; heating and cooling of electrical machinery and transformers) magnetic losses pp.96-7, ohmic losses pp.97-9</ref>  Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher.<ref>\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1988 pp. 103-4, \u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 1980 pp. 122-3</ref> However, the higher voltages used in many AC electrification systems reduces transmission losses over longer distances, allowing for fewer substations or more powerful locomotives to be used. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.\n\n==Comparison with diesel traction==\n[[File:Thomas Robert Way00.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lots Road Power Station]] in a poster from 1910. This private power station, used by [[London Underground]], gave London trains and trams a power supply independent from the main power network.]]\nElectric locomotives may easily be constructed with greater power output than most diesel locomotives. For passenger operation it is possible to provide enough power with diesel engines (see e.g. '[[ICE TD]]') but, at higher speeds, this proves costly and impractical. Therefore, almost all [[high speed train]]s are electric. The high power of electric locomotives also gives them the ability to pull freight at higher speed over gradients; in mixed traffic conditions this increases capacity when the time between trains can be decreased. The higher power of electric locomotives and an electrification can also be a cheaper alternative to a new and less steep railway if trains weights are to be increased on a system.\n\nOn the other hand, electrification may not be suitable for lines with low frequency of traffic, because lower running cost of trains may be outweighed by the high cost of the electrification infrastructure. Therefore, most long-distance lines in developing or sparsely populated countries are not electrified due to relatively low frequency of trains.\n\nMaintenance costs of the lines may be increased by electrification, but many systems claim lower costs due to reduced wear-and-tear from lighter rolling stock.<ref>[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/rus%20documents/route%20utilisation%20strategies/network/working%20group%204%20-%20electrification%20strategy/networkrus_electrification.pdf \"UK Network Rail electrification strategy report\"] Table 3.3, page 31. Retrieved on 4 May 2010</ref> There are some additional maintenance costs associated with the electrical equipment around the track, such as power sub-stations and the catenary wire itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.\n\n[[Network effect]]s are a large factor with electrification.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} If through traffic is to have any benefit, time-consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive [[electro-diesel locomotive|dual mode engines]] must be used. This is mostly an issue for long-distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the [[double-stack car]] also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.\n\nA problem specifically related to electrified lines are gaps in the electrification. Electric vehicles, especially locomotives, lose power when traversing gaps in the supply, such as phase change gaps in overhead systems, and gaps over points in third rail systems. These become a nuisance, if the locomotive stops with its collector on a dead gap, in which case there is no power to restart. Power gaps can be overcome by on-board batteries or motor-flywheel-generator systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nIn 2014, progress is being made in the use of large [[capacitor]]s to power electric vehicles between stations, and so avoid the need for overhead wires between those stations.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] Oct 2014.</ref>\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* No exposure to passengers to exhaust from the locomotive\n* Lower cost of building, running and maintaining locomotives and [[multiple unit]]s\n* Higher power-to-weight ratio (no onboard fuel tanks), resulting in\n** Fewer locomotives\n** Faster acceleration\n** Higher practical limit of power\n** Higher limit of speed\n* Less [[noise pollution]] (quieter operation)\n* Faster acceleration clears lines more quickly to run more trains on the track in urban rail uses\n* Reduced power loss at higher altitudes (for ''power loss'' see [[Diesel engine]])\n* Independence of running costs from fluctuating fuel prices\n* Service to underground stations where diesel trains cannot operate for safety reasons\n* Reduced environmental pollution, especially in highly populated urban areas, even if electricity is produced by fossil fuels\n* Easily accommodates kinetic energy brake reclaim using supercapacitors\n* More comfortable ride on multiple units as trains have no underfloor diesel engines\n* Somewhat higher energy efficiency <ref>Per [[Railway electrification in the Soviet Union#Energy-Efficiency]] it was claimed that after the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per ton-km than diesels.

Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other [[Structure gauge|obstructions]] have to be altered for [[Engineering tolerance#Clearance (civil engineering|clearance]]. Another aspect that can raise the cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to [[railway signalling]] needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and [[track circuits]] from interference by traction current. Electrification may require line closures while the new equipment is being installed.\n* Appearance: the overhead line structures and cabling can have a significant landscape impact compared with a non-electrified or third rail electrified line that has only occasional signalling equipment above ground level.\n* Fragility and vulnerability: overhead electrification systems can suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or the effects of high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, ripping the wires from their supports. The damage is often not limited to the supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the conductor rail.<ref name=\"metoffice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/mos_news_spr2009.pdf |title=Committee Meeting - Royal Meteorological Society - Spring 2009 |publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]] (rmets.org) |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n* Theft: the high scrap value of copper and the unguarded, remote installations make overhead cables an attractive target for scrap metal thieves.<ref name=\"nrcable\">{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/cabletheft/ |title=Network Rail - Cable Theft |publisher=[[Network Rail]] (www.networkrail.co.uk) |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> Attempts at theft of live 25&nbsp;kV cables may end in the thief's death from electrocution.<ref name=\"itvcable\">{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/story/2012-06-27/police-probe-cable-theft-death-link/ |work=ITV News |title=Police probe cable theft death link |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> In the UK, cable theft is claimed to be one of the biggest sources of delay and disruption to train services \u2014 though this normally relates to signalling cable, which is equally problematic for diesel lines.<ref name=\"itvcable2\">{{Cite news |author=Sarah Saunders |work=ITV News |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2012-06-27/body-discovery-linked-to-rail-cables-theft/ |title=Body discovery linked to rail cables theft |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Birds may perch on parts with different charges, and animals may also touch the electrification system.

Under these conditions, copper participates in the so-called [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton-type reaction]] \u2014 a chemical reaction causing oxidative damage to cells.\n*Excess copper causes a decline in the membrane integrity of microbes, leading to leakage of specific essential cell nutrients, such as [[potassium]] and [[glutamate]]. This leads to [[desiccation]] and subsequent cell death.\n*While copper is needed for many protein functions, in an excess situation (as on a copper alloy surface), copper binds to proteins that do not require copper for their function. This \"inappropriate\" binding leads to loss-of-function of the protein, and/or breakdown of the protein into nonfunctional portions.\n\nThese potential mechanisms, as well as others, are the subject of continuing study by academic research laboratories around the world.\n\n==Antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloy touch surfaces==\n{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\nCopper alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of [[microorganism]]s.

Under these conditions, copper participates in the so-called [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton-type reaction]] \u2014 a chemical reaction causing oxidative damage to cells.\n*Excess copper causes a decline in the membrane integrity of microbes, leading to leakage of specific essential cell nutrients, such as [[potassium]] and [[glutamate]]. This leads to [[desiccation]] and subsequent cell death.\n*While copper is needed for many protein functions, in an excess situation (as on a copper alloy surface), copper binds to proteins that do not require copper for their function. This \"inappropriate\" binding leads to loss-of-function of the protein, and/or breakdown of the protein into nonfunctional portions.\n\nThese potential mechanisms, as well as others, are the subject of continuing study by academic research laboratories around the world.\n\n==Antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloy touch surfaces==\n{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\nCopper alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of [[microorganism]]s.

The ''Reich'' became understood as deriving its authority and sovereignty entirely from a continuing unitary German [[Germans|\"national people\"]]; with that authority and sovereignty being exercised at any one time over a unitary German [[Germany|\"state territory\"]] with variable boundaries and extent. Although commonly translated as \"German Empire\", the word ''Reich'' here better translates as \"realm\" or territorial \"reach,\" in that the term does not in itself have monarchical connotations. The word ''Kaiserreich'' is applied to denote an empire with an [[emperor]]; hence the [[German Empire]] of 1871\u20131918 is termed ''Deutsches Kaiserreich'' in standard works of reference.<ref name=HM>''Harper's magazine, Volume 63''. Pp. 593. Nevertheless the official name of the German Empire remained as ''Deutsches Reich'' because the constitutional position of the head of state was officially a \"[[presidency]]\" of a [[confederation]] of German states led by the [[King of Prussia]] who would assume \"the title of German Emperor\" as referring to the [[German people]], but was not emperor of Germany as in an emperor of a state.</ref> From 1943 to 1945, the official name of Germany became \u2013 but was not formally proclaimed \u2013 '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (\"Greater German Reich\") on account of the additional German peoples and associated territories annexed into the state's administration before and during the [[Second World War]].\n\nTo refer to the entire period 1871\u20131945, the partially translated \"'''German Reich'''\" ({{IPAc-en|-|\u02c8|r|a\u026a|k}}) is applied by historians in formal contexts,<ref name=\"EB\"/> although in common English usage this state was and is known simply as '''Germany''', the English term \"German Empire\" being reserved to denote the German state between 1871 and 1918.\n\nThe history of the nation-state known as the German ''Reich'' is commonly divided into three periods:\n* [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n* [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933)\n* [[Nazi Germany]] (1933\u20131945)\n\nThe Nazi regime was sometimes contemporaneously called the \"Third Reich\" in common language, counting the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the first and the 1871 German Empire as the second, and ignoring the Weimar Republic, but the use of this term is mostly retrospective.\n\nThe [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] asserted, following its establishment in 1949, that within its boundaries it was the sole legal continuation of the German Reich; and consequently not a successor state.  Nevertheless, the Federal Republic did not maintain the specific title 'German Reich'; and so consistently replaced the prefix ''\"Reichs..\" '' in all official titles and designations with ''\"Bundes..\"''. Hence, the ''[[Chancellor of Germany|Reichskanzler]]'' became the ''[[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013present)|Bundeskanzler]]''.  Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the expanded Federal Republic describes itself as 'United Germany'; emphasising that Germany does not now recognise any territories outside its united boundaries, but ever included in the former German Reich, as having a valid claim to be a part of Germany as a whole.\n\n==Term==\nThe name ''Deutsches Reich'' was occasionally applied in contemporary maps to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (911\u20131806), also called \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" from the 16th century onwards, though it constituted a supranational entity extending beyond the frontiers of the German language area (''[[Sprachraum]]''). The first attempt to establish a \"German Empire\" during the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] by the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] ultimately failed: it was aborted by the monarchs of the [[German Confederation]], especially by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|King of Prussia]], fighting [[German nationalism]], which then was tied to the idea of [[popular sovereignty]].\n\nFollowing the ''[[Anschluss]]'' annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] in 1938, Nazi Germany informally named itself the '''Greater German''' '''''Reich''''' ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich}}). This name was made the official state name only during the last two years (1943\u201345) of Nazi rule under [[Adolf Hitler]],<ref>Decree RK 7669 E of the ''Reichsminister'' and head of the ''Reich'' chancellery [[Hans Lammers]], 26 June 1943.</ref> although the change was never proclaimed. After [[World War II]], the denotation \"German ''Reich''\" quickly fell into disuse in [[Allied-occupied Germany]], however, and the state's continued existence remained a matter of debate; the post-war [[West Germany|Bonn Republic]] maintained the continued existence of the German ''Reich'' as an 'overall state\", but dormant while East and West Germany continued to be divided. Nevertheless, when Germany was reunited in 1990 the term \"German ''Reich''\" was not revived as a title for the [[History of Germany since 1990|Berlin Republic]].\n\n==The difference between \"Reich\" and \"Empire\"==\n[[File:Deutsches Kaiserreich 1893.jpg|thumb|''Deutsches Reich'', 1893 map]]\n{{see also|Reich}}\n\nThe German word ''Reich'' translates to the English word \"empire\" (it also translates to such words as \"realm\" or \"domain\"). However, this translation was not used throughout the full existence of the German Reich. Historically, only Germany from 1871 to 1918 \u2014 when Germany was under the rule of an emperor (''Kaiser'') \u2014 is known in English as the \"German Empire\" (''Deutsches Kaiserreich'' in German historiography), while the term \"German Reich\" describes Germany from 1871 to 1945.<ref name=\"EB\">\"Germany\" in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> As the literal translation \"German Empire\" denotes a monarchy, the term is used only in reference to Germany before the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|fall of the monarchy]] at the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. \n\nAfter the [[Unification of Germany]], under the reign of the Prussian king [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and his Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the historic German states (''e.g.'' [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]) were united with [[Prussia]] under imperial rule, by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]]. On 18 January 1871, Wilhelm I was proclaimed \"German Emperor\" at the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in [[Versailles]], the German Reich was officially declared ''Deutsches Reich'', or \"German Empire\",<ref name=\"1910collision\">{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/collisions1910.html |title=Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with respect to Collisions between Vessels |date=23 September 1910 |location=Brussels}} \u2014 an example of a legal document in which Germany is officially referred to as \"the German Empire\"</ref> explicitly referring back to the extinct [[Holy Roman Empire]].  The title \"German Emperor\" was a compromise; Wilhelm I had wanted the title of \"Emperor of Germany\", but Bismarck refused this, so as to avoid implying a claim to extended monarchical authority over non-Prussian German kingdoms. On 14 April 1871, the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] parliament passed the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] (''Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches''), which was published two days later.\n\nHowever, originating from the [[North German Confederation]], the Empire never comprised all \"German\" lands; as it excluded [[Luxembourg]], and those [[Cisleithania]]n crown lands of [[Austria-Hungary]] which had been part of the former [[German Confederation]] until 1865. Moreover, it included the whole of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Prussia (region)|eastern parts of which]] had never been included in historic German lands. The unification under Prussian leadership manifested Bismarck's \"Lesser German\" solution of the [[German question]] after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, realised with the support of his [[National liberalism|national liberal]] allies. On the other hand, the German Reich of 1871 comprised extended Prussian territories with large non-German sections of the population, like [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Province of West Prussia|West Prussia]] or [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]], and also territories with predominantly German populations which had never been constitutionally \"German\", such as [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]].\n\nBismarck was otherwise unable, however, to avoid the term ''German Reich'' acquiring connotations from the English term \"empire\" or the Dutch term \"rijk\"; especially in emulation of late 19th century [[Imperialism]], as exemplified by the [[British Empire]], the [[Dutch Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire]]. Although a latecomer (and against Bismarck's pleading), the [[German colonial empire|German Empire]] established colonies in modern [[Togo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Namibia]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Polynesia]]; with an extensive naval capability to support these.  At the same time strong [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] political forces emerged, pressing for the borders of the ''Reich'' to be extended into a German-led central European multi-ethnic empire, emulating and rivalling [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] to the east.        \n\nBefore and during the events of [[World War I]], the German state was called an \"empire\" in English and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] was titled \"His Imperial and Royal Majesty the German Emperor.\"  After the War and the abolition of the monarchy during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], however, when Wilhelm was forced to abdicate, the official English name for Germany was the \"German Reich\":  ''Reich'' was left untranslated and no longer referred to an \"empire\" but, instead, took on the connotation of \"Realm\" or \"State\".  \"German Reich\" was used in legal documents and English-language international treaties \u2014 for example, the [[Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm |title=Full text of the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact |date=27 August 1928 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201753/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}</ref> and the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1931/7.html |title=Full text of the Geneva Convention |date=27 July 1929}}</ref>  \n\nApart from official documents, post-World War I Germany was referred to as the \"German Reich\" \u2014 never as the \"German Empire\" \u2014 for example, by British politicians<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/bluebook/blbk09.htm |title=Speech by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain |date=17 March 1939 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016032222/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/bluebook/blbk09.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 }}</ref>\u2014and the word \"Reich\" was used untranslated by Allied prosecutors throughout the [[Nuremberg Trials]], with \"German Empire\" only used to describe Germany before it became a federal republic in 1918.\n\n==Reich as \"national people\" versus Reich as \"state territory\"==\nAt the 1871 Unification of Germany (aside from Austria), the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the 'German Reich' was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 14}}</ref> This geographical understanding of the Reich became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of the German Reich as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and drawing on the rhetoric of \"the sovereignty of the nation\" in the [[Frankfurt Constitution]]<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 16}}</ref>\u2014albeit that many ethnic \"[[Germans]]\" (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871 and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as [[Province of Posen|Posen]]) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the [[Weimar Constitution|constitution of the Weimar Republic]],<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 17}}</ref> where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people, while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution's adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of Reich and people ran both ways\u2014not only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people, so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 88}}</ref> Subsequently the term \"German Reich\" continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also with the state territory; but increasingly, the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 33}}</ref> Following the Second World War, the term \"German Reich\" fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term \"nation as a whole\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term \"Germany as a whole\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory.\n\n==Nazi perspective on the Weimar Republic==\n\nThe [[Weimar Republic|1918\u20131933 republic]], which was also called German Reich, was ignored and denounced by the Nazis as a historical aberration. The name \"Weimar Republic\" was first used in 1929 after Hitler referred to the period as the \"''Republik von Weimar''\" (Republic of Weimar) at a rally in Munich with the term later becoming mainstream during the 1930s both within and outside Germany.<ref name=EvMaSchnurr>{{cite magazine|author=Eva-Maria Schnurr|title=Der Name des Feindes: Warum hei\u00dft die erste deutsche Demokratie eigentlich \"Weimarer Republik?\"|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|volume=5/2014|edition=Der Spiegel - Geschichte 3 Hausmitteilung 137 Impressum|page=20|date=September 2014}}</ref> The Nazis also contemptuously referred to it as \"[[The System (Nazism)|the System]]\".<ref name=\"berning\">Cornelia Schmitz-Berning: ''Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus.'' 2. durchges. u. \u00fcberarb, Aufl.

The Allies refused to recognise [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' or to recognise the legitimacy of his [[Flensburg Government]] (so-called because it was based at [[Flensburg]] and controlled only a small area around the town) and, on 5 June 1945, the four powers signed the ''[[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]]'' and assumed ''de jure'' supreme authority with respect to Germany.<ref>''[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/ger01.htm Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218151523/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/ger01.htm |date=2007-02-18 }}'', 5 June 1945</ref> The declaration asserted the complete legal extinction of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] following death of [[Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945, but the continued subsequent existence of a German people and a German national territory; although subject to the four signatory powers also asserting their authority to determine the future boundaries of Germany.\n\nAt the [[Potsdam Conference]],  [[Allied-occupied Germany]] was defined as comprising \"Germany as a whole\"; and was divided into [[British occupation zone|British]], [[French occupation zone|French]], [[American occupation zone|American]] and [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet]] occupation zones; while the Allied Powers exercised the state authority assumed by the Berlin Declaration in transferring the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories of the German Reich]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] to the [[Polish People's Republic|Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Divided Germany==\nIn 1973, in a review of the previous year's [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty between East and West Germany]], the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') ruled that according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] the German ''Reich'' had outlasted the collapse in 1945, and hence had continued to exist as an \u201coverall state\u201d, albeit one not itself capable of action. The court ruled that since 1949 the Federal Republic (FRG) had been partially identical with the German ''Reich'' and not merely its [[succession of states|successor]].<ref>BVerfGE 36, 1: Verdict of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') regarding the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|East\u2013West Basic Treaty]] \u2014 [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html#Rn078 in German] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807001034/http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html#Rn078 |date=2007-08-07 }} and [https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589 in English], 31 July 1973</ref> The court further elaborated that the 'partial identity' of the FRG was limited to apply only within its current ''de facto'' territory; and hence the Federal Republic could not claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for the territory of the ''Reich'' then under the ''de facto'' government of the German Democratic Republic; \"identity does not require exclusivity\". This was explained as being because the German Democratic Republic was beyond FRG authority and because the Allied powers still had jurisdiction where \"Germany as a whole\" was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court insisted that within the territory of the Federal Republic, the GDR could only be considered as one ''de jure'' German state amongst others, on the analogy of the pre-existing ''de jure'' German states that in 1949 had come together as the Federal Republic; and hence, like them, could never be accorded by the organs of the Federal Republic full recognition as a state in international law; even though the Federal Constitutional Court recognised that, within international law, the GDR was indeed an independent sovereign state.  The constitutional status of the GDR under the Basic Law still differed from that of the ''[[L\u00e4nder]]'' of the Federal Republic, in that the GDR had not declared its accession to the Basic Law; but the Constitutional Court maintained that the Basic Treaty was consistent with the GDR declaring its accession at some time in the future in accordance with its own constitution; and hence the Court determined that in recognising the GDR as a ''de jure'' German State, the Basic Treaty could be interpreted as facilitating the reunification of the German ''Reich'' (as indeed it eventually did). So long as any ''de jure'' German state remained separated from the rest, the German ''Reich'' could continue to exist only in suspension; but should the GDR be reunited with the Federal Republic, the ''Reich'' would once more be fully capable of action as a sovereign state. \n\n:\"In Article 6 the Contracting Parties agree that they shall base themselves on the principle that the sovereign power of each of the two States be confined to its State territory and that they will respect the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs. This agreement too is compatible with the Basic Law only if interpreted to the effect that for the Federal Republic of Germany the basis of this Treaty is the continued existence of Germany, which has according to the Basic Law to be recognized as a State (albeit not organized and therefore not capable of action), and that accordingly the mutual restriction of sovereign power to the territory of the State and respect for the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs has its reference to the special situation in which both States find themselves vis-\u00e0-vis each other as sub-States of Germany as a whole.\"\n\nAfter 1973, however, the claimed identity of the Federal Republic with the German ''Reich'' was not recognised by most other countries of the world. The Soviet Union, the three Western allies, and most other Western countries regarded the German ''Reich'' as still being one nation \u2014 not synonymous with either the West or East German state but rather the two states in collective. Other countries tended to regard the German ''Reich'' as having been divided into two distinct states in international law, and accordingly accorded both states full diplomatic recognition. As of 1974, East Germany's official stance was that the GDR was a new state that is German in nature, a successor of the German Empire,<ref>Donald M. McRae, ''Canadian Yearbook of International Law 2005'', Vol. 43, University of British Columbia, Vancouver 2006, p. 431.</ref> and that there were then two German states that were different nations.\n\n==Reunified Germany==\nWhen the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] between Germany and the wartime Allies was signed on 12 September 1990, there was no mention of the term ''Deutsches Reich'', however the Allies paraphrased the international legal personality of Germany as \"Germany as a whole\" in the English version of the text. Instead the [[states of Germany|states of the Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]], FRG) and the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]], GDR) agreed to be bound by certain conditions which they had to ratify, one of which was the recognising the reunification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin as constituting the full achievement of a united Germany. On meeting these conditions under Article 7.2 \"The United Germany [has] accordingly full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.\"<ref>[http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany], U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany. Updated: November 2003</ref>\n\nUnder Article 1 of the Treaty on Final Settlement, the new united Germany committed itself to renouncing any further territorial claims beyond the boundaries of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; \"The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other states and shall not assert any in the future.\"  Furthermore the Basic Law of the Federal Republic was required to be amended to state explicitly that full German unification had now been achieved, such that the new German state comprised the entirety of Germany, and that all constitutional mechanisms should be removed by which any territories outside those boundaries could otherwise subsequently be admitted; these amendments being bound by treaty not to be revoked.  Article 23 of the Basic Law was repealed, closing off the possibility for any further states to apply for membership of the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic comprised the entirety of the German people; \"This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect\".  This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; \"Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.\" In place of the former Article 23 under which the former GDR had declared its accession to the Federal Republic, a new Article 23 embedded the accession of the Federal Republic to the European Union within the Basic Law; hence with the subsequent accession of Poland to the EU, the constitutional bar on pursuing any claim to territories beyond the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] was reinforced.  In so far as the German Reich may be claimed to continue in existence as 'Germany as a whole', the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] in Poland or Russia, and the western territories, such as the eastern cantons or Elsass-Lothringen, are now definitively and permanently excluded from ever again being united within this Reich under the Basic Law.\n\nHence, although the GDR had by the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic, initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law required by the Treaty of Final Settlement) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.  Hence, although the GDR had nominally declared its accession the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the Treaty of Final Settlement.  These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic 'German Reich', specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer's declaration of accession.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[National colours of Germany]]\n* [[Germany (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Greater Germanic Reich]], a conceptual entity that the Nazis planned to establish during World War II.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|German Empire}}\n*[http://www.geschichte-on-demand.de/index.html Administrative history of the German Reich] {{in lang|de}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/GermanReichMapOfStates1913DeutschesReichStaatenkarte1913atlasFr German Reich map of states 1913 (300 dpi)]\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:German nationalism]]\n[[Category:German Empire]]\n[[Category:Weimar Republic]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:German ''Reich''}}\n{{History of Germany}}\n\n'''''Deutsches Reich''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283\u0259s \u02c8\u0281a\u026a\u00e7|lang}}) was the constitutional name in the [[German language]] for the German [[nation state]] that existed from 1871 to 1945. The ''Reich'' became understood as deriving its authority and sovereignty entirely from a continuing unitary German [[Germans|\"national people\"]]; with that authority and sovereignty being exercised at any one time over a unitary German [[Germany|\"state territory\"]] with variable boundaries and extent. Although commonly translated as \"German Empire\", the word ''Reich'' here better translates as \"realm\" or territorial \"reach,\" in that the term does not in itself have monarchical connotations. The word ''Kaiserreich'' is applied to denote an empire with an [[emperor]]; hence the [[German Empire]] of 1871\u20131918 is termed ''Deutsches Kaiserreich'' in standard works of reference.<ref name=HM>''Harper's magazine, Volume 63''. Pp. 593. Nevertheless the official name of the German Empire remained as ''Deutsches Reich'' because the constitutional position of the head of state was officially a \"[[presidency]]\" of a [[confederation]] of German states led by the [[King of Prussia]] who would assume \"the title of German Emperor\" as referring to the [[German people]], but was not emperor of Germany as in an emperor of a state.</ref> From 1943 to 1945, the official name of Germany became \u2013 but was not formally proclaimed \u2013 '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (\"Greater German Reich\") on account of the additional German peoples and associated territories annexed into the state's administration before and during the [[Second World War]].\n\nTo refer to the entire period 1871\u20131945, the partially translated \"'''German Reich'''\" ({{IPAc-en|-|\u02c8|r|a\u026a|k}}) is applied by historians in formal contexts,<ref name=\"EB\"/> although, in common English usage, this state was and is known simply as '''Germany''', the English term \"German Empire\" being reserved to denote the German state between 1871 and 1918.\n\nThe history of the nation-state known as the German ''Reich'' is commonly divided into three periods:\n* [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918)\n* [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933)\n* [[Nazi Germany]] (1933\u20131945)\n\nThe Nazi regime was sometimes contemporaneously called the \"Third Reich\" in common language, counting the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the first and the 1871 German Empire as the second, and ignoring the Weimar Republic, but the use of this term is mostly retrospective.\n\nThe [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] asserted, following its establishment in 1949, that within its boundaries it was the sole legal continuation of the German Reich; and consequently not a successor state.  Nevertheless, the Federal Republic did not maintain the specific title 'German Reich'; and so consistently replaced the prefix ''\"Reichs..\" '' in all official titles and designations with ''\"Bundes..\"''. Hence, the ''[[Chancellor of Germany|Reichskanzler]]'' became the ''[[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013present)|Bundeskanzler]]''.  Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the expanded Federal Republic describes itself as 'United Germany'; emphasising that Germany does not now recognise any territories outside its united boundaries, but ever included in the former German Reich, as having a valid claim to be a part of Germany as a whole.\n\n==Term==\nThe name ''Deutsches Reich'' was occasionally applied in contemporary maps to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (911\u20131806), also called \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" from the 16th century onwards, though it constituted a supranational entity extending beyond the frontiers of the German language area (''[[Sprachraum]]''). The first attempt to establish a \"German Empire\" during the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] by the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] ultimately failed: it was aborted by the monarchs of the [[German Confederation]], especially by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|King of Prussia]], fighting [[German nationalism]], which then was tied to the idea of [[popular sovereignty]].\n\nFollowing the ''[[Anschluss]]'' annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] in 1938, Nazi Germany informally named itself the '''Greater German''' '''''Reich''''' ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich}}). This name was made the official state name only during the last two years (1943\u201345) of Nazi rule under [[Adolf Hitler]],<ref>Decree RK 7669 E of the ''Reichsminister'' and head of the ''Reich'' chancellery [[Hans Lammers]], 26 June 1943.</ref> although the change was never proclaimed. After [[World War II]], the denotation \"German ''Reich''\" quickly fell into disuse in [[Allied-occupied Germany]], however, and the state's continued existence remained a matter of debate; the post-war [[West Germany|Bonn Republic]] maintained the continued existence of the German ''Reich'' as an 'overall state\", but dormant while East and West Germany continued to be divided. Nevertheless, when Germany was reunited in 1990 the term \"German ''Reich''\" was not revived as a title for the [[History of Germany since 1990|Berlin Republic]].\n\n==The difference between \"Reich\" and \"Empire\"==\n[[File:Deutsches Kaiserreich 1893.jpg|thumb|''Deutsches Reich'', 1893 map]]\n{{see also|Reich}}\n\nThe German word ''Reich'' translates to the English word \"empire\" (it also translates to such words as \"realm\" or \"domain\"). However, this translation was not used throughout the full existence of the German Reich. Historically, only Germany from 1871 to 1918 \u2014 when Germany was under the rule of an emperor (''Kaiser'') \u2014 is known in English as the \"German Empire\" (''Deutsches Kaiserreich'' in German historiography), while the term \"German Reich\" describes Germany from 1871 to 1945.<ref name=\"EB\">\"Germany\" in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> As the literal translation \"German Empire\" denotes a monarchy, the term is used only in reference to Germany before the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|fall of the monarchy]] at the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. \n\nAfter the [[Unification of Germany]], under the reign of the Prussian king [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and his Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the historic German states (''e.g.'' [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]) were united with [[Prussia]] under imperial rule, by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]]. On 18 January 1871, Wilhelm I was proclaimed \"German Emperor\" at the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in [[Versailles]], the German Reich was officially declared ''Deutsches Reich'', or \"German Empire\",<ref name=\"1910collision\">{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/collisions1910.html |title=Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with respect to Collisions between Vessels |date=23 September 1910 |location=Brussels}} \u2014 an example of a legal document in which Germany is officially referred to as \"the German Empire\"</ref> explicitly referring back to the extinct [[Holy Roman Empire]].  The title \"German Emperor\" was a compromise; Wilhelm I had wanted the title of \"Emperor of Germany\", but Bismarck refused this, so as to avoid implying a claim to extended monarchical authority over non-Prussian German kingdoms. On 14 April 1871, the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] parliament passed the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] (''Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches''), which was published two days later.\n\nHowever, originating from the [[North German Confederation]], the Empire never comprised all \"German\" lands; as it excluded [[Luxembourg]], and those [[Cisleithania]]n crown lands of [[Austria-Hungary]] which had been part of the former [[German Confederation]] until 1865. Moreover, it included the whole of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Prussia (region)|eastern parts of which]] had never been included in historic German lands. The unification under Prussian leadership manifested Bismarck's \"Lesser German\" solution of the [[German question]] after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, realised with the support of his [[National liberalism|national liberal]] allies. On the other hand, the German Reich of 1871 comprised extended Prussian territories with large non-German sections of the population, like [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Province of West Prussia|West Prussia]] or [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]], and also territories with predominantly German populations which had never been constitutionally \"German\", such as [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]].\n\nBismarck was otherwise unable, however, to avoid the term ''German Reich'' acquiring connotations from the English term \"empire\" or the Dutch term \"rijk\"; especially in emulation of late 19th century [[Imperialism]], as exemplified by the [[British Empire]], the [[Dutch Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire]]. Although a latecomer (and against Bismarck's pleading), the [[German colonial empire|German Empire]] established colonies in modern [[Togo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Namibia]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Polynesia]]; with an extensive naval capability to support these.  At the same time strong [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] political forces emerged, pressing for the borders of the ''Reich'' to be extended into a German-led central European multi-ethnic empire, emulating and rivalling [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] to the east.        \n\nBefore and during the events of [[World War I]], the German state was called an \"empire\" in English and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] was titled \"His Imperial and Royal Majesty the German Emperor.\"  After the War and the abolition of the monarchy during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], however, when Wilhelm was forced to abdicate, the official English name for Germany was the \"German Reich\":  ''Reich'' was left untranslated and no longer referred to an \"empire\" but, instead, took on the connotation of \"Realm\" or \"State\".  \"German Reich\" was used in legal documents and English-language international treaties \u2014 for example, the [[Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm |title=Full text of the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact |date=27 August 1928 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201753/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}</ref> and the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1931/7.html |title=Full text of the Geneva Convention |date=27 July 1929}}</ref>  \n\nApart from official documents, post-World War I Germany was referred to as the \"German Reich\" \u2014 never as the \"German Empire\" \u2014 for example, by British politicians<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/bluebook/blbk09.htm |title=Speech by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain |date=17 March 1939 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016032222/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/bluebook/blbk09.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 }}</ref>\u2014and the word \"Reich\" was used untranslated by Allied prosecutors throughout the [[Nuremberg Trials]], with \"German Empire\" only used to describe Germany before it became a federal republic in 1918.\n\n==Reich as \"national people\" versus Reich as \"state territory\"==\nAt the 1871 Unification of Germany (aside from Austria), the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the 'German Reich' was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 14}}</ref> This geographical understanding of the Reich became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of the German Reich as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and drawing on the rhetoric of \"the sovereignty of the nation\" in the [[Frankfurt Constitution]]<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 16}}</ref>\u2014albeit that many ethnic \"[[Germans]]\" (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871 and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as [[Province of Posen|Posen]]) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the [[Weimar Constitution|constitution of the Weimar Republic]],<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 17}}</ref> where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people, while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution's adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of Reich and people ran both ways\u2014not only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people, so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 88}}</ref> Subsequently the term \"German Reich\" continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also with the state territory; but increasingly, the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary.<ref>{{citation|first=Werner |last=Heun|title=The Constitution of Germany|date=2011 |publisher=Hart|pages= 33}}</ref> Following the Second World War, the term \"German Reich\" fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term \"nation as a whole\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term \"Germany as a whole\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory.\n\n==Nazi perspective on the Weimar Republic==\n\nThe [[Weimar Republic|1918\u20131933 republic]], which was also called German Reich, was ignored and denounced by the Nazis as a historical aberration. The name \"Weimar Republic\" was first used in 1929 after Hitler referred to the period as the \"''Republik von Weimar''\" (Republic of Weimar) at a rally in Munich with the term later becoming mainstream during the 1930s both within and outside Germany.<ref name=EvMaSchnurr>{{cite magazine|author=Eva-Maria Schnurr|title=Der Name des Feindes: Warum hei\u00dft die erste deutsche Demokratie eigentlich \"Weimarer Republik?\"|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|volume=5/2014|edition=Der Spiegel - Geschichte 3 Hausmitteilung 137 Impressum|page=20|date=September 2014}}</ref> The Nazis also contemptuously referred to it as \"[[The System (Nazism)|the System]]\".<ref name=\"berning\">Cornelia Schmitz-Berning: ''Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus.'' 2. durchges. u. \u00fcberarb, Aufl.

The Allies refused to recognise [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' or to recognise the legitimacy of his [[Flensburg Government]] (so-called because it was based at [[Flensburg]] and controlled only a small area around the town) and, on 5 June 1945, the four powers signed the ''[[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]]'' and assumed ''de jure'' supreme authority with respect to Germany.<ref>''[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/ger01.htm Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218151523/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/ger01.htm |date=2007-02-18 }}'', 5 June 1945</ref> The declaration asserted the complete legal extinction of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] following death of [[Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945, but the continued subsequent existence of a German people and a German national territory; although subject to the four signatory powers also asserting their authority to determine the future boundaries of Germany.\n\nAt the [[Potsdam Conference]],  [[Allied-occupied Germany]] was defined as comprising \"Germany as a whole\"; and was divided into [[British occupation zone|British]], [[French occupation zone|French]], [[American occupation zone|American]] and [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet]] occupation zones; while the Allied Powers exercised the state authority assumed by the Berlin Declaration in transferring the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories of the German Reich]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] to the [[Polish People's Republic|Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Divided Germany==\nIn 1973, in a review of the previous year's [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty between East and West Germany]], the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') ruled that according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] the German ''Reich'' had outlasted the collapse in 1945, and hence had continued to exist as an \u201coverall state\u201d, albeit one not itself capable of action. The court ruled that since 1949 the Federal Republic (FRG) had been partially identical with the German ''Reich'' and not merely its [[succession of states|successor]].<ref>BVerfGE 36, 1: Verdict of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') regarding the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|East\u2013West Basic Treaty]] \u2014 [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html#Rn078 in German] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807001034/http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/dfr/bv036001.html#Rn078 |date=2007-08-07 }} and [https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589 in English], 31 July 1973</ref> The court further elaborated that the 'partial identity' of the FRG was limited to apply only within its current ''de facto'' territory; and hence the Federal Republic could not claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for the territory of the ''Reich'' then under the ''de facto'' government of the German Democratic Republic; \"identity does not require exclusivity\". This was explained as being because the German Democratic Republic was beyond FRG authority and because the Allied powers still had jurisdiction where \"Germany as a whole\" was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court insisted that within the territory of the Federal Republic, the GDR could only be considered as one ''de jure'' German state amongst others, on the analogy of the pre-existing ''de jure'' German states that in 1949 had come together as the Federal Republic; and hence, like them, could never be accorded by the organs of the Federal Republic full recognition as a state in international law; even though the Federal Constitutional Court recognised that, within international law, the GDR was indeed an independent sovereign state.  The constitutional status of the GDR under the Basic Law still differed from that of the ''[[L\u00e4nder]]'' of the Federal Republic, in that the GDR had not declared its accession to the Basic Law; but the Constitutional Court maintained that the Basic Treaty was consistent with the GDR declaring its accession at some time in the future in accordance with its own constitution; and hence the Court determined that in recognising the GDR as a ''de jure'' German State, the Basic Treaty could be interpreted as facilitating the reunification of the German ''Reich'' (as indeed it eventually did). So long as any ''de jure'' German state remained separated from the rest, the German ''Reich'' could continue to exist only in suspension; but should the GDR be reunited with the Federal Republic, the ''Reich'' would once more be fully capable of action as a sovereign state. \n\n:\"In Article 6 the Contracting Parties agree that they shall base themselves on the principle that the sovereign power of each of the two States be confined to its State territory and that they will respect the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs. This agreement too is compatible with the Basic Law only if interpreted to the effect that for the Federal Republic of Germany the basis of this Treaty is the continued existence of Germany, which has according to the Basic Law to be recognized as a State (albeit not organized and therefore not capable of action), and that accordingly the mutual restriction of sovereign power to the territory of the State and respect for the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs has its reference to the special situation in which both States find themselves vis-\u00e0-vis each other as sub-States of Germany as a whole.\"\n\nAfter 1973, however, the claimed identity of the Federal Republic with the German ''Reich'' was not recognised by most other countries of the world. The Soviet Union, the three Western allies, and most other Western countries regarded the German ''Reich'' as still being one nation \u2014 not synonymous with either the West or East German state but rather the two states in collective. Other countries tended to regard the German ''Reich'' as having been divided into two distinct states in international law, and accordingly accorded both states full diplomatic recognition. As of 1974, East Germany's official stance was that the GDR was a new state that is German in nature, a successor of the German Empire,<ref>Donald M. McRae, ''Canadian Yearbook of International Law 2005'', Vol. 43, University of British Columbia, Vancouver 2006, p. 431.</ref> and that there were then two German states that were different nations.\n\n==Reunified Germany==\nWhen the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] between Germany and the wartime Allies was signed on 12 September 1990, there was no mention of the term ''Deutsches Reich'', however the Allies paraphrased the international legal personality of Germany as \"Germany as a whole\" in the English version of the text. Instead the [[states of Germany|states of the Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]], FRG) and the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]], GDR) agreed to be bound by certain conditions which they had to ratify, one of which was the recognising the reunification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin as constituting the full achievement of a united Germany. On meeting these conditions under Article 7.2 \"The United Germany [has] accordingly full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.\"<ref>[http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany], U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany. Updated: November 2003</ref>\n\nUnder Article 1 of the Treaty on Final Settlement, the new united Germany committed itself to renouncing any further territorial claims beyond the boundaries of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; \"The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other states and shall not assert any in the future.\"  Furthermore the Basic Law of the Federal Republic was required to be amended to state explicitly that full German unification had now been achieved, such that the new German state comprised the entirety of Germany, and that all constitutional mechanisms should be removed by which any territories outside those boundaries could otherwise subsequently be admitted; these amendments being bound by treaty not to be revoked.  Article 23 of the Basic Law was repealed, closing off the possibility for any further states to apply for membership of the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic comprised the entirety of the German people; \"This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect\".  This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; \"Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.\" In place of the former Article 23 under which the former GDR had declared its accession to the Federal Republic, a new Article 23 embedded the accession of the Federal Republic to the European Union within the Basic Law; hence with the subsequent accession of Poland to the EU, the constitutional bar on pursuing any claim to territories beyond the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] was reinforced.  In so far as the German Reich may be claimed to continue in existence as 'Germany as a whole', the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] in Poland or Russia, and the western territories, such as the eastern cantons or Elsass-Lothringen, are now definitively and permanently excluded from ever again being united within this Reich under the Basic Law.\n\nHence, although the GDR had by the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic, initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law required by the Treaty of Final Settlement) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.  Hence, although the GDR had nominally declared its accession the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the Treaty of Final Settlement.  These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic 'German Reich', specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer's declaration of accession.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[National colours of Germany]]\n* [[Germany (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Greater Germanic Reich]], a conceptual entity that the Nazis planned to establish during World War II.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|German Empire}}\n*[http://www.geschichte-on-demand.de/index.html Administrative history of the German Reich] {{in lang|de}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/GermanReichMapOfStates1913DeutschesReichStaatenkarte1913atlasFr German Reich map of states 1913 (300 dpi)]\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:German nationalism]]\n[[Category:German Empire]]\n[[Category:Weimar Republic]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Reich"}

Shaw was one of the team leaders for the Rattlers in his sophomore season. Following Otero, he went to [[Black Hills State University]] where he was on a full basketball scholarship<ref name=\"wsm\" /> and received a degree in wellness management.<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nDuring his basketball career, Shaw was \"hooked on the weights\" and he has said that the weight room was his \"sanctuary\".

He then competed in Romania in the [[World Strongman Super Series]]. In September he travelled to his second [[World's Strongest Man]] contest in [[Valletta]]. There he was grouped in what was termed the \"group of death\" not least because of his presence in it. Alongside him in this group was [[Zydrunas Savickas]] who went on to win the title. Although Savickas won the group he and Shaw were separated by just two points. In the final Shaw went on to attain a podium finish, something Randell Strossen of [[Ironmind]] had predicted would happen when he said \"he has to be considered a favorite for a podium position.

Shaw was one of the team leaders for the Rattlers in his sophomore season. Following Otero, he went to [[Black Hills State University]] where he was on a full basketball scholarship<ref name=\"wsm\" /> and received a degree in wellness management.<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nDuring his basketball career, Shaw was \"hooked on the weights\" and he has said that the weight room was his \"sanctuary\".

He then competed in Romania in the [[World Strongman Super Series]]. In September he travelled to his second [[World's Strongest Man]] contest in [[Valletta]].

Although Savickas won the group he and Shaw were separated by just two points. In the final Shaw went on to attain a podium finish, something Randell Strossen of [[Ironmind]] had predicted would happen when he said \"he has to be considered a favorite for a podium position.

Savickas had higher overall placings (2 first places and 1 second place out of 6 events) than Shaw (2 first places and 1 fourth place out of 6 events) and won the 2010 title.\n\nShaw competed against Savickas again in October 2010 at the [[Giants Live]] Istanbul contest.

Komodo Island has a surface area of 390 square kilometres and a human population of over two thousand. The people of the island are descendants of former [[convict|convicts]] who were exiled to the island and who have mixed with [[Buginese people|Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]]. The people are primarily adherents of [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] but there are also [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]] and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] congregations.\n\nKomodo is part of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda chain]] of islands and forms part of the [[Komodo National Park]].

Komodo Island is home to the Komodo Dragon, the largest lizard on earth.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest stories (among Westerners) of a dragon-like animal existing in the region circulated widely and attracted considerable attention.  But no Westerner visited the island to check the story until official interest was sparked in the early 1910s by stories from [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors based in [[Flores]] in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] about a mysterious creature. The creature was allegedly a dragon which inhabited a small island in the Lesser Sunda Islands (the main island of which is Flores).\n[[Image:Vegetation on Komodo Island.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetation on Komodo Island]]\n\nThe Dutch sailors reported that the creature measured up to seven metres (twenty-three feet) in length with a large body and mouth which constantly breathed fire. It burnt them and so they could not continue the investigation. It was believed then that the odd creature could fly. Hearing the reports, Lieutenant Steyn van Hensbroek, an official of the Dutch Colonial Administration in Flores, planned a trip to Komodo Island to continue the search himself. He armed himself, and accompanied by a team of soldiers, he landed on the island. After a few days, Hensbroek managed to kill one of the lizards to investigate.\n\nVan Hensbroek took the dragon to headquarters where measurements were taken. It was approximately 2.1 metres (6.9 feet) long, with a shape very similar to that of a [[lizard]]. More samples were then photographed by Peter A. Ouwens, the Director of the Zoological Museum and [[Bogor Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]] in [[Bogor]], [[Java]]. The records that Ouwens made are the first reliable documentation of details about what is now called the Komodo dragon (or Komodo monitor).\n\nOuwens was keen to obtain additional samples. He recruited hunters who killed two dragons measuring 3.1 metres and 3.35 metres as well as capturing two pups, each measuring less than one metre. Ouwens carried out studies on the samples and concluded that the Komodo dragon was not a flame-thrower but was a type of [[monitor lizard]]. Research results were published in 1912. Ouwens named the giant lizard ''Varanus komodoensis''. Realizing the significance of the dragons on Komodo Island as an endangered species, the Dutch government issued a regulation on the protection of the lizards on Komodo Island in 1915.\n\nThe Komodo dragon became something of a living legend.
