They play in the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[South Atlantic League]] and have been a [[farm team]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]] since 1994.\n\nAsheville teams have played under the Tourists moniker in different leagues and classifications for over a century, with the earliest dating to 1897. The current team has played continuously in what is now known as the South Atlantic League since 1976. They have won three league championships, first in 1984 and most recently in 2014. Previous Tourists teams won a total of four additional championships.\n\nThe Tourists play home games at [[McCormick Field]]. The park opened in 1924, renovated in 1959, and renovated again for the 1992 season. McCormick Field seats 4,000 fans, and is notable for the scoreboard which reads \"Visitors\" in the guest slot and \"Tourists\" in the home slot.<ref name=Jarrett>Jarrett, Keith (May 14, 2007).

Retrieved April 5, 2011.</ref> The \"Tourists\" name dates to 1915, when local sportswriters began referring to the Mountaineers team as the Tourists.<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\nThe original Tourists brought Asheville its first ever professional sports championship in 1915. They continued playing in the Class-D [[North Carolina State League]] until 1917, when the league suspended operations due to World War I. In 1924 the \"Asheville Skylanders\" started play in the [[South Atlantic League]]; however, they soon adopted the Tourists nickname.<ref name=Jarrett/> They played in the South Atlantic League until 1930, when they jumped to the [[Piedmont League]], where they played for two seasons before folding. In 1934 the [[Columbia Sandlappers]] moved to Asheville, taking up the Tourists name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=1934 Columbia Sandlappers/Asheville Tourists Statistics|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> This incarnation won the 1939 Piedmont League championship; however the league suspended operations in 1942, due to the outset of World War II.<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\nIn 1946 a new Tourists franchise started up in the [[Tri-State League]]. During the 1940s they shared McCormick Field with the [[Asheville Blues]], an independent [[Negro Leagues]] team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Asheville_Blues|title=Asheville Blues - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref> They folded along with their league in 1955.<ref name=BE/> In 1959 a new South Atlantic League (later the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]) franchise came to town. McCormick Field was renovated. The team initially wanted a new name, and organized a fan vote to pick. However, fans voted overwhelmingly to keep the Tourists nickname.<ref name=Jarrett/> The team won two league titles, in 1961 and 1968. In 1968, the Tourists won the Southern League championship under manager [[Sparky Anderson]], who went on to manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[Detroit Tigers]] during his 26 years in [[Major League Baseball]].\n\nIn 1972 Asheville became affiliated with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] MLB team. As part of Baltimore's \"Oriole Way\" system, the Asheville team was rebranded the [[Asheville Orioles]], adopting the logo and colors of their affiliate. The team had four successive winning seasons, but after the 1975 season the Orioles relocated their Double-A franchise to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], as the [[Charlotte Orioles]].<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\n===Current team===\n[[File:Rome Braves vs. Asheville Tourists, May 30, 2018 (75).jpg|thumb|The Asheville Tourists in a game against the [[Rome Braves]]]]\nMcCormick Field would not be unoccupied for the 1976 season, however. Shortly after the AA franchise moved to Charlotte, their place was taken by an expansion team in the [[Western Carolinas League]] (now the modern [[South Atlantic League]]). Like many teams before it, it assumed the Tourists nickname. The team has remained in Asheville continuously since, winning the 1984 league championship. They are currently a farm team of the [[Colorado Rockies]], with whom they have been affiliated since 1994. They were previously affiliated with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (1976\u201381) and the [[Houston Astros]] (1982\u201393).  The team has subsequently won two additional league titles in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Tourists played a minor role in the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]''. In the film [[Kevin Costner]]'s character, Crash Davis, finishes his baseball career with the Tourists after being cut from the [[Durham Bulls]], and with them breaks the all-time minor league home run record.\n\nOn January 5, 2010 it was reported by the ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]'' that Palace Sports and Entertainment have sold the team to former [[U.S. Senator]] and current [[Governor of Ohio]] [[Mike DeWine]] and his family. It was reported that Brian DeWine, son of Mike, would be the team president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2010301050012|title=None}}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\n{{Asheville Tourists roster}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] alumni \n* [[Sparky Anderson]] (1968, Manager) Inducted, 2000\n* [[Craig Biggio]] (1987)  Inducted, 2015\n* [[Eddie Murray]] (1974)   Inducted, 2003\n* [[Willie Stargell]] (1961)  Inducted, 1988\n* [[Billy Southworth]] (1935-1936, Player/Manager) Inducted, 2008\n\nNotable alumni\n\n*[[Larry Gardner]] (1925-1926, Player/Manager)\n* [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]] (1929) MLB All-Star\n* [[Mort Cooper]] (1936) 4 x MLB All-Star; 1942 NL Most Valuable Player\n*[[Walker Cooper]] (1939) 8 x MLB All-Star\n* [[Clem Labine]] (1947) 2 x MLB All-Star\n* [[Gene Alley]] (1961\u201362) MLB All-Star\n* [[Bob Lee (baseball)|Bob Lee]] (1961)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Steve Blass]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n*[[Bob Lee (baseball)|Bob Lee]] (1965)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Dave Roberts (pitcher)|Dave Roberts]] (1964)\n* [[Doc Ellis]] (1966) MLB All-Star\n* [[Fred Patek]] (1966) MLB All-Star\n* [[Dave Concepcion]] (1969) MLB All-Star\n* [[Larry Sherry]] (1971)  1959 World Series MVP\n* [[Al Bumbry]] (1973) MLB All-Star\n* [[Doug DeCinces]] (1973)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]](1974) MLB All-Star\n* [[Rich Dauer]] (1974\u201375) \n* [[Tom Henke]] (1981) MLB All-Star\n* [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] (1988)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Kenny Lofton]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n* [[Shane Reynolds]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n* [[Bobby Abreu]] (1992)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Melvin Mora]] (1993) MLB All-Star\n* [[Todd Helton]] (1995)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Matt Holliday]] (1999) MLB All-Star\n* [[Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez]] (2003) MLB All-Star\n* [[Dexter Fowler]] (2006) MLB All-Star\n* [[Brian Fuentes]] (2007)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Nolan Arenado]] (2010)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Russell Wilson]] (2011)  NFL Super Bowl Champion\n* [[Trevor Story]] (2012)  MLB All-Star\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Year-by-year record==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\"\n!

They play in the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[South Atlantic League]] and have been a [[farm team]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]] since 1994.\n\nAsheville teams have played under the Tourists moniker in different leagues and classifications for over a century, with the earliest dating to 1897. The current team has played continuously in what is now known as the South Atlantic League since 1976. They have won three league championships, first in 1984 and most recently in 2014. Previous Tourists teams won a total of four additional championships.\n\nThe Tourists play home games at [[McCormick Field]]. The park opened in 1924, renovated in 1959, and renovated again for the 1992 season. McCormick Field seats 4,000 fans, and is notable for the scoreboard which reads \"Visitors\" in the guest slot and \"Tourists\" in the home slot.<ref name=Jarrett>Jarrett, Keith (May 14, 2007).

Retrieved April 5, 2011.</ref> The \"Tourists\" name dates to 1915, when local sportswriters began referring to the Mountaineers team as the Tourists.<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\nThe original Tourists brought Asheville its first ever professional sports championship in 1915. They continued playing in the Class-D [[North Carolina State League]] until 1917, when the league suspended operations due to World War I. In 1924 the \"Asheville Skylanders\" started play in the [[South Atlantic League]]; however, they soon adopted the Tourists nickname.<ref name=Jarrett/> They played in the South Atlantic League until 1930, when they jumped to the [[Piedmont League]], where they played for two seasons before folding. In 1934 the [[Columbia Sandlappers]] moved to Asheville, taking up the Tourists name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=1934 Columbia Sandlappers/Asheville Tourists Statistics|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> This incarnation won the 1939 Piedmont League championship; however the league suspended operations in 1942, due to the outset of World War II.<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\nIn 1946 a new Tourists franchise started up in the [[Tri-State League]]. During the 1940s they shared McCormick Field with the [[Asheville Blues]], an independent [[Negro Leagues]] team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Asheville_Blues|title=Asheville Blues - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref> They folded along with their league in 1955.<ref name=BE/> In 1959 a new South Atlantic League (later the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]) franchise came to town. McCormick Field was renovated. The team initially wanted a new name, and organized a fan vote to pick. However, fans voted overwhelmingly to keep the Tourists nickname.<ref name=Jarrett/> The team won two league titles, in 1961 and 1968. In 1968, the Tourists won the Southern League championship under manager [[Sparky Anderson]], who went on to manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[Detroit Tigers]] during his 26 years in [[Major League Baseball]].\n\nIn 1972 Asheville became affiliated with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] MLB team. As part of Baltimore's \"Oriole Way\" system, the Asheville team was rebranded the [[Asheville Orioles]], adopting the logo and colors of their affiliate. The team had four successive winning seasons, but after the 1975 season the Orioles relocated their Double-A franchise to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], as the [[Charlotte Orioles]].<ref name=Jarrett/>\n\n===Current team===\n[[File:Rome Braves vs. Asheville Tourists, May 30, 2018 (75).jpg|thumb|The Asheville Tourists in a game against the [[Rome Braves]]]]\nMcCormick Field would not be unoccupied for the 1976 season, however. Shortly after the AA franchise moved to Charlotte, their place was taken by an expansion team in the [[Western Carolinas League]] (now the modern [[South Atlantic League]]). Like many teams before it, it assumed the Tourists nickname. The team has remained in Asheville continuously since, winning the 1984 league championship. They are currently a farm team of the [[Colorado Rockies]], with whom they have been affiliated since 1994. They were previously affiliated with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (1976\u201381) and the [[Houston Astros]] (1982\u201393).  The team has subsequently won two additional league titles in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Tourists played a minor role in the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]''. In the film [[Kevin Costner]]'s character, Crash Davis, finishes his baseball career with the Tourists after being cut from the [[Durham Bulls]], and with them breaks the all-time minor league home run record.\n\nOn January 5, 2010 it was reported by the ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]'' that Palace Sports and Entertainment have sold the team to former [[U.S. Senator]] and current [[Governor of Ohio]] [[Mike DeWine]] and his family. It was reported that Brian DeWine, son of Mike, would be the team president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2010301050012|title=None}}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\n{{Asheville Tourists roster}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] alumni \n* [[Sparky Anderson]] (1968, Manager) Inducted, 2000\n* [[Craig Biggio]] (1987)  Inducted, 2015\n* [[Eddie Murray]] (1974)   Inducted, 2003\n* [[Willie Stargell]] (1961)  Inducted, 1988\n* [[Billy Southworth]] (1935-1936, Player/Manager) Inducted, 2008\n\nNotable alumni\n\n*[[Larry Gardner]] (1925-1926, Player/Manager)\n* [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]] (1929) MLB All-Star\n* [[Mort Cooper]] (1936) 4 x MLB All-Star; 1942 NL Most Valuable Player\n*[[Walker Cooper]] (1939) 8 x MLB All-Star\n* [[Clem Labine]] (1947) 2 x MLB All-Star\n* [[Gene Alley]] (1961\u201362) MLB All-Star\n* [[Bob Lee (baseball)|Bob Lee]] (1961)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Steve Blass]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n*[[Bob Lee (baseball)|Bob Lee]] (1965)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Dave Roberts (pitcher)|Dave Roberts]] (1964)\n* [[Doc Ellis]] (1966) MLB All-Star\n* [[Fred Patek]] (1966) MLB All-Star\n* [[Dave Concepcion]] (1969) MLB All-Star\n* [[Larry Sherry]] (1971)  1959 World Series MVP\n* [[Al Bumbry]] (1973) MLB All-Star\n* [[Doug DeCinces]] (1973)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]](1974) MLB All-Star\n* [[Rich Dauer]] (1974\u201375) \n* [[Tom Henke]] (1981) MLB All-Star\n* [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] (1988)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Kenny Lofton]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n* [[Shane Reynolds]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n* [[Bobby Abreu]] (1992)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Melvin Mora]] (1993) MLB All-Star\n* [[Todd Helton]] (1995)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Matt Holliday]] (1999) MLB All-Star\n* [[Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez]] (2003) MLB All-Star\n* [[Dexter Fowler]] (2006) MLB All-Star\n* [[Brian Fuentes]] (2007)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Nolan Arenado]] (2010)  MLB All-Star\n* [[Russell Wilson]] (2011)  NFL Super Bowl Champion\n* [[Trevor Story]] (2012)  MLB All-Star\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Year-by-year record==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\"\n!

It is produced by [[Ufotable]], directed by Haruo Sotozaki and written by Hikaru Kondo, featuring character designs by Akira Matsushima and music by [[Motoi Sakuraba]] and [[Go Shiina]]. The anime series is split into two halves: the first half premiered on July 3, 2016 and finished airing on September 25, 2016. The second half premiered on January 8, 2017 and finished airing on April 29, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n''Tales of Zestiria the X'' takes place in a world hi\nthere are beings called Seraphim. Humans and Seraphim used to live together in harmony thousands of years ago. The humans prayed to the Seraphim, and in return the Seraphim blessed them. The Seraphim have magical powers and their own element to control. Earth, wind, water, or fire. There were thousands of Seraphim, but mankind was awash with terrible emotions, and could easily be overcome and turn into monsters. When Seraphim became too connected to a human, seeing their friend physically and mentally turn into a monster caused them to despair and their ephemeral forms were quickly turned into monsters as well. The monsters were created when an area was thick with negative emotions that created a dangerous byproduct called malevolence. Malevolence turns any weak or negative living creature into a monster. While Seraphim are turned into powerful dragons, all other living creatures are turned into monsters called Hellions when they are taken over by malevolence.\n\nThe Seraphim kept nature running smoothly and in balance, while a person called the Shepherd kept the malevolence at bay. The Shepherd is a regular person until they are able to pull a sacred sword from a stone. Then they become a living legend with the power to purify all Hellions. They can form contracts with Seraphim and combine their bodies so they can use their elemental powers to purify dangerous creatures. They can also form contracts with humans, who help carry the burden of malevolence. While forming contracts with Seraphim has no adverse consequences, humans are a different story. Should the Shepherd die, so will the humans that have a contract with him or her. Also, the more humans the Shepard has contracts with, the heavier the burden on the Shepherd. They can weigh him or her down and cause problems if there are too many.\n\nAll of this is a simple legend, of course, no one's seen a Shepherd or Seraphim in hundreds of years. The legend says, humans became too self-absorbed and malevolent and therefore lost the ability to see a Seraphim's ephemeral form. That all changes when a certain princess stumbles across a young man who's lived in a Seraphim village his entire life and can see, touch and talk to them just as easily as he does humans. He has a dream to create a world in which Seraphim and humans can coexist again, but he doesn't have the power to act on his desires.

Sorey promises to free him from this fate and attacks again, plunging the two of them into underground river. He sends the Seraphim away so he can fight him on his own.

It is produced by [[Ufotable]], directed by Haruo Sotozaki and written by Hikaru Kondo, featuring character designs by Akira Matsushima and music by [[Motoi Sakuraba]] and [[Go Shiina]]. The anime series is split into two halves: the first half premiered on July 3, 2016 and finished airing on September 25, 2016. The second half premiered on January 8, 2017 and finished airing on April 29, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n''Tales of Zestiria the X'' takes place in a world where there are beings called Seraphim. Humans and Seraphim used to live together in harmony thousands of years ago. The humans prayed to the Seraphim, and in return the Seraphim blessed them. The Seraphim have magical powers and their own element to control. Earth, wind, water, or fire. There were thousands of Seraphim, but mankind was awash with terrible emotions, and could easily be overcome and turn into monsters. When Seraphim became too connected to a human, seeing their friend physically and mentally turn into a monster caused them to despair and their ephemeral forms were quickly turned into monsters as well. The monsters were created when an area was thick with negative emotions that created a dangerous byproduct called malevolence. Malevolence turns any weak or negative living creature into a monster. While Seraphim are turned into powerful dragons, all other living creatures are turned into monsters called Hellions when they are taken over by malevolence.\n\nThe Seraphim kept nature running smoothly and in balance, while a person called the Shepherd kept the malevolence at bay. The Shepherd is a regular person until they are able to pull a sacred sword from a stone. Then they become a living legend with the power to purify all Hellions. They can form contracts with Seraphim and combine their bodies so they can use their elemental powers to purify dangerous creatures. They can also form contracts with humans, who help carry the burden of malevolence. While forming contracts with Seraphim has no adverse consequences, humans are a different story. Should the Shepherd die, so will the humans that have a contract with him or her. Also, the more humans the Shepard has contracts with, the heavier the burden on the Shepherd. They can weigh him or her down and cause problems if there are too many.\n\nAll of this is a simple legend, of course, no one's seen a Shepherd or Seraphim in hundreds of years. The legend says, humans became too self-absorbed and malevolent and therefore lost the ability to see a Seraphim's ephemeral form. That all changes when a certain princess stumbles across a young man who's lived in a Seraphim village his entire life and can see, touch and talk to them just as easily as he does humans. He has a dream to create a world in which Seraphim and humans can coexist again, but he doesn't have the power to act on his desires. The world is falling into darkness and the malevolence that the humans are blissfully unaware of is dangerously close to destroying everyone. How will the princess and her new optimistic friend fair in this world of monsters and mayhem?\n\n==Characters==\n===''Zestiria'' characters===\n{{see also|Tales of Zestiria#Main characters}}\n;{{nihongo|Sorey|\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4|Surei}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-25/tales-of-zestiria-the-x-tv-anime-unveils-cast-staff-teaser-video-visual/.100287|title=Tales of Zestiria the X TV Anime Unveils Cast, Staff, Teaser Video, Visual|date=March 26, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref>|[[Robbie Daymond]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-31/funimation-reveals-broadcast-dub-casts-for-tales-of-zestria-the-x-both-arcs-of-danganronpa-3/.104848|title=Funimation Reveals Broadcast Dub Casts for Tales of Zestria the X, Both Arcs of Danganronpa 3|date=July 31, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Mikleo|\u30df\u30af\u30ea\u30aa|Mikurio}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Michael Johnston (actor)|Philip Lamont]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Alisha Diphda|\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30c0|Ar\u012bsha Difuda}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ai Kayano]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Lailah|\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9|Raira}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Noriko Shitaya]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Carrie Keranen]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Rose|\u30ed\u30bc|Roze}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Caitlin Glass]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Edna|\u30a8\u30c9\u30ca|Edona}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Misato Fukuen]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Kira Buckland]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Dezel|\u30c7\u30bc\u30eb|Dezeru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Ono]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|Christopher Niosi}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n;{{nihongo|Zaveid|\u30b6\u30d3\u30fc\u30c0|Zab\u012bda|pronounced \"Zaveed\"}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenjiro Tsuda]]<ref name=\"AnimeCast\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeCastEN\"/>\n\n===''Berseria'' characters===\n{{see also|Tales of Berseria#Characters}}\n;{{nihongo|Velvet Crowe|\u30d9\u30eb\u30d9\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6,|Berubetto Kurau}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Rina Sat\u014d]]|[[Cristina Vee]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Rokurou Rangetsu|\u30ed\u30af\u30ed\u30a6\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30b2\u30c4,|Rokur\u014d Rangetsu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Benjamin Diskin]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Magilou|\u30de\u30ae\u30eb\u30a5,|Magir\u016b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Sat\u014d]]|[[Erica Lindbeck]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Oscar Dragonia|\u30aa\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30fb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30cb\u30a2,|Osukaa Doragonia}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]|[[Michael Sinterniklaas]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Seres|\u30b7\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba|Shiarizu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}\n\n==Production and release==\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation of the video game, titled ''Tales of Zestiria the X'', which is animated by [[Ufotable]], was announced at the Tales of Festival 2015.

In a hard battle, Sorey is able to defeat Heldalf, releasing him from the monstrous form, but he still remains the Lord of Calamity. The Malevolence uses the beaten Heldalf as a hollow vessel to use. Sorey promises to free him from this fate and attacks again, plunging the two of them into underground river. He sends the Seraphim away so he can fight him on his own. This sacrifice seems to have worked as the Malevolence has stopped and lowered to near non-existent levels around the world. Maotelus proclaims that this is the first time to truly purifying the world. Their battle done, everyone goes their separate ways. In the years that followed, Alisha becomes Queen of Hyland and brokers a peace treaty with Rolance. Lailah is revered by the people of Ladylake and the surrounding countryside, leaving on another adventure with a new Sheapard. Edna has become a Lord of the Land, with Zaveid serving as her bodyguard, and Eizen, who had regained some semblance of humanity with the lowered Malevolence. Rose and Alisha remain close friends. Mikleo is still exploring the world but receives a telepathic contact from Sorey. Mikleo finds Sorey alive and well, revealing that he was able to Purify Heldalf and left him in a far-off country town that was unaffected by his rampage. He and Mikleo decide to head home, hitting up whatever ruins they can find along the way.\n| LineColor       = FFD300\n}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://toz-thex-anime.tales-ch.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|anime|18072|Tales of Zestiria the X}}\n\n{{Tales series}}\n{{Ufotable}}\n\n[[Category:Anime television series based on video games]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Ufotable]]\n[[Category:Tales (video game series)]]\n[[Category:Tokyo MX shows]]\n", "name_user": "2604:6000:db85:6300:5597:d28e:8485:9b83", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Zestiria_the_X"}

Albums ''[[Let's Do It Now]]'' and ''My Face'' (the latter re-released as ''Love Makes'') all failed to chart, producing only a handful of moderately successful singles.\n\nHaddaway appeared on the television show ''Comeback \u2013 Die gro\u00dfe Chance'' in Germany in 2004. He then appeared on a similar UK show ''Hit Me Baby One More Time'' in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version. This exposure led to him scoring a moderate chart hit in Germany with the ballad \"Spaceman\" from his next album ''Pop Splits''. \"What Is Love\" was featured in a 2008 [[Pepsi]] commercial (for Diet Pepsi Max) which parodied the [[leitmotif]] and included several stars including [[LL Cool J]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Busta Rhymes]], but not Haddaway.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2008, Haddaway teamed up with another Eurodance star [[Dr. Alban]] for the single \"I Love the 90's\". In 2009, \"What Is Love\" re-entered charts after German DJ [[Klaas (DJ)|Klaas]] remixed it. The track resurfaced again in 2010 when it sampled heavily in Eminem's single \"No Love\" featuring Lil Wayne. In 2012, Haddaway released the single \"Up and Up\" with [[The Mad Stuntman]], which was a top 20 dance hit in the USA.<ref name=\"Allmusic-charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/haddaway-mn0000548196/awards|title=Haddaway Awards|website=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHaddaway now lives in [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Austria]], and also has a home in [[Cologne]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1658362/bio|title=Haddaway \u2013 Biography \u2013 IMDb|website=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Albums ''[[Let's Do It Now]]'' and ''My Face'' (the latter re-released as ''Love Makes'') all failed to chart, producing only a handful of moderately successful singles.\n\nHaddaway appeared on the television show ''Comeback \u2013 Die gro\u00dfe Chance'' in Germany in 2004. He then appeared on a similar UK show ''Hit Me Baby One More Time'' in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version. This exposure led to him scoring a moderate chart hit in Germany with the ballad \"Spaceman\" from his next album ''Pop Splits''. \"What Is Love\" was featured in a 2008 [[Pepsi]] commercial (for Diet Pepsi Max) which parodied the [[leitmotif]] and included several stars including [[LL Cool J]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Busta Rhymes]], but not Haddaway.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2008, Haddaway teamed up with another Eurodance star [[Dr. Alban]] for the single \"I Love the 90's\". In 2009, \"What Is Love\" re-entered charts after German DJ [[Klaas (DJ)|Klaas]] remixed it. The track resurfaced again in 2010 when it sampled heavily in Eminem's single \"No Love\" featuring Lil Wayne. In 2012, Haddaway released the single \"Up and Up\" with [[The Mad Stuntman]], which was a top 20 dance hit in the USA.<ref name=\"Allmusic-charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/haddaway-mn0000548196/awards|title=Haddaway Awards|website=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHaddaway now lives in [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Austria]], and also has a home in [[Cologne]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1658362/bio|title=Haddaway \u2013 Biography \u2013 IMDb|website=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
