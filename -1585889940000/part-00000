In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520-1593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40-41}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to [[Rome]], where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]].

The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless.

Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1560?-1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115-116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral|pastoral romance]] that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110-111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234-235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148-152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9-31}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza,  share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617).\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520-1593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40-41}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to [[Rome]], where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]].

The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless.

This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100-101}} \n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1560?-1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115-116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November.

Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral|pastoral romance]] that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110-111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234-235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148-152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9-31}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza,  share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Bibilography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617). \n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

The attending doctor, Dr. Doskil ([[Donald Meek]]), and Sir Karell's friend Baron Otto von Zinden ([[Jean Hersholt]]) are convinced that he was killed by a [[vampire]]. They suspect Count Mora ([[Bela Lugosi]]) and his daughter Luna ([[Carroll Borland]]), while the [[Prague]] Police Inspector Neumann ([[Lionel Atwill]]) refuses to believe them.\n\nSir Karell's daughter Irena ([[Elizabeth Allan (actress)|Elizabeth Allan]]) is the Count's next target. Professor Zelen ([[Lionel Barrymore]]), an expert on vampires and the [[occult]], arrives in order to prevent her death. After Irena is menaced by the vampires on several occasions, Zelen, Baron Otto, and her fiance, Fedor ([[Henry Wadsworth (actor)|Henry Wadsworth]]) descend into the ruined parts of the castle to hunt down the undead monsters and destroy them. When Zelen and Baron Otto find themselves alone, however, Zelen [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the Baron and asks him to relive the night of Sir Karell's murder. It is then revealed that the \"vampires\" are actually hired actors, and that the entire experience has been an elaborate [[wikt:charade|charade]] concocted by Zelen in the hopes of tricking the real murderer\u2014Baron Otto\u2014into confessing to the crime. Acknowledging that the charade has failed to produce its intended results, Zelen, along with Irena and another actor who strongly resembles Sir Karell, compels the hypnotized Baron into re-enacting the murder, effectively proving his guilt. During the re-enactment, Baron Otto reveals his true motive: he wished to marry Irena, but her father would not allow it. He also reveals how he staged the murder to resemble a vampire attack.\n\nWith Baron Otto arrested, Irena explains the plot to Fedor, who was not involved in the subterfuge and believed that the vampires were real. The film ends with the actors who played the vampires packing up their supplies, and \"Count Mora\" exclaiming, \"This vampire business, it has given me a great idea for a new act! Luna, in the new act, I will be the vampire! Did you watch me? I gave all of me! I was greater than any REAL vampire!\" which is met with general lack of enthusiasm by his fellow thespians.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lionel Barrymore]] as Professor Zelen\n*[[Elizabeth Allan]] as Irena Borotyn\n*[[Bela Lugosi]] as Count Mora\n*[[Lionel Atwill]] as Inspector Neumann\n*[[Jean Hersholt]] as Baron Otto von Zinden\n*[[Henry Wadsworth (actor)|Henry Wadsworth]] as Fedor Vincente\n*[[Donald Meek]] as Dr. J.

The attending doctor, Dr. Doskil ([[Donald Meek]]), and Sir Karell's friend Baron Otto von Zinden ([[Jean Hersholt]]) are convinced that he was killed by a [[vampire]]. They suspect Count Mora ([[Bela Lugosi]]) and his daughter Luna ([[Carroll Borland]]), while the [[Prague]] Police Inspector Neumann ([[Lionel Atwill]]) refuses to believe them.\n\nSir Karell's daughter Irena ([[Elizabeth Allan (actress)|Elizabeth Allan]]) is the Count's next target. Professor Zelen ([[Lionel Barrymore]]), an expert on vampires and the [[occult]], arrives in order to prevent her death. After Irena is menaced by the vampires on several occasions, Zelen, Baron Otto, and her fiance, Fedor ([[Henry Wadsworth (actor)|Henry Wadsworth]]) descend into the ruined parts of the castle to hunt down the undead monsters and destroy them. When Zelen and Baron Otto find themselves alone, however, Zelen [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the Baron and asks him to relive the night of Sir Karell's murder. It is then revealed that the \"vampires\" are actually hired actors, and that the entire experience has been an elaborate [[wikt:charade|charade]] concocted by Zelen in the hopes of tricking the real murderer\u2014Baron Otto\u2014into confessing to the crime. Acknowledging that the charade has failed to produce its intended results, Zelen, along with Irena and another actor who strongly resembles Sir Karell, compels the hypnotized Baron into re-enacting the murder, effectively proving his guilt. During the re-enactment, Baron Otto reveals his true motive: he wished to marry Irena, but her father would not allow it. He also reveals how he staged the murder to resemble a vampire attack.\n\nWith Baron Otto arrested, Irena explains the plot to Fedor, who was not involved in the subterfuge and believed that the vampires were real. The film ends with the actors who played the vampires packing up their supplies, and \"Count Mora\" exclaiming, \"This vampire business, it has given me a great idea for a new act! Luna, in the new act, I will be the vampire! Did you watch me? I gave all of me! I was greater than any REAL vampire!\" which is met with general lack of enthusiasm by his fellow thespians.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lionel Barrymore]] as Professor Zelen\n*[[Elizabeth Allan]] as Irena Borotyn\n*[[Bela Lugosi]] as Count Mora\n*[[Lionel Atwill]] as Inspector Neumann\n*[[Jean Hersholt]] as Baron Otto von Zinden\n*[[Henry Wadsworth (actor)|Henry Wadsworth]] as Fedor Vincente\n*[[Donald Meek]] as Dr. J.

He was born into a [[Jewish]] [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian noble]] family and studied law, but his life belonged to the opera. He became secretary of the tenor [[Jan Kiepura]] and, together, emigrated to the United States when persecution of the Austrian Jews became unbearable in the late 1930s.\n\nWith the help of his confidante [[M\u00e1rtha Eggerth]], he became acquainted with American musicals and music in general. After the end of the [[Second World War]], Prawy returned to Vienna and brought with him the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]''. It was received by the Viennese with great reservation as they feared the arrival of the American-style musical would spell the end of the traditional Viennese [[operetta]]. Nonetheless, Prawy succeeded and was considered henceforth as the one who made German language musicals acceptable and popular.\n\n==His work in opera==\nFrom 1955 on Prawy served as [[dramaturg]] at the [[Vienna Volksoper]] and from 1972 as chief-dramaturg at the [[Vienna State Opera]]. Between 1976 and 1982 Prawy was a professor at the Vienna College of Music (''Wiener Musikhochschule'', today ''Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien'') and lecturer in the field of theater sciences at the [[University of Vienna]]. He also lectured as a visiting professor at numerous American and Japanese universities.\n\nHe became widely known and highly regarded because of a television and radio broadcast series produced by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], where he introduced his viewers and listeners to the world of opera and operetta with outstanding knowledge and great humor.\n\nPrawy maintained close friendships with many prominent singers, composers and musicians, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Robert Stolz]]. He was awarded numerous awards and honours in Austria and internationally, including honorary citizenship of Vienna and of Miami. Hardly anyone succeeded in picturing opera for his audience as impressively and fervently as he did, and thus Prawy became an institution as the National Opera Guide (''Opernf\u00fchrer der Nation'').\n\nIn his final years, Prawy was quite frank about his unique, and rather eccentric, method of archiving his enormous collection of theatre programmes, recordings, letters, photographs, personal notes, and similar loose sheets gathered over many decades. Although Prawy lived in a room at the [[Hotel Sacher]], he invited journalists into the private apartment he was still keeping: it contained thousands of [[plastic shopping bag]]s, each of which was carefully labelled so that he could readily access any information he needed.\n\nOn his 90th birthday in 2001, a special celebration was held for him in the Vienna State Opera. Prawy's death in 2003, of [[lung embolism]], was regarded as the passing of one of the last witnesses of an old time gone by and greatly mourned by the public.\n\n==Publications==\n* Prawy, Marcel (1970), ''The Vienna Opera''.

He was born into a [[Jewish]] [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian noble]] family and studied law, but his life belonged to the opera. He became secretary of the tenor [[Jan Kiepura]] and, together, emigrated to the United States when persecution of the Austrian Jews became unbearable in the late 1930s.\n\nWith the help of his confidante [[M\u00e1rtha Eggerth]], he became acquainted with American musicals and music in general. After the end of the [[Second World War]], Prawy returned to Vienna and brought with him the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]''. It was received by the Viennese with great reservation as they feared the arrival of the American-style musical would spell the end of the traditional Viennese [[operetta]]. Nonetheless, Prawy succeeded and was considered henceforth as the one who made German language musicals acceptable and popular.\n\n==His work in opera==\nFrom 1955 on Prawy served as [[dramaturg]] at the [[Vienna Volksoper]] and from 1972 as chief-dramaturg at the [[Vienna State Opera]]. Between 1976 and 1982 Prawy was a professor at the Vienna College of Music (''Wiener Musikhochschule'', today ''Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien'') and lecturer in the field of theater sciences at the [[University of Vienna]]. He also lectured as a visiting professor at numerous American and Japanese universities.\n\nHe became widely known and highly regarded because of a television and radio broadcast series produced by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], where he introduced his viewers and listeners to the world of opera and operetta with outstanding knowledge and great humor.\n\nPrawy maintained close friendships with many prominent singers, composers and musicians, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Robert Stolz]]. He was awarded numerous awards and honours in Austria and internationally, including honorary citizenship of Vienna and of Miami. Hardly anyone succeeded in picturing opera for his audience as impressively and fervently as he did, and thus Prawy became an institution as the National Opera Guide (''Opernf\u00fchrer der Nation'').\n\nIn his final years, Prawy was quite frank about his unique, and rather eccentric, method of archiving his enormous collection of theatre programmes, recordings, letters, photographs, personal notes, and similar loose sheets gathered over many decades. Although Prawy lived in a room at the [[Hotel Sacher]], he invited journalists into the private apartment he was still keeping: it contained thousands of [[plastic shopping bag]]s, each of which was carefully labelled so that he could readily access any information he needed.\n\nOn his 90th birthday in 2001, a special celebration was held for him in the Vienna State Opera. Prawy's death in 2003, of [[lung embolism]], was regarded as the passing of one of the last witnesses of an old time gone by and greatly mourned by the public.\n\n==Publications==\n* Prawy, Marcel (1970), ''The Vienna Opera''.

His unfinished novel, ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften}}), is generally considered to be one of the most important and influential [[modernist novel]]s.\n\n==Family==\nMusil was born in Klagenfurt, [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], the son of engineer Alfred ''Edler von''<ref name=\"since October 22, 1917\">He was baptized ''Robert Mathias Musil'' and his name was officially ''Robert Mathias Edler von Musil'' from 22 October 1917, when his father received a hereditary title of nobility [[Edler]], until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was [[Austrian nobility#Abolition of nobility in 1919|forbidden in Austria]].</ref> Musil (1846, [[Timi\u0219oara]] \u2013 1924) and his wife Hermine Bergauer (1853, [[Linz]] \u2013 1924).

He was baptized ''Robert Mathias Musil'' and his name was officially ''Robert Mathias Edler von Musil'' from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made ''[[Edler]]''), until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was [[Austrian nobility#Abolition of nobility in 1919|forbidden in Austria]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Robert Musil, pam\u011btn\u00ed deska, Brno.JPG|right|thumb|Commemorative plaque in [[Brno]]]]\nMusil was short in stature, but strong and skilled at wrestling, and by his early teens, he proved to be more than his parents could handle. They sent him to a military boarding school at [[Eisenstadt]] (1892\u20131894) and then [[Hranice (P\u0159erov District)|Hranice]] (1894\u20131897). The school experiences are reflected in his first novel ''Die Verwirrungen des Z\u00f6glings T\u00f6rless'' (''[[The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless]]'').\n\n==Youth and studies==\nAfter graduation Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897, but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his father's department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied [[engineering]] by day, and at night, read [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] and went to the theatre and art exhibitions. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Ernst Mach]] were particular interests of his university years. Musil finished his studies in three years and, in 1902\u20131903, served as an unpaid assistant to Professor of Mechanical Engineering {{Interlanguage link multi|Julius Carl von Bach|de|3=Carl von Bach}}, in [[Stuttgart]]. During that time, he began work on ''[[The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless|Young T\u00f6rless]]''.\n\nHe also invented {{Interlanguage link multi|Musilscher Farbkreisel|de|3=\"Musil'scher Farbkreisel\"}}, the Musil [[Color triangle|color top]], a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely.<ref>Rupp, H. (1908).

During this time, his several years of relationship began with Hermine Dietz, the 'Tonka' of his own novel, published in 1923. Hermine's syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may have been due to infection from Musil.<ref>Pfohlmann 2012, S. 34; Corino 2003, S. 190\u2013194 und S. 1882 f.</ref>\n\nMusil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched a new round of doctoral studies (1903\u20131908) in psychology and philosophy at the [[University of Berlin]] under Professor [[Carl Stumpf]]. In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi (n\u00e9e Heimann, 21 January 1874 \u2013 6 November 1949). She had been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, ''Young T\u00f6rless'', was published in 1906.\n\n==Author==\nIn 1909, Musil completed his doctorate and Professor [[Alexius Meinong]] offered him a position at the [[University of Graz]], which he turned down to concentrate on writing of novels. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories, (\"The Temptation of Quiet Veronica\" and \"The Perfecting of a Love\") collected in ''Vereinigungen'' (''Unions'') published in 1911. During the same year, Martha's divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to [[Protestantism]] as a sign of their union.[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5012d14x#page-10] [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz67509.html] [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D12180.php] Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal ''[[Die neue Rundschau]]''. He also worked on a play entitled ''Die Schw\u00e4rmer'' (''The Enthusiasts''), which was published in 1921.\n\n[[File:Klagenfurt - Musilhaus - Robert Musil.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Musil at the Musilhaus in [[Klagenfurt]]]]\nWhen [[World War I]] began, Musil joined the army and was stationed first in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and then at Austria's Supreme Army Command in [[Bolzano]]. In 1916, Musil visited [[Prague]] and met [[Franz Kafka]], whose work he held in high esteem. After the end of the war and the collapse of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, ''Drei Frauen'' (''Three Women''), in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], whom Musil called \"great and not always understood\" at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke \"did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time\", but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into \"a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/rilke-the-clay-pot/ |work=The Times Literary Supplement|first=Robert|last=Vilain|title=Rilke the clay pot|date=16 September 2009 }}</ref> However, his work is \"too demanding\" to be \"considered relaxing\".<ref>Robert Musil, ''Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses'', trans.

The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the book's protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess ''qualities''. It is set in [[Vienna]] on the eve of [[World War I]].\n\n''The Man Without Qualities'' brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Although he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of better known colleagues such as [[Thomas Mann]] or [[Hermann Broch]], who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil initially, was critical of Mann.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to [[Eugenie Schwarzwald]]'s salon (the model for [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in ''The Man Without Qualities''). In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, ''The Man Without Qualities''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Thought ==\nThe fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values that engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=155}}</ref> He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation, while at the same time, examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony.<ref name=\":0\" /> Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values that, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways.<ref name=\":0\" /> Musil wrote:<blockquote>After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or a [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] as mere rationalism.

Musil wrote a withering critique of [[Oswald Spengler]] entitled, \"Mind and Experience: Notes for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West (''Geist und Erfahrung: Anmerkung f\u00fcr Leser, welche dem Untergang des Abendlandes entronnen sind'')\", in which he dismantles the latter's misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=166\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nHe deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=171\u2013173}}</ref> Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 1920s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the \"dead end of imperial nationalism.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=187}}</ref> In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Philip |last2=Bartram |first2=Graham |last3=Tihanov |first3=Galin |title=A Companion to the Works of Robert Musil |date=2007 |publisher=Camden House |page=428}}</ref>\n\nMusil was a staunch [[individualist]] who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left.

He saw early Nazism first-hand while he was living in Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1938, when Austria [[Anschluss|was annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Musil and his Jewish wife, Martha, left for exile in Switzerland, where he died at the age of 61. Martha wrote to Franz Theodor Csokor that he had suffered a stroke.<ref>Der Monat 026/1950, pp. 185\u2013189, on www.ceeol.com</ref>\n\nOnly eight people attended his [[cremation]].

He was baptized ''Robert Mathias Musil'' and his name was officially ''Robert Mathias Edler von Musil'' from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made ''[[Edler]]''), until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was [[Austrian nobility#Abolition of nobility in 1919|forbidden in Austria]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Robert Musil, pam\u011btn\u00ed deska, Brno.JPG|right|thumb|Commemorative plaque in [[Brno]]]]\nMusil was short in stature, but strong and skilled at wrestling, and by his early teens, he proved to be more than his parents could handle. They sent him to a military boarding school at [[Eisenstadt]] (1892\u20131894) and then [[Hranice (P\u0159erov District)|Hranice]] (1894\u20131897). The school experiences are reflected in his first novel ''Die Verwirrungen des Z\u00f6glings T\u00f6rless'' (''[[The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless]]'').\n\n==Youth and studies==\nAfter graduation Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897, but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his father's department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied [[engineering]] by day, and at night, read [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] and went to the theatre and art exhibitions. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Ernst Mach]] were particular interests of his university years. Musil finished his studies in three years and, in 1902\u20131903, served as an unpaid assistant to Professor of Mechanical Engineering {{Interlanguage link multi|Julius Carl von Bach|de|3=Carl von Bach}}, in [[Stuttgart]]. During that time, he began work on ''[[The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless|Young T\u00f6rless]]''.\n\nHe also invented {{Interlanguage link multi|Musilscher Farbkreisel|de|3=\"Musil'scher Farbkreisel\"}}, the Musil [[Color triangle|color top]], a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely.<ref>Rupp, H. (1908).

During this time, his several years of relationship began with Hermine Dietz, the 'Tonka' of his own novel, published in 1923. Hermine's syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may have been due to infection from Musil.<ref>Pfohlmann 2012, S. 34; Corino 2003, S. 190\u2013194 und S. 1882 f.</ref>\n\nMusil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched a new round of doctoral studies (1903\u20131908) in psychology and philosophy at the [[University of Berlin]] under Professor [[Carl Stumpf]]. In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi (n\u00e9e Heimann, 21 January 1874 \u2013 6 November 1949). She had been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, ''Young T\u00f6rless'', was published in 1906.\n\n==Author==\nIn 1909, Musil completed his doctorate and Professor [[Alexius Meinong]] offered him a position at the [[University of Graz]], which he turned down to concentrate on writing of novels. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories, (\"The Temptation of Quiet Veronica\" and \"The Perfecting of a Love\") collected in ''Vereinigungen'' (''Unions'') published in 1911. During the same year, Martha's divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to [[Protestantism]] as a sign of their union.[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5012d14x#page-10] [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz67509.html] [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D12180.php] Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal ''[[Die neue Rundschau]]''. He also worked on a play entitled ''Die Schw\u00e4rmer'' (''The Enthusiasts''), which was published in 1921.\n\n[[File:Klagenfurt - Musilhaus - Robert Musil.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Musil at the Musilhaus in [[Klagenfurt]]]]\nWhen [[World War I]] began, Musil joined the army and was stationed first in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and then at Austria's Supreme Army Command in [[Bolzano]]. In 1916, Musil visited [[Prague]] and met [[Franz Kafka]], whose work he held in high esteem. After the end of the war and the collapse of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, ''Drei Frauen'' (''Three Women''), in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], whom Musil called \"great and not always understood\" at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke \"did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time\", but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into \"a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/rilke-the-clay-pot/ |work=The Times Literary Supplement|first=Robert|last=Vilain|title=Rilke the clay pot|date=16 September 2009 }}</ref> However, his work is \"too demanding\" to be \"considered relaxing\".<ref>Robert Musil, ''Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses'', trans.

The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the book's protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess ''qualities''. It is set in [[Vienna]] on the eve of [[World War I]].\n\n''The Man Without Qualities'' brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Although he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of better known colleagues such as [[Thomas Mann]] or [[Hermann Broch]], who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil initially, was critical of Mann.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to [[Eugenie Schwarzwald]]'s salon (the model for [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in ''The Man Without Qualities''). In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, ''The Man Without Qualities''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Thought ==\nThe fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values that engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=155}}</ref> He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation, while at the same time, examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony.<ref name=\":0\" /> Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values that, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways.<ref name=\":0\" /> Musil wrote:<blockquote>After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or a [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] as mere rationalism.

Musil wrote a withering critique of [[Oswald Spengler]] entitled, \"Mind and Experience: Notes for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West (''Geist und Erfahrung: Anmerkung f\u00fcr Leser, welche dem Untergang des Abendlandes entronnen sind'')\", in which he dismantles the latter's misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=166\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nHe deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=171\u2013173}}</ref> Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 1920s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the \"dead end of imperial nationalism.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Robert Musil|last=Thiher|first=Allen|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=187}}</ref> In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Philip |last2=Bartram |first2=Graham |last3=Tihanov |first3=Galin |title=A Companion to the Works of Robert Musil |date=2007 |publisher=Camden House |page=428}}</ref>\n\nMusil was a staunch [[individualist]] who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left.

He saw early Nazism first-hand while he was living in Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1938, when Austria [[Anschluss|was annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Musil and his Jewish wife, Martha, left for exile in Switzerland, where he died at the age of 61.
