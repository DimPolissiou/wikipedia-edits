There was a convoy of eight jeeps with a platoon as escort. On nearing the 21st km milestone, around 100 Naga rebels belonging to Gen Kaito Sema\u2019s Federal Army opened fire on the middle jeep of the convoy.

About 150 yards short of the rebels\u2019 bunkers, Lt Col Chitnis ordered a counter-attack despite being wounded in the leg. He forged ahead undeterred and attacked the rebels with a bayonet, killing one and injuring another. Thereafter when an LMG opened fire on his party from a flank, he again led a bayonet charge against the LMG post and got critically injured in the stomach. As a consequence of his grave injuries, he fell 15 yards from the rebel bunker but that didn\u2019t diminish his zeal as he continued to motivate and guide his platoon to destroy the rebel position.

Starring Brooks, [[Bill Pullman]], [[John Candy]] and [[Rick Moranis]], the film also features [[Daphne Zuniga]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[George Wyner]] and the voice of [[Joan Rivers]]. In addition to Brooks in a supporting role, the film also features Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Rudy De Luca]] in [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\nThe film's setting and characters [[parody]] the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises and popular films including ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey|2001]]'', and the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''. It was released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/spaceballs-45901 |title=Spaceballs - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1987-06-24 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> and one of Brooks's most popular films.\n\n==Plot==\nPlanet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob schemes to force King Roland of the neighboring planet Druidia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess Vespa on the day of her [[arranged marriage]] to the [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Prince [[Diazepam|Valium]]. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with ''Spaceball One'', an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] spaceship with her droid of honor, Dot Matrix.\n\nRoland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his ''mawg'' (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] spaceship, ''Eagle 5'', Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before ''Spaceball One'', rescue both her and Dot, then escape. ''Spaceball One'' tries to follow, but Helmet orders the ship to \"ludicrous speed,\" causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance.\n\nOut of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby \"desert moon of Vega\". The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named Yogurt. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to \"The Schwartz\", a [[metaphysics|metaphysical power]] parodying [[the Force]]. Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.\n\nHelmet and Sandurz break the [[fourth wall]] by using a [[VHS]] copy of ''Spaceballs'' to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders ''Spaceball One'' to the moon. The Spaceballs capture Vespa and Dot, and return with them to planet Spaceball. Their captors threaten to reverse Vespa's [[Rhinoplasty|nose job]], forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take ''Spaceball One'' to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, ''Spaceball One'' transforms into ''Mega Maid'', a colossal robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum is then turned on, sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.\n\nOnce the air is returned to the planet, Lone Starr and his allies enter ''Mega Maid'' and attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with [[lightsaber]]-like \"Schwartz rings\" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes.

Skroob schemes to force King Roland of the neighboring planet Druidia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess Vespa on the day of her [[arranged marriage]] to the [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Prince [[Diazepam|Valium]]. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with ''Spaceball One'', an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] spaceship with her droid of honor, Dot Matrix.\n\nRoland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his ''mawg'' (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] spaceship, ''Eagle 5'', Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before ''Spaceball One'', rescue both her and Dot, then escape. ''Spaceball One'' tries to follow, but Helmet orders the ship to \"ludicrous speed,\" causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance.\n\nOut of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby \"desert moon of Vega\". The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named Yogurt. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to \"The Schwartz\", a [[metaphysics|metaphysical power]] parodying [[the Force]]. Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.\n\nHelmet and Sandurz break the [[fourth wall]] by using a [[VHS]] copy of ''Spaceballs'' to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders ''Spaceball One'' to the moon. The Spaceballs capture Vespa and Dot, and return with them to planet Spaceball. Their captors threaten to reverse Vespa's [[Rhinoplasty|nose job]], forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take ''Spaceball One'' to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, ''Spaceball One'' transforms into ''Mega Maid'', a colossal robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum is then turned on, sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.\n\nOnce the air is returned to the planet, Lone Starr and his allies enter ''Mega Maid'' and attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with [[lightsaber]]-like \"Schwartz rings\" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. They subsequently crash-land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''-like population.\n\nWith Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner, and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt informing him that he is a prince and thus eligible to marry Vespa.
