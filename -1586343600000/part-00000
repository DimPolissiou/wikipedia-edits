Its run-time system is based on [[Equinox (OSGi)|Equinox]], an implementation of the [[OSGi]] core framework specification.<ref>{{cite web |work=OSGi Alliance Site |title=OSGi Certified Products |url=https://www.osgi.org/osgi-certification/osgi-certified-products/ |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing the Eclipse Platform to be extended using other [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the plug-in framework allows the Eclipse Platform to work with typesetting languages like [[LaTeX]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/|title=TeXlipse homepage \u2013 LaTeX for Eclipse|website=TeXlipse.sourceforge.net|access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref> and networking applications such as [[telnet]] and [[database management system]]s. The plug-in architecture supports writing any desired extension to the environment, such as for [[configuration management]]. Java and [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] support is provided in the Eclipse [[Software development kit|SDK]], with support for other [[version control system]]s provided by third-party [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s.\n\nWith the exception of a small run-time kernel, everything in Eclipse is a plug-in. Thus, every plug-in developed integrates with Eclipse in the same way as other plug-ins; in this respect, all features are \"created equal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecplug/|title=Developing Eclipse plug-ins|last=Gallardo|first=David|date=1 December 2002|website=IBM|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref> Eclipse provides plug-ins for a wide variety of features, some of which are from third parties using both free and commercial models. Examples of plug-ins include for [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), for Sequence and other UML diagrams, a plug-in for DB Explorer, and many more.\n\nThe Eclipse SDK includes the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT), offering an IDE with a built-in Java [[incremental compiler]] and a full model of the Java source files. This allows for advanced [[refactor]]ing techniques and code analysis. The IDE also makes use of a ''workspace'', in this case a set of [[metadata]] over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace ''resource'' is refreshed afterward.\n\nEclipse implements the [[graphical control element]]s of the Java toolkit called [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] (SWT), whereas most Java applications use the Java standard [[Abstract Window Toolkit]] (AWT) or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Eclipse's [[user interface]] also uses an intermediate [[graphical user interface]] layer called [[JFace]], which simplifies the construction of applications based on SWT. Eclipse was made to run on [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] during a [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC) Project in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.vogella.com/2014/08/18/eclipse-now-runs-on-wayland/ |title=Eclipse now runs on Wayland |date=18 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017}}, language packs being developed by the ''Babel Project'' provide translations into over 40 [[natural language]]s.<ref name=\"Babel\" />\n\n=={{anchor|RCP}} Rich client platform==\nEclipse provides the [[rich client platform]] (RCP) for developing general-purpose applications.\n\nThe following components constitute the rich client platform:\n* [[Equinox (OSGi)|Equinox OSGi]] \u2013 a standard bundling framework\n* Core platform \u2013 boot Eclipse, run [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n* [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] (SWT) \u2013 a portable [[widget toolkit]]\n* [[JFace]] \u2013 viewer classes to bring [[model view controller]] programming to SWT, file buffers, text handling, text editors\n* Eclipse Workbench \u2013 views, editors, perspectives, wizards\n\nExamples of rich client applications based on Eclipse are:\n* [[IBM Notes]] 8 and 9\n* Attachmate-Novell [[NetIQ]] Designer for Identity Manager\n* [[Apache Directory]] Studio\n* [[Remote Component Environment]]\n* [[DBeaver]]\n\n==Server platform==\nEclipse supports development for [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]], [[GlassFish]] and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server (for development) directly from the IDE. It supports remote debugging, allowing a user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server.\n\n==Web Tools Platform==\nThe Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project is an extension of the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications. It includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages, wizards and built-in applications to simplify development, and tools and APIs to support deploying, running, and testing apps.<ref>{{cite web |access-date= 2 May 2011|publisher=Eclipse.org |title= Eclipse Web Tools Platform Project |quote= The Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project extends the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications.

All are compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework created by IBM. Those projects are separated in several categories: Model Transformation, Model Development Tools, Concrete Syntax Development, Abstract Syntax Development, Technology and Research, and Amalgam.\n\nModel Transformation projects uses [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF) based models as an input and produce either a model or text as an output. Model to model transformation projects includes [[ATLAS Transformation Language]] (ATL), an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given EMF model. Model to text transformation projects contains [[Acceleo]], an implementation of [[MOFM2T]], a standard model to text language from the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). The Acceleo [[Code generation (compiler)|code generator]] can generate any textual language (Java, PHP, Python, etc.) from EMF based models defined with any metamodel ([[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), etc.). It is open-source.\n\nModel Development Tools projects are implementations of various modeling standards used in the industry, and their toolkits. Among those projects can be found implementations of several standards:\n* [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML)\n* [[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML)\n* [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL)\n* [[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN)\n* [[Microsoft Interactive Media Manager|Interactive Media Manager]] (IMM)\n* [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR)\n* [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] (XSD)\n* [[National Electronic Distributors Association]] (NEDA)\n\nThe Concrete Syntax Development project contains the Graphical Modeling Framework, an Eclipse-based framework dedicated to the graphical representation of EMF based models.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe Abstract Syntax Development project hosts the Eclipse Modeling Framework, core of most of the modeling project of the Eclipse Foundation and the framework available for EMF like [[Connected Data Objects]] (CDO), EMF query or EMF validation.\n\nTechnology and Research projects are prototypes of Modeling project; this project is used to host all the modeling projects of the Eclipse Foundation during their incubation phase.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAmalgam provides the packaging and integration between all the available modeling tools for the Eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools.<ref>{{in lang|en}} {{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/amalgam/|title=Amalgation website|access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Application lifecycle management==\n[[Application lifecycle management]] (ALM) and [[task management]] in Eclipse need an optional component called Mylyn ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|a\u026a|l|\u026a|n}}), an [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementation of the [[task-focused interface]].  It provides an API for tools embedding the task-focused interface.  For software developers, it helps a developer work efficiently with many different tasks (such as bugs, problem reports or new features). Tasks are integrated into Mylyn. For all tasks that have been integrated, Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand. It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information.  Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as [[Bugzilla]], [[Trac]], [[Redmine]], [[Mantis Bugtracker|Mantis]],<ref name=\"MANTIS\">{{cite web|url=http://mylyn-mantis.sourceforge.net|title=Mylyn MantisBT Connector|publisher=[[Mantis Bug Tracker]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225092855/http://mylyn-mantis.sourceforge.net/|archive-date=2012-12-25|accessdate=2011-10-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Jira (software)|JIRA]], [[Unfuddle]],<ref name=\"UNFUDDL\">{{cite web|url=https://unfuddle.com/support/extras/mylyn|title=Unfuddle Mylyn Connector|publisher=Unfuddle|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> and [[GitHub]].<ref name=\"github+mylyn\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/852-github-mylyn-connector-for-eclipse|title=GitHub Mylyn connector for Eclipse|date=2011-05-10|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> It focuses on improving productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit, Mylyn is also meant to facilitate multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing expertise.\n\nThe project name comes from [[myelin]], an electrically insulating layer that surrounds neurons' axons.<ref name=\"BUG191406\">{{cite web|url=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=191406|title=Bug191406 - rename Mylar project to Mylyn|publisher=[[Eclipse Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref> The original name of this project, \"Mylar\", replicated a trademark of a [[boPET]] film company, so the [[Eclipse Foundation]] changed the project name.<ref name=\"NAMECHANGEFAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/rename.php|title=Mylar to Mylyn Project Rename FAQ|publisher=[[Eclipse Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\nEclipse supports a rich selection of extensions, adding support for [[Python (programming language)|Python]] via [[pydev|PyDev]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] development via [[#Android_Development_Tools|Google's ADT]], [[JavaFX]] via e(fx)clipse, [[JavaScript]], [[jQuery]], and many others at the Eclipse Marketplace.

The project encompasses all development components, including code-completion, develop PHP and facilitate extensibility. It leverages the existing Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) and Dynamic Languages Toolkit (DLTK).<ref name=\"pdt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=tools.pdt|title=PHP Development Tools|website=projects.eclipse.org|access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Android Development Tools===\nAndroid Development Tools (ADT) was superseded in 2015 by the Eclipse foundation's own plugin, called '''Andmore: Development Tools for Android''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/andmore-development-tools-android%E2%84%A2|title=Andmore: Development Tools for Android\u2122|website=Eclipse Plugins, Bundles and Products - Eclipse Marketplace|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> after Google discontinued development of their plug-in for the Eclipse IDE, that is designed to provide an integrated environment in which to build Android applications. ADT/Andmore extends the abilities of Eclipse to let developers set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug their applications using the Android SDK tools, and export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute their applications. It is freely available to download. Googles' ADT was the official IDE for Android until 2015 but was replaced by Eclipse's Andmore and the official [[Android Studio]].<ref>{{cite

The IDE also makes use of a ''workspace'', in this case a set of [[metadata]] over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace ''resource'' is refreshed afterward.\n\nEclipse implements the [[graphical control element]]s of the Java toolkit called [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] (SWT), whereas most Java applications use the Java standard [[Abstract Window Toolkit]] (AWT) or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Eclipse's [[user interface]] also uses an intermediate [[graphical user interface]] layer called [[JFace]], which simplifies the construction of applications based on SWT. Eclipse was made to run on [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] during a [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC) Project in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.vogella.com/2014/08/18/eclipse-now-runs-on-wayland/ |title=Eclipse now runs on Wayland |date=18 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017}}, language packs being developed by the ''Babel Project'' provide translations into over 40 [[natural language]]s.<ref name=\"Babel\" />\n\n=={{anchor|RCP}} Rich client platform==\nEclipse provides the [[rich client platform]] (RCP) for developing general-purpose applications.\n\nThe following components constitute the rich client platform:\n* [[Equinox (OSGi)|Equinox OSGi]] \u2013 a standard bundling framework\n* Core platform \u2013 boot Eclipse, run [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n* [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] (SWT) \u2013 a portable [[widget toolkit]]\n* [[JFace]] \u2013 viewer classes to bring [[model view controller]] programming to SWT, file buffers, text handling, text editors\n* Eclipse Workbench \u2013 views, editors, perspectives, wizards\n\nExamples of rich client applications based on Eclipse are:\n* [[IBM Notes]] 8 and 9\n* Attachmate-Novell [[NetIQ]] Designer for Identity Manager\n* [[Apache Directory]] Studio\n* [[Remote Component Environment]]\n* [[DBeaver]]\n\n==Server platform==\nEclipse supports development for [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]], [[GlassFish]] and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server (for development) directly from the IDE. It supports remote debugging, allowing a user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server.\n\n==Web Tools Platform==\nThe Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project is an extension of the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications. It includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages, wizards and built-in applications to simplify development, and tools and APIs to support deploying, running, and testing apps.<ref>{{cite web |access-date= 2 May 2011|publisher=Eclipse.org |title= Eclipse Web Tools Platform Project |quote= The Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project extends the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications.

All are compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework created by IBM. Those projects are separated in several categories: Model Transformation, Model Development Tools, Concrete Syntax Development, Abstract Syntax Development, Technology and Research, and Amalgam.\n\nModel Transformation projects uses [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF) based models as an input and produce either a model or text as an output. Model to model transformation projects includes [[ATLAS Transformation Language]] (ATL), an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given EMF model. Model to text transformation projects contains [[Acceleo]], an implementation of [[MOFM2T]], a standard model to text language from the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). The Acceleo [[Code generation (compiler)|code generator]] can generate any textual language (Java, PHP, Python, etc.) from EMF based models defined with any metamodel ([[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), etc.). It is open-source.\n\nModel Development Tools projects are implementations of various modeling standards used in the industry, and their toolkits. Among those projects can be found implementations of several standards:\n* [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML)\n* [[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML)\n* [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL)\n* [[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN)\n* [[Microsoft Interactive Media Manager|Interactive Media Manager]] (IMM)\n* [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR)\n* [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] (XSD)\n* [[National Electronic Distributors Association]] (NEDA)\n\nThe Concrete Syntax Development project contains the Graphical Modeling Framework, an Eclipse-based framework dedicated to the graphical representation of EMF based models.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe Abstract Syntax Development project hosts the Eclipse Modeling Framework, core of most of the modeling project of the Eclipse Foundation and the framework available for EMF like [[Connected Data Objects]] (CDO), EMF query or EMF validation.\n\nTechnology and Research projects are prototypes of Modeling project; this project is used to host all the modeling projects of the Eclipse Foundation during their incubation phase.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAmalgam provides the packaging and integration between all the available modeling tools for the Eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools.<ref>{{in lang|en}} {{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/amalgam/|title=Amalgation website|access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Application lifecycle management==\n[[Application lifecycle management]] (ALM) and [[task management]] in Eclipse need an optional component called Mylyn ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|a\u026a|l|\u026a|n}}), an [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementation of the [[task-focused interface]].  It provides an API for tools embedding the task-focused interface.  For software developers, it helps a developer work efficiently with many different tasks (such as bugs, problem reports or new features). Tasks are integrated into Mylyn. For all tasks that have been integrated, Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand. It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information.  Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as [[Bugzilla]], [[Trac]], [[Redmine]], [[Mantis Bugtracker|Mantis]],<ref name=\"MANTIS\">{{cite web|url=http://mylyn-mantis.sourceforge.net|title=Mylyn MantisBT Connector|publisher=[[Mantis Bug Tracker]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225092855/http://mylyn-mantis.sourceforge.net/|archive-date=2012-12-25|accessdate=2011-10-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Jira (software)|JIRA]], [[Unfuddle]],<ref name=\"UNFUDDL\">{{cite web|url=https://unfuddle.com/support/extras/mylyn|title=Unfuddle Mylyn Connector|publisher=Unfuddle|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> and [[GitHub]].<ref name=\"github+mylyn\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/852-github-mylyn-connector-for-eclipse|title=GitHub Mylyn connector for Eclipse|date=2011-05-10|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> It focuses on improving productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation.

ADT/Andmore extends the abilities of Eclipse to let developers set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug their applications using the Android SDK tools, and export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute their applications. It is freely available to download.

It was released in August 2006. This film marks the directorial debut of [[Shivam Nair]] with a story much closer to the [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s short story, [[White Nights (short story)|White Nights]], on which an earlier [[Raj Kapoor]] film [[Chhalia]] was also based. Nair and [[Imtiaz Ali (director)|Imtiaz Ali]] had earlier directed a telefilm for [[Star Bestsellers]], with the same story.\n\n==Plot==\nThis story is woven around aimless youth Ankush Ramdev ([[Abhay Deol]]) who scrapes a living by acting as a witness in [[Delhi]]'s marriage registrar bureau and a girl Megha ([[Soha Ali Khan]]) who has run away from her home in [[Nainital]], to get married to her love Dheeraj ([[Shayan Munshi]]).\n\nFate intervenes and Dheeraj does not show up at the Marriage Registrar's Office. Dejected, Megha is forced to rely on Ankush's generosity. Ankush helps Megha by getting her a job at a local old age home so that she has the security of a roof over her head. As time passes Megha begins to realize her potential as an educated girl who had earlier dedicated her life to her boyfriend and that relationship, thinking that there was nothing more to her. She realizes that she was wrong, and finally, there comes a day when she tells Ankush that she is glad Dheeraj stood her up at the Marriage Bureau. Else, she would have never known who she really was.\n\nAt the same time, Ankush realizes that the meager amount he earns each day is not enough for him. He still has to repay the loan he had taken for Megha's sake. So he starts working as a bank's representative who opens bank accounts for a commission. Slowly he starts increasing the number of hours working at his new job and reduces those spent at the Marriage Registrar's Office.\n\nA day comes when he is able to repay the loan he had taken for Megha. On learning of this Megha reprimands him for doing so much for a girl who was a stranger to him. But now Ankush is earning 5 times more than he was before. He has a much more respectable job and a future. Ankush believes he has changed because of Megha and her faith in him. Life progresses well for Ankush. Soon he gets an offer to join the same bank as an Area Supervisor, at a handsome salary. Ankush hesitates, as fluent English is a pre-requisite.\n\nMegha inspires Ankush giving him the confidence to realize that all he needed was an opportunity in life to succeed. A relationship develops between Megha and Ankush. Megha decides to leave her past with Dheeraj behind and embrace the future with Ankush by her side.\n\nEverything seems to be falling in place for Ankush when Dheeraj returns. He is persistent in his search for Megha and Ankush's new found happiness crumbles.\n\nAnkush tries to force Dheeraj to return to Nainital. He tries all his wits and energy to do this but does not succeed. He even shows Dheeraj the death certificate of Megha, so that he can return, but Dheeraj has complete faith in his love and Megha.\n\nOne day Ankush's friend gives Dheeraj the whereabouts of Megha. This is on the same day Megha and Ankush have planned to get married. On seeing Dheeraj in the mirror, she gets angry at him and asks him to leave. Dheeraj agrees, but he also insists her to listen to what had happened to him when he was coming to Delhi from Nainital. He has preyed in a plot of [[RDX]] in the train. He somehow escapes from the plot. Megha realizes that what Dheeraj did was not intentional and was just a situation in which Dheeraj was trapped.\n\nMegha talks to Ankush and tells him that she cannot live without Dheeraj and finally Ankush realizes that he is just a friend to her. In the end, Ankush becomes the witness of the wedding of Dheeraj and Megha but asks for his regular fees, severing all connection to Megha and Dheeraj love story.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Abhay Deol]] as Ankush Ramdev\n* [[Soha Ali Khan]] as Megha\n* [[Shayan Munshi]] as Dheeraj Ansaria\n* [[Shakeel Khan (actor)|Shakeel Khan]] as Ankush Friend\n* Kamini Khanna as Ankush's Friend's Ammi\n* Sohrab Ardeshir as Father\n* [[Richa Chadda]] as Interviewer\n* [[Ashwin Chitale]] \n* Murad Ali as Chawl Owner\n* [[Brijendra Kala]] as PCO Owner\n* [[D.

He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in [[Winchester]] and [[Wantage]] portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]] of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards in April.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} He negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a \"holy ring\" associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}}{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=59}} The Danes broke their word and after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}\n\nAlfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas \"and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount a resistance campaign, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===The cake legend===\nA legend tells how when Alfred first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}} Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return. 878 was the nadir of the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}} There is no contemporary evidence for the legend, although it is possible that there was an early oral tradition. The first time that it was actually written down was about one hundred years after Alfred's death.{{sfn|Horspool|2006|p=2}}\n\n===Counter-attack and victory===\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on the supposed site of Egbert's Stone, the mustering place before the [[Battle of Edington]].{{efn|The inscription reads \"ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY\".{{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}} }} ]]\n\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4\u201310 May 878), around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to [[Egbert's Stone]] east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]] where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of [[Wiltshire]] and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of [[Southampton Water]]), and they rejoiced to see him\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187\u201391}}\n\nAlfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]]. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\nAccording to Asser,\n\n{{quote|The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}\n\nThat treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex. After the foundation of Danelaw, it seems that some of Essex would have been ceded to the Danes, but how much is not clear.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nIn 2015, two metal detectorists operating without landowner permission found a large hoard near [[Leominster]] consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. The hoard is believed to have been buried by a Viking during their raids of the area, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred and Mercia by Ceolwulf II. Coins recovered from the treasure hunters depict both kings, \"indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms\u2014at least, for a time\u2014that was previously unknown to historians\".<ref name=\"newsweek.com\" /> According to Gareth Williams of the [[British Museum]], \"these coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom.\"<ref name=\"bbc.com\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that the find \"rewrites Anglo-Saxon history&nbsp;... The presence of both kings on the two emperor coins suggests some sort of pact between the pair.

A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships \"on the high seas\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces.{{sfn|Alfred|1969|p=76}} Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=20-21}}\n\nIn 883\u2014though there is some debate over the year\u2014King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=78}} Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}\n\nThis is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself. Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=89}} Guthrum's death changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Viking attacks (890s)===\n\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was not very loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.|source={{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74\u201375}} }}\n\nIt is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita \u00c6lfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex|C\u00e6dwalla]].{{sfn|Bristol University|2010}}\n\n[[Osferth]] was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother \u2013 mistakenly according to Keynes and Lapidge, and in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n{| class = wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Name!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Birth!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Death!! style=\"width:64%;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]]||||12 June 918||Married c. 886, [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]] d. 911; had issue\n|-\n|[[Edward the Elder|Edward]]||c. 874||17 July 924||Married (1) [[Ecgwynn]], (2) [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], (3) 919 [[Eadgifu of Kent|Eadgifu]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]]||||||Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]]||||16 October 922(?)|| Married and had issue\n|-\n|[[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]]||||929||Married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] d. 918; had issue\n|}\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Alfred the Great's will.jpg|thumb|upright|Alfred's will]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=308}} How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness.

Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.

He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]]. His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers, [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]], [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], reigned in turn before him.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting [[Viking]] invasions. He won a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the [[Danelaw]] in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader [[Guthrum]] to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people's quality of life. He was given the epithet \"the Great\" during and after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and, alongside the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Cnut the Great]], remains the only king of England to be given such a name.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the royal estate of [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]], between 847 and 849.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Nelson|2y=2003|2p=295}}{{efn|According to Asser, Alfred was born in 849 but a regnal list thought to have been produced at his court states that he was 23 years old when he acceded and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that he acceeded after Easter in 871. These sources imply that he was born between Easter 847 and Easter 848.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=47\u201348}}}} He was the youngest of five sons of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. In 853 Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}}\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how, as a child, Alfred won a book of Saxon poems, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in [[Winchester]] and [[Wantage]] portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]] of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius'', which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic [[Tanistry|tanist]], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander. {{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n===Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}} The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870 and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards in April.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=135}}\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nThe Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]].

This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war.

He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|pp=582\u2013584}}\n\nAccording to Asser,\n\n{{quote|The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A chrisom was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[Baptism|baptised]] or christened.

By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101|loc= [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} In 825 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the peoples of Essex, Sussex, Kent and Surrey had surrendered to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], Alfred's grandfather. From then until the arrival of the [[Great Heathen Army]] Essex had formed part of Wessex.

According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus's friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died.

Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]] and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]] and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege of Exeter (893)|Siege of Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nThe force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and forced to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines failed. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A frontal attack on the Danish lines failed but later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred, struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England returned to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM ('Alfred King of the Saxons').]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or [[fyrd]], and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}} According to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694,\n\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service|source={{harvnb|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller-scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The ''hide'' was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A ''hide'' is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The ''hide'' would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many ''hides'' he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n[[File:winchesterwalls.jpg|thumb|right|The walled defence round a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations.]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was a network of ''[[burh]]s'', distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three burhs, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (of which twenty two developed into [[borough]]s.{{efn|The Alfredian ''burh'' represented a stage in the evolution of English medieval towns and boroughs. Of the twenty two burhs that became boroughs three did not attain full town status.{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}{{sfn|Loyn|1991|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Tait|1999|p=18}}) ranged from former [[Roman Britain|Roman towns]], such as [[Winchester]], where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at [[Burpham]] in West Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] in Devon, to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at Winchester.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the ''[[Burghal Hidage]]'' provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the ''hidage'' for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2,400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed, approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}} Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\n\nThe burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ''[[herepath]]s''). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the [[Lympne]] estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or [[Frisians|Frisian]] ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland.{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine [[capitulary]] of 786 that was presented to Offa by two [[papal legates]].{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the Apostolic Letter from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] and Alfred's code is the Apostolic Letter which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord, \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the ''domboc''<nowiki />'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean western Asia, as other versions say \"[[Iudea]]\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"[[Scoti|Scots]]\" (i.e. [[Early medieval Ireland|Irish]]) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]] may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.{{sfn|Keynes|1999|loc=\"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\"}}\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to [[Adam]], thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Effect of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. A solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote, or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''</ref> He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in English===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.{{sfn|Bately|2014|pp=113-142}}\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably, Alfred \u2013 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars \u2013 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius's ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'' ('Blooms') or ''Anthology''. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''\u00e6stels''\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''\u00e6stel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser#The Life of King Alfred|Life of King Alfred]]'',\n\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ...

Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}} An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became lady of the Mercians; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler#Ancient through medieval eras|Butler]] of England.

His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either [[Crohn's disease]] or [[haemorrhoids]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}}{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=58}} His grandson King [[Eadred]] seems to have suffered from a similar illness.{{sfn|Malmesbury|1904|p=145}}{{efn|According to St Dunstan's apprentice, \"poor King Eadred would suck the juice out of the food, chew what remained for a little while and spit it out: a nasty practice that often turned the stomachs of the thegns who dined with him.\"{{sfn|Dunstan|1992|p=248}}}}\n\nAlfred was buried temporarily in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] in [[Winchester]]. Four years after his death, he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). The New Minster moved to Hyde in 1110 a little north of the city, and the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}} Further excavations were inconclusive in 1866 and 1897.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.{{sfn|''The Church Monuments Society''|2014}}\n\nExcavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}} The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones, suggested at the time to be those of Alfred; they proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}} In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The diocese made no claim that they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of [[King Richard III]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2013}}{{sfn|Cohen|2013}} The bones were radiocarbon-dated but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore not of Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis that had been unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, and had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], but this remains unproven.{{sfn|BBC|2014}}{{sfn|Keys|2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|Cultural depictions of Alfred the Great}}\n[[File:Statue of King Alfred in Wantage Market Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Alfred the Great at [[Wantage]], Oxfordshire]]\n\nAlfred is venerated as a saint by some Christian traditions.<ref name=\"cathsaints\">{{cite web|title=Saint Alfred the Great|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-alfred-the-great/|website=CatholicSaints.info|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> Though [[Henry VI of England]] attempted unsuccessfully to have him canonized by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in 1441, he was venerated sometimes in the Catholic Church; however the current \"[[Roman Martyrology]]\" does not mention him.<ref>http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92430</ref>{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=231}}{{efn|Some Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that Alfred should be recognised as a saint.

Later medieval historians such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:\n* The [[University of Winchester]] created from the former King Alfred's College, Winchester (1928 to 2004)\n* [[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]; the local telephone exchange for Alfred University is 871 in commemoration of Alfred's ascension to the throne\n* The [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]]\n[[File:Alfred the Great - Samuel Woodforde.jpg|thumb|upright|18th century portrait of Alfred by [[Samuel Woodforde]]]]\n* [[King Alfred's Academy]], a secondary school in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], the birthplace of Alfred\n* King's Lodge School in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]], so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school\n* The King Alfred School and Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge, so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney\n* The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK\n* King Alfred's house in [[Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield]]\n\nThe Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments [[HMS King Alfred|HMS ''King Alfred'']], and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']] in his honour.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth, in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince, his father Arrybas ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged king Neoptolemus.</ref>, and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacidus was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC Arrybas, Aeacidus father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias's wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 12.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 14; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the Peloponnesos and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 14-17.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 32; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him<ref>Probably 20,000-25,000 men.</ref> while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army.<ref>Historians estimate c. 11,000 men.</ref> The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 33-34.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 34.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 34-35.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 35-36.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 37.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch, ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius 'Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual'.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 37-39; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius, ''Guide to Greece'', 1.7.</ref>\n\n==Struggle with Rome==\n{{Main|Pyrrhic War|}}\n[[Image:Pyrrhic War Italy en.svg|thumb|left|Routes taken against Rome in the [[Pyrrhic War]] (280\u2013275 BC).]]\n[[Image:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|thumb|Tribes of Epirus in antiquity.]]\n[[File:Pyrrhus and his Elephants.gif|thumb|upright|Pyrrhus and his elephants.]]\n\nThe Greek city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], in [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]], fell out with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] due to a violation of an old treaty that specified Rome was not to send warships into the [[Tarentine Gulf]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hackens|1992|loc=pp. 20-21: \"When, however, a Roman fleet sailed into the Tarentine Gulf (perhaps in order to place a garrison in Thurii) and thereby violated the terms of a treaty probably made at the time of Cleomynus, Tarentum responded swiftly \u2026 \"}}</ref> In 282 BC, the Romans installed garrisons in the Greek cities of [[Thurii]] (on the western end of the Tarentine Gulf), [[Locri]], and [[Rhegium]], and sent warships to Thurii. Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0060%3Achapter%3D17%3Asection%3D4 17.4].</ref> Several tribes, including the [[Lucanians]], [[Bruttii]], [[Messapians]], and the Greek cities of [[Crotone|Croton]] and [[Locri]], joined Pyrrhus.

In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus of Epirus'', pp 125\u2212128; Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus of Epirus'', p. 128</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian.

As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]].

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth, in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince, his father Arrybas ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged king Neoptolemus.</ref>, and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacidus was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC Arrybas, Aeacidus father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias's wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 12.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 14; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the Peloponnesos and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 15.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 14-17.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 32; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him<ref>Probably 20,000-25,000 men.</ref> while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army.<ref>Historians estimate c. 11,000 men.</ref> The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 33-34.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 34.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 34-35.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 35-36.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', p. 37.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch, ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius 'Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual'.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus'', pp 37-39; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius, ''Guide to Greece'', 1.7.</ref>\n\n==Struggle with Rome==\n{{Main|Pyrrhic War|}}\n[[Image:Pyrrhic War Italy en.svg|thumb|left|Routes taken against Rome in the [[Pyrrhic War]] (280\u2013275 BC).]]\n[[Image:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|thumb|Tribes of Epirus in antiquity.]]\n[[File:Pyrrhus and his Elephants.gif|thumb|upright|Pyrrhus and his elephants.]]\n\nThe Greek city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], in [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]], fell out with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] due to a violation of an old treaty that specified Rome was not to send warships into the [[Tarentine Gulf]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hackens|1992|loc=pp. 20-21: \"When, however, a Roman fleet sailed into the Tarentine Gulf (perhaps in order to place a garrison in Thurii) and thereby violated the terms of a treaty probably made at the time of Cleomynus, Tarentum responded swiftly \u2026 \"}}</ref> In 282 BC, the Romans installed garrisons in the Greek cities of [[Thurii]] (on the western end of the Tarentine Gulf), [[Locri]], and [[Rhegium]], and sent warships to Thurii. Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0060%3Achapter%3D17%3Asection%3D4 17.4].</ref> Several tribes, including the [[Lucanians]], [[Bruttii]], [[Messapians]], and the Greek cities of [[Crotone|Croton]] and [[Locri]], joined Pyrrhus. He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus spent the winter in [[Campania]].<ref name=BritA/>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008 /> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus of Epirus'', pp 125\u2212128; Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>Jeff Champion, ''Pyrrhus of Epirus'', p. 128</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian. ''History of the Syrian Wars'', [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html \u00a710] and [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_03.html \u00a711].</ref> While he was a mercurial and often restless leader, and not always a wise king, he was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time. \n\nPyrrhus was known for his benevolence. As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus. His third wife was the daughter of [[Audoleon]], King of [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]; his fourth wife was the Illyrian princess [[Bircenna]], who was the daughter of King [[Bardylis II]] (r. c. 295\u2013290 BC); and his fifth wife was the daughter of [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], whom he married in 281/280 BC.
