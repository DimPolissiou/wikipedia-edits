Avdo Karabegovi\u0107''', was a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]], poet who was active between 1895 and 1908.\n\nBorn to a prominent but impoverished [[Muslim]] landowning family in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Karabegovi\u0107's poetry was first published when he was seventeen. An ardent [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]], he attended school in [[Anatolia]] for several years before relocating to  [[Belgrade]]. In 1900, Karabegovi\u0107 and fellow Muslim Serbophiles [[Osman \u0110iki\u0107]] and [[Omer-beg Sulejmanpa\u0161i\u0107]] printed a book of Serbian patriotic poetry. Later that year, upon entering [[Austria-Hungary]] on a visit to neighbouring [[Zemun]], Karabegovi\u0107 was arrested for [[draft evasion]] by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and forcibly inducted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], where he contracted [[tuberculosis]].\n\nShortly after being discharged from the Austro-Hungarian Army, Karabegovi\u0107 was stripped of his Austrian citizenship. He subsequently returned to Serbia and completed teachers' college. In 1905, Karabegovi\u0107 published his second and final poetry collection. Later that year, he was hired to teach Muslim schoolchildren in the town of [[Mali Zvornik]], in western Serbia. By 1908, Karabegovi\u0107's health had deteriorated rapidly, and in November of that year, his friends took him to a hospital in the town of [[Loznica]], where he died the following month. His body was buried at Belgrade's [[Belgrade's New Cemetery|New Cemetery]].\n\n==Biography==\nAvdo Karabegovi\u0107 was born into a prominent but impoverished [[Muslim]] land-owning family in the town of [[Modri\u010da]], in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], on 25 August 1878. He was the son of Halim-beg and Fatima Karabegovi\u0107 ({{nee|Mustajbegovi\u0107}}).{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} The Karabegovi\u0107 clan is believed to have originated from the village of [[Budim Do]], in western [[Herzegovina]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, four brothers from the clan left the village and migrated northward, settling in [[Zenica]], Biha\u0107, [[Mostar]] and Modri\u010da, respectively.{{sfn|Kamberovi\u0107|2003|p=389}} Karabegovi\u0107 personally believed that he was descended from the medieval [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], which ruled the [[Principality of Zeta]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 completed his [[primary education]] in Modri\u010da, where he also attended [[maktab]]. He became a published writer at the age of seventeen. His first work, a poem titled ''Zec'' (Rabbit), was published in the periodical ''Br\u0161ljan'' (Ivy) in 1895. His second poem, ''Srpstvu'' (To Serbdom), was published in the periodical ''Bosanska vila'' (Bosnian Nymph) in 1896.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} Karabegovi\u0107 adopted the letter ''[[S]].'' as his first initial, which stood for ''Srbin'' ([[Serbs|Serb]]). This was done, in part, to emphasize his self-identification as a Serb, but also to distinguish himself from his cousin [[Avdo Karabegovi\u0107 Hasanbegov]].{{sfn|Banac|1984|p=363}} Karabegovi\u0107 did not shy away from proselytizing and openly espousing his [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]] convictions, going so far as to secretly teach the [[Latin alphabet]] to Hasanbegov, who had been forbidden from receiving a [[Western education]] by his father. After Hasanbegov began publishing pro-Serb periodicals in the Latin alphabet, his home was attacked by a mob.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 subsequently relocated to the town of [[Adapazar\u0131]], in [[Anatolia]], where he attended a [[vocational school]].

He was christened Robert <!--NOTE-->Lewis<!--\"Louis\" vs \"Lewis\" in footnote--> Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of \"Lewis\" to \"Louis\", and he dropped \"Balfour\" in 1873.<ref>Mehew (2004).

His mother's father Lewis Balfour (1777\u20131860) was a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]] at nearby [[Colinton]],<ref>Balfour (1901), 10\u201312; Furnas (1952), 24; Mehew (2004).</ref> and her siblings included physician [[George William Balfour]] and marine engineer [[James Balfour (engineer)|James Balfour]]. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. \"Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister,\" Stevenson wrote. \"I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.\"<ref>''[[Memories and Portraits]]'' (1887), [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/stevenson/robert_louis/s848mp/chapter7.html Chapter VII.

During his many absences he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to [[Edinburgh Academy]], an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in [[Isleworth]] in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, he was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=26438&back= Stephenson, Robert Louis (1850\u20131894) \u2013 Childhood and schooling]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved: 1 August 2013.</ref> In November 1867, Stevenson entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study engineering. He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in the [[The Speculative Society|Speculative Society]] (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, [[Fleeming Jenkin]], whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write.<ref>Furnas (1952), 51\u201354, 60\u201362; Mehew (2004)</ref> Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as \"Bob\"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 86\u20138; 90\u20134; Furnas (1952), 64\u20139</ref> Each year during vacations, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works\u2014to [[Anstruther]] and [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in 1868, with his father on his official tour of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of [[Erraid]] in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of [[Walter Scott]] with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 70\u20132; Furnas (1952), 48\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref> In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was \"wonderfully resigned\" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law (again at Edinburgh University) and [[Admission to practice law|be called to the Scottish bar]].<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 85\u20136</ref> In his 1887 poetry collection ''Underwoods'', Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:<ref>''Underwoods'' (1887), Poem XXXVIII</ref>\n<blockquote>\nSay not of me that weakly I declined<br />\nThe labours of my sires, and fled the sea,<br />\nThe towers we founded and the lamps we lit,<br />\nTo play at home with paper like a child.<br />\nBut rather say: ''In the afternoon of time''<br />\n''A strenuous family dusted from its hands''<br />\n''The sand of granite, and beholding far''<br />\n''Along the sounding coast its pyramids''<br />\n''And tall memorials catch the dying sun,''<br />\n''Smiled well content, and to this childish task''<br />\n''Around the fire addressed its evening hours.''\n</blockquote>\nIn other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress.<ref>Furnas (1952), 69\u201370; Mehew (2004)</ref> Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels.<ref>Furnas (1952), 53\u20137; Mehew (2004.</ref> More importantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist.<ref>{{cite news|title=Like an intelligent hare \u2013 Theo Tait reviews Robert Louis Stevenson by Claire Harman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3635932/Like-an-intelligent-hare.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=4 August 2013|author=Theo Tait|date=30 January 2005|quote=A decadent dandy who envied the manly Victorian achievements of his family, a professed atheist haunted by religious terrors, a generous and loving man who fell out with many of his friends \u2013 the Robert Louis Stevenson of Claire Harman's biography is all of these and, of course, a bed-ridden invalid who wrote some of the finest adventure stories in the language. [...] Worse still, he affected a Bohemian style, haunted the seedier parts of the Old Town, read Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and declared himself an atheist. This caused a painful rift with his father, who damned him as a \"careless infidel\".}}</ref> In January 1873, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: \"Disregard everything our parents have taught us\". Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth, leading to a long period of dissension with both parents:<ref>Furnas (1952), 69 with n. 15 (on the club); 72\u20136</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhat a ''damned'' curse I am to my parents! As my father said \"You have rendered my whole life a failure\". As my mother said \"This is the heaviest affliction that has ever befallen me\". O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is to have damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Early writing and travels===\n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson at 26.jpg|thumb|right|Stevenson, c. 1877]]\nStevenson was visiting a cousin in England in late 1873 when he met two people who became very important to him: [[Sidney Colvin]] and Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as \"Madonna\").<ref>Furnas (1952), 81\u20132; 85\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref> Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson's first paid contribution in ''[[The Portfolio]]'', an essay entitled \"Roads\".<ref>Furnas (1952), 84\u20135</ref>\n\nStevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]],<ref>Furnas (1952), 95; 101</ref> and [[Leslie Stephen]], the editor of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' who took an interest in Stevenson's work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the [[Edinburgh Infirmary]] named [[William Ernest Henley]], an energetic and talkative man with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the model for Long John Silver in ''Treasure Island''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 123-4; Furnas (1952) 105\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref>\n\nStevenson was sent to [[Menton]] on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that.<ref>Furnas (1952), 89\u201395</ref> He made long and frequent trips to the neighborhood of the [[Forest of Fontainebleau]], staying at [[Barbizon]], [[Grez-sur-Loing]], and [[Nemours]] and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there. He also traveled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 128\u201337</ref> He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading \"R.L. Stevenson, Advocate\". His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law;<ref>Furnas (1952), 100\u20131</ref> all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of ''The Art of Golf'' (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878).<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 127</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Fanny Osbourne 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, c. 1876]]\n\nThe canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez in September 1876 where he met [[Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne]] (1840\u20131914), born in [[Indianapolis]]. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin husband Samuel after his participation in the [[American Civil War]]. Their children were [[Isobel Osbourne|Isobel]] (or \"Belle\"), [[Lloyd Osbourne|Lloyd]], and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied art.<ref>Furnas (1952), 122\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref>\n\nStevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay \"On falling in love\" for the ''Cornhill Magazine''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 145\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France.<ref>Furnas (1952), 130\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> In August 1878, she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes]]'' (1879). But he set off to join her in August 1879, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took second-class passage on the steamship ''[[Devonia (steamer)|Devonia]]'', in part to save money but also to learn how others traveled and to increase the adventure of the journey.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 164\u20135; Furnas (1952), 142\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> He then traveled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in ''[[The Amateur Emigrant]]''. It was good experience for his writing, but it broke his health. \n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson House, 530 Houston Street, Monterey (Monterey County, California).jpg|thumb|French Hotel (now \"[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]\"), [[Monterey, California]] where he stayed in 1879]]\nHe was near death when he arrived in [[Monterey, California]], where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the \"[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]\". While there, he often dined \"on the cuff,\" as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by Frenchman Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about \"the Old Pacific Capital\" of Monterey.\n\nBy December 1879, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where he struggled \"all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, January 1880, ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death's door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. \"After a while,\" he wrote, \"my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.\"<ref>\"To Edmund Gosse, Monterey, Monterey Co., California, 8 October 1879,\" ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> When his father heard of his condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period.\n\nFanny and Robert were married in May 1880, although he said that he was \"a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.\"<ref>\"To P.

He wrote about this experience in ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]''. He met [[Charles Warren Stoddard]], co-editor of the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' and author of ''South Sea Idylls'', who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880, he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend [[Sidney Colvin]] on the wharf at [[Liverpool]], happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.\n\n===Attempted settlement in Europe and the US===\n[[File:StevensonAdirondackHome.JPG|thumb|Stevenson's \"[[Cure Cottages of Saranac Lake|Cure Cottage]]\" in [[Saranac Lake, New York]]]]\nStevenson searched in vain between 1880 and 1887 for a residence suitable to his health. He spent his summers at various places in Scotland and England, including [[Westbourne, Dorset]], a residential area in [[Bournemouth]]. It was during his time in Bournemouth that he wrote the story ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', naming the character Mr. Poole after the town of [[Poole]] which is situated next to Bournemouth. In Westbourne, he named his house ''[[Skerryvore]]'' after the tallest lighthouse in Scotland, which his uncle [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]] had built (1838\u201344). In the wintertime, Stevenson travelled to France and lived at [[Davos Platz]] and the Chalet de Solitude at [[Hy\u00e8res]], where he was very happy for a time. \"I have so many things to make life sweet for me,\" he wrote, \"it seems a pity I cannot have that other one thing\u2014health. But though you will be angry to hear it, I believe, for myself at least, what is<!--not a mistake--> is best.\"<ref>\"To Sidney Colvin, Pitlochry, August 1881,\" ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V]]</ref> In spite of his ill health, he produced the bulk of his best-known work during these years. ''[[Treasure Island]]'' was published under the pseudonym \"Captain George North\" and became his first widely popular book; he wrote it during this time, along with ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (which established his wider reputation), ''[[The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses]]'', ''[[A Child's Garden of Verses]]'', and ''[[Underwoods]]''. He gave a copy of ''Kidnapped'' to his friend and frequent Skerryvore visitor [[Henry James]].<ref>References to Skerryvore come from Leon Edel's ''Henry James: A Life'', c. 1985, pp.&nbsp;309\u2013310</ref>\n\nHis father died in 1887 and Stevenson felt free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate, so he headed for Colorado with his mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the [[Adirondacks]] at a cure cottage now known as [[Stevenson Cottage]] at [[Saranac Lake, New York]]. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best essays, including ''Pulvis et Umbra''. He also began ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.<ref>\"To W.E.

He befriended the king's niece Princess [[Ka'iulani|Victoria Kaiulani]], who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Tahiti]], New Zealand, and the [[Samoan Islands]]. During this period, he completed ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'', composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote ''[[The Bottle Imp]]''. He preserved the experience of these years in his various letters and in his ''In the South Seas'' (which was published posthumously).<ref>''In the South Seas'' (1896) & (1900) Chatto & Windus; republished by The Hogarth Press (1987).

He took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for \"Teller of Tales\"). His influence spread among the Samoans, who consulted him for advice, and he soon became involved in local politics. He was convinced that the European officials who had been appointed to rule the Samoans were incompetent, and he published ''[[A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa|A Footnote to History]]'' after many futile attempts to resolve the matter. This was such a stinging protest against existing conditions that it resulted in the recall of two officials, and Stevenson feared for a time that it would result in his own deportation. He wrote to Colvin, \"I used to think meanly of the plumber; but how he shines beside the politician!\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, 17 April 1893, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XXVIII|Chapter XXVIII]]</ref>\n\nHe also found time to work at his writing, although he felt that \"there was never any man had so many irons in the fire\".<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, 3 January 1892, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XIV|Chapter XIV]].</ref> He wrote ''[[Island Nights' Entertainments|The Beach of Falesa]]'', ''[[Catriona (novel)|Catriona]]'' (titled ''David Balfour'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/works|title=Robert Louis Stevenson \u2013 Bibliography: Detailed list of works|accessdate=20 April 2008}}</ref> ''[[The Ebb-Tide]]'', and the ''Vailima Letters'' during this period.\n\nStevenson grew depressed and wondered if he had exhausted his creative vein, as he had been \"overworked bitterly\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, December 1893, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XXXV|Chapter XXXV]]</ref> and that the best he could write was \"ditch-water\".<ref>\"To W.E.

Rider Haggard]].<ref>introduction to 1965 [[Everyman's Library]] edition of the one-volume ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]''</ref> He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as [[Joseph Conrad]] (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and [[Henry James]], with new scholarly studies and organisations devoted to him.<ref name=arata>Stephen Arata (2006). \"Robert Louis Stevenson\".

And he'd never met a child who liked reading Stevenson's ''Kidnapped''. Me neither, I said. My early exposure to both books was via the [[Classics Illustrated]] comic books. But I did read the books later, when I was no longer a kid, and I enjoyed them enormously. Same goes for Stevenson's ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''\n\nThe fact is, Stevenson is a splendid writer of stories for adults, and he should be put on the same shelf with [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Jack London]] instead of in between [[Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Peter Pan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Muppet Treasure Island|newspaper= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|date=1996-02-16|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/muppet-treasure-island-1996|accessdate=2019-05-07}}</ref>}}\n\n==Monuments and commemoration==\n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson sculpture in St. Giles' cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze relief memorial of Stevenson in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh]]\n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson head.JPG|thumb|right|Profile [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Stevenson, [[Writers' Museum]], Edinburgh]]\n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson statue.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Stevenson as a child, outside [[Colinton Parish Church]] in Edinburgh]]\nThe [[Writers' Museum]] near Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile]] devotes a room to Stevenson, containing some of his personal possessions from childhood through to adulthood.\n\nThe [[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]] at 530 Houston Street in [[Monterey, California]], formerly the French Hotel, memorializes Stevenson's 1879 stay in \"the Old Pacific Capital\", as he was crossing the United States to join his future wife, Fanny Osbourne.

As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Leslie Stephen]] and [[William Ernest Henley|W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Henley]], the last of whom may have provided the model for [[Long John Silver]] in ''Treasure Island''. In 1890, he settled in [[Samoa]], where he died in 1894.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim.

He was christened Robert <!--NOTE-->Lewis<!--\"Louis\" vs \"Lewis\" in footnote--> Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of \"Lewis\" to \"Louis\", and he dropped \"Balfour\" in 1873.<ref>Mehew (2004). The spelling \"Lewis\" is said to have been rejected because his father violently disliked another person of the same name, and the new spelling was not accompanied by a change of pronunciation (Balfour (1901) I, 29 n. 1.</ref><ref>Furnas (1952), 23\u20134; Mehew (2004)).</ref>\n\nLighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was civil engineer [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]], and Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]] and [[David Stevenson (engineer)|David]] were in the same field.<ref name=\"Paxton 2004\">Paxton (2004).</ref> Thomas's maternal grandfather [[Thomas Smith (engineer)|Thomas Smith]] had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of [[Inchyra]] in Fife in the fifteenth century. His mother's father Lewis Balfour (1777\u20131860) was a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]] at nearby [[Colinton]],<ref>Balfour (1901), 10\u201312; Furnas (1952), 24; Mehew (2004).</ref> and her siblings included physician [[George William Balfour]] and marine engineer [[James Balfour (engineer)|James Balfour]]. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. \"Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister,\" Stevenson wrote. \"I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.\"<ref>''[[Memories and Portraits]]'' (1887), [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/stevenson/robert_louis/s848mp/chapter7.html Chapter VII.

During his many absences he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to [[Edinburgh Academy]], an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in [[Isleworth]] in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, he was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=26438&back= Stephenson, Robert Louis (1850\u20131894) \u2013 Childhood and schooling]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved: 1 August 2013.</ref> In November 1867, Stevenson entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study engineering. He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in the [[The Speculative Society|Speculative Society]] (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, [[Fleeming Jenkin]], whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write.<ref>Furnas (1952), 51\u201354, 60\u201362; Mehew (2004)</ref> Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as \"Bob\"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 86\u20138; 90\u20134; Furnas (1952), 64\u20139</ref> Each year during vacations, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works\u2014to [[Anstruther]] and [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in 1868, with his father on his official tour of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of [[Erraid]] in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of [[Walter Scott]] with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 70\u20132; Furnas (1952), 48\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref> In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was \"wonderfully resigned\" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law (again at Edinburgh University) and [[Admission to practice law|be called to the Scottish bar]].<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 85\u20136</ref> In his 1887 poetry collection ''Underwoods'', Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:<ref>''Underwoods'' (1887), Poem XXXVIII</ref>\n<blockquote>\nSay not of me that weakly I declined<br />\nThe labours of my sires, and fled the sea,<br />\nThe towers we founded and the lamps we lit,<br />\nTo play at home with paper like a child.<br />\nBut rather say: ''In the afternoon of time''<br />\n''A strenuous family dusted from its hands''<br />\n''The sand of granite, and beholding far''<br />\n''Along the sounding coast its pyramids''<br />\n''And tall memorials catch the dying sun,''<br />\n''Smiled well content, and to this childish task''<br />\n''Around the fire addressed its evening hours.''\n</blockquote>\nIn other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress.<ref>Furnas (1952), 69\u201370; Mehew (2004)</ref> Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels.<ref>Furnas (1952), 53\u20137; Mehew (2004.</ref> More importantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist.<ref>{{cite news|title=Like an intelligent hare \u2013 Theo Tait reviews Robert Louis Stevenson by Claire Harman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3635932/Like-an-intelligent-hare.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=4 August 2013|author=Theo Tait|date=30 January 2005|quote=A decadent dandy who envied the manly Victorian achievements of his family, a professed atheist haunted by religious terrors, a generous and loving man who fell out with many of his friends \u2013 the Robert Louis Stevenson of Claire Harman's biography is all of these and, of course, a bed-ridden invalid who wrote some of the finest adventure stories in the language. [...] Worse still, he affected a Bohemian style, haunted the seedier parts of the Old Town, read Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and declared himself an atheist. This caused a painful rift with his father, who damned him as a \"careless infidel\".}}</ref> In January 1873, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: \"Disregard everything our parents have taught us\". Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth, leading to a long period of dissension with both parents:<ref>Furnas (1952), 69 with n. 15 (on the club); 72\u20136</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhat a ''damned'' curse I am to my parents! As my father said \"You have rendered my whole life a failure\". As my mother said \"This is the heaviest affliction that has ever befallen me\". O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is to have damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Early writing and travels===\n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson at 26.jpg|thumb|right|Stevenson, c. 1877]]\nStevenson was visiting a cousin in England in late 1873 when he met two people who became very important to him: [[Sidney Colvin]] and Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as \"Madonna\").<ref>Furnas (1952), 81\u20132; 85\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref> Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson's first paid contribution in ''[[The Portfolio]]'', an essay entitled \"Roads\".<ref>Furnas (1952), 84\u20135</ref>\n\nStevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edmund Gosse]],<ref>Furnas (1952), 95; 101</ref> and [[Leslie Stephen]], the editor of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' who took an interest in Stevenson's work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the [[Edinburgh Infirmary]] named [[William Ernest Henley]], an energetic and talkative man with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the model for Long John Silver in ''Treasure Island''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 123-4; Furnas (1952) 105\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref>\n\nStevenson was sent to [[Menton]] on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that.<ref>Furnas (1952), 89\u201395</ref> He made long and frequent trips to the neighborhood of the [[Forest of Fontainebleau]], staying at [[Barbizon]], [[Grez-sur-Loing]], and [[Nemours]] and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there. He also traveled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 128\u201337</ref> He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading \"R.L. Stevenson, Advocate\". His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law;<ref>Furnas (1952), 100\u20131</ref> all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of ''The Art of Golf'' (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878).<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 127</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Fanny Osbourne 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, c. 1876]]\n\nThe canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez in September 1876 where he met [[Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne]] (1840\u20131914), born in [[Indianapolis]]. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin husband Samuel after his participation in the [[American Civil War]]. Their children were [[Isobel Osbourne|Isobel]] (or \"Belle\"), [[Lloyd Osbourne|Lloyd]], and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied art.<ref>Furnas (1952), 122\u20139; Mehew (2004)</ref>\n\nStevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay \"On falling in love\" for the ''Cornhill Magazine''.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 145\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France.<ref>Furnas (1952), 130\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> In August 1878, she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes]]'' (1879). But he set off to join her in August 1879, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took second-class passage on the steamship ''[[Devonia (steamer)|Devonia]]'', in part to save money but also to learn how others traveled and to increase the adventure of the journey.<ref>Balfour (1901) I, 164\u20135; Furnas (1952), 142\u20136; Mehew (2004)</ref> He then traveled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in ''[[The Amateur Emigrant]]''. It was good experience for his writing, but it broke his health. \n[[File:Robert Louis Stevenson House, 530 Houston Street, Monterey (Monterey County, California).jpg|thumb|French Hotel (now \"[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]\"), [[Monterey, California]] where he stayed in 1879]]\nHe was near death when he arrived in [[Monterey, California]], where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the \"[[Monterey State Historic Park#Stevenson House|Stevenson House]]\". While there, he often dined \"on the cuff,\" as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by Frenchman Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about \"the Old Pacific Capital\" of Monterey.\n\nBy December 1879, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where he struggled \"all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, January 1880, ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death's door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. \"After a while,\" he wrote, \"my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.\"<ref>\"To Edmund Gosse, Monterey, Monterey Co., California, 8 October 1879,\" ''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Volume 1, [[S:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 1/Chapter IV|Chapter IV]]</ref> When his father heard of his condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period.\n\nFanny and Robert were married in May 1880, although he said that he was \"a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.\"<ref>\"To P.

He wrote about this experience in ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]''. He met [[Charles Warren Stoddard]], co-editor of the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' and author of ''South Sea Idylls'', who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880, he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend [[Sidney Colvin]] on the wharf at [[Liverpool]], happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.\n\n===Attempted settlement in Europe and the US===\n[[File:StevensonAdirondackHome.JPG|thumb|Stevenson's \"[[Cure Cottages of Saranac Lake|Cure Cottage]]\" in [[Saranac Lake, New York]]]]\nStevenson searched in vain between 1880 and 1887 for a residence suitable to his health. He spent his summers at various places in Scotland and England, including [[Westbourne, Dorset]], a residential area in [[Bournemouth]]. It was during his time in Bournemouth that he wrote the story ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', naming the character Mr. Poole after the town of [[Poole]] which is situated next to Bournemouth. In Westbourne, he named his house ''[[Skerryvore]]'' after the tallest lighthouse in Scotland, which his uncle [[Alan Stevenson|Alan]] had built (1838\u201344). In the wintertime, Stevenson travelled to France and lived at [[Davos Platz]] and the Chalet de Solitude at [[Hy\u00e8res]], where he was very happy for a time. \"I have so many things to make life sweet for me,\" he wrote, \"it seems a pity I cannot have that other one thing\u2014health.

''[[Treasure Island]]'' was published under the pseudonym \"Captain George North\" and became his first widely popular book; he wrote it during this time, along with ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (which established his wider reputation), ''[[The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses]]'', ''[[A Child's Garden of Verses]]'', and ''[[Underwoods]]''. He gave a copy of ''Kidnapped'' to his friend and frequent Skerryvore visitor [[Henry James]].<ref>References to Skerryvore come from Leon Edel's ''Henry James: A Life'', c. 1985, pp.&nbsp;309\u2013310</ref>\n\nHis father died in 1887 and Stevenson felt free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate, so he headed for Colorado with his mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the [[Adirondacks]] at a cure cottage now known as [[Stevenson Cottage]] at [[Saranac Lake, New York]]. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best essays, including ''Pulvis et Umbra''. He also began ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.<ref>\"To W.E.

He befriended the king's niece Princess [[Ka'iulani|Victoria Kaiulani]], who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Tahiti]], New Zealand, and the [[Samoan Islands]]. During this period, he completed ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'', composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote ''[[The Bottle Imp]]''.

He took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for \"Teller of Tales\"). His influence spread among the Samoans, who consulted him for advice, and he soon became involved in local politics. He was convinced that the European officials who had been appointed to rule the Samoans were incompetent, and he published ''[[A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa|A Footnote to History]]'' after many futile attempts to resolve the matter. This was such a stinging protest against existing conditions that it resulted in the recall of two officials, and Stevenson feared for a time that it would result in his own deportation. He wrote to Colvin, \"I used to think meanly of the plumber; but how he shines beside the politician!\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, 17 April 1893, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XXVIII|Chapter XXVIII]]</ref>\n\nHe also found time to work at his writing, although he felt that \"there was never any man had so many irons in the fire\".<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, 3 January 1892, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XIV|Chapter XIV]].</ref> He wrote ''[[Island Nights' Entertainments|The Beach of Falesa]]'', ''[[Catriona (novel)|Catriona]]'' (titled ''David Balfour'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robert-louis-stevenson.org/works|title=Robert Louis Stevenson \u2013 Bibliography: Detailed list of works|accessdate=20 April 2008}}</ref> ''[[The Ebb-Tide]]'', and the ''Vailima Letters'' during this period.\n\nStevenson grew depressed and wondered if he had exhausted his creative vein, as he had been \"overworked bitterly\"<ref>Letter to Sidney Colvin, December 1893, ''Vailima Letters'', [[S:Vailima Letters/Chapter XXXV|Chapter XXXV]]</ref> and that the best he could write was \"ditch-water\".<ref>\"To W.E.

{"title_page": "Pedal steel guitar", "text_new": "[[File:Pedals steel guitar moderne.jpg|thumb|Modern pedal steel guitar with two necks]]\n\nThe '''pedal steel guitar''' is a [[Console steel guitar|console]]-type of [[steel guitar]] with pedals and levers that enable playing more varied and complex music than other steel guitar designs.  Like them, it can play unlimited [[glissando|glissandi]] (sliding notes) and deep [[vibrato|vibrati]]\u2014characteristics it shares with the human voice. Pedal steel is most commonly associated with [[American country music]].\n\nPedals and knee levers were added to a steel guitar in the 1950s, allowing the performer to play scales without moving the bar and also to push the pedals while striking a chord, making passing notes slur or bend up into harmony with existing notes. The latter creates a unique sound that has been particularly embraced by country and western music\u2014a sound not previously possible on a non-pedal steel guitar of any type.\n\nFrom its first use in Hawaii in the 19th century, the steel guitar sound became popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century and spawned a family of instruments designed specifically to be played with the guitar in a horizontal position, also known as \"Hawaiian-style\".  The first instrument in this chronology was the [[Hawaiian guitar]] also called a [[lap steel]]; next was a lap steel with a [[Resonator guitar|resonator]] to make it louder, first made by [[National String Instrument Corporation|National]] and [[Dobro]] Corporation. The electric guitar [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] was invented in 1934, allowing steel guitars to be heard equally with other instruments. Electronic amplification enabled subsequent development of the electrified lap steel, then the [[console steel guitar|console steel]], and finally the pedal steel guitar.\n\nPlaying the pedal steel has unusual physical requirements in requiring simultaneous coordination of both hands, both feet and both knees (knees operate levers on [[Medial (anatomy)|medial]] and [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] sides of each knee); the only other instrument with similar requirements is the [[American reed organ]]. Pioneers in development of the instrument include [[Buddy Emmons]], Bud Isaacs, Zane Beck, and [[Paul Bigsby]]. In addition to American country music and Hawaiian music, the instrument is common in sacred music (called [[Sacred Steel (musical tradition)|Sacred Steel]]), [[Steel Guitar Jazz|jazz]], [[Juju Music|Nigerian Music]], and [[Tau Moe|Indian music]].\n\n==Early history and evolution==\n\nThe instrument's ancestry is traced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 19th century after the Spanish guitar was introduced there by European sailors<ref name=\"premier-ross\">{{cite magazine |last1=Ross |first1=Michael |title=Pedal to the Metal: A Short History of the Pedal Steel Guitar |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/22152-pedal-to-the-metal-a-short-history-of-the-pedal-steel-guitar |magazine=Premier Guitar Magazine |accessdate=September 1, 2017 |date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and by Mexican ''[[vaqueros]]'' who came there to herd cattle.<ref name=\"vaqueros\">{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Margalit |title=Ray Kane, Master of Slack-Key Guitar, Dies at 82 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/arts/music/05kane.html |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2008}}</ref> Hawaiians who perhaps did not want to take the time to learn how to play a Spanish guitar, re-tuned the instrument so it sounded a major chord when strummed, then thought to be an \"unorthodox tuning\".<ref name=\"vaqueros\"/> This was known as \"[[slack-key]]\" because some of the strings were slackened to tune to a chord.<ref name=\"premier-ross\"/> To change chords, they used some smooth object, usually a piece of pipe or metal, sliding it over the strings to the fourth or fifth position, easily playing a three-chord song. To make playing easier, they laid the guitar across the lap and played it while sitting. The problem with playing a traditional Spanish guitar this way was that the steel tone bar strikes against the frets making an unpleasant sound unless played very lightly\u2014this was corrected by raising the strings higher off the fretboard with a piece of metal or wood over the nut.<ref name=\"premier-ross\"/> This technique became popular throughout Hawaii.<ref name=\"premier-ross\"/>\n[[File:Kekuku's Hawaiian Quintet.jpg|thumb|Kekuku's Hawaiian Quintet]]\n[[Joseph Kekuku]] was a Hawaiian from [[Oahu]] who became proficient in this style of playing around the end of the 19th century and popularized it\u2014some sources say he invented the steel guitar.<ref name=\"History of the Hawaiian Steel Guitar\">{{Cite web | title=History of the Hawaiian Steel Guitar | website=Hawaiian Steel Guitar Association | url=http://www.hsga.org/new_design/history.htm# | accessdate=21 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729101332/http://www.hsga.org/new_design/history.htm | archive-date=29 July 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He moved to the United States mainland and became [[vaudeville]] performer and also toured Europe performing Hawaiian music.\n\nThe Hawaiian style of playing spread to the United States mainland and became popular during the first half of the 20th century, to the degree that it has been called the \"Hawaiian craze\" which was ignited by several events.<ref name=\"hawaiian-electric\">{{cite book |last1=Duchossoir |first1=A.R. |title=Gibson electric steel guitars : 1935\u20131967 |date=2009 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, WI |isbn=978-1-4234-5702-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYmWrWeuB_0C}}</ref> One such event was a 1912 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical show called ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'', which featured Hawaiian music and elaborate costumes.<ref name=\"hawaiian-conquest\">{{cite web |last1=Ruymar |first1=Lorene |title=The Hawaiian Steel Guitar and It's Great Hawaiian Musicians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlDSDopg3HoC&pg=PA31|publisher=Centerstream Publications|page=31 |date=1996}}</ref> The show became a hit and, to ride this wave of success, it was subsequently taken on the road in the U.S. and Europe, eventually spawning a motion picture of the same name.<ref name=\"hawaiian-electric\"/> Joseph Kekuku was a member of the show's original cast <ref name=\"hawaii-picture\">{{cite news |title=Hawaiian Music to be Feature of Big Chautauqua Program |newspaper=The Colville Examiner |location=Colville, WA |date=July 22, 1916 |issue=No. 456 |page=6 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/194800418 |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> and toured Europe with the ''Bird of Paradise'' show for eight years.<ref name=\"unveil-statue\">{{cite web|title=Polynesian Cultural Center Unveils Statue of Joseph Keku, Inventor of the Hawaiian Steel Guitar |url=http://www.polynesia.com/UnveilJosephKekuku042715.html#.WivyXiOZPUa |website=polynesia.com |publisher=Polynesian Cultural Center |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |date=2015}}</ref> The ''Washington Herald'' in 1918 stated, \"So great is the  popularity of Hawaiian music in this country that 'The Bird of Paradise' will go on record as having created the greatest musical fad this country has ever known\".<ref name=\"herald-fad\">{{cite news |title=Bird of Paradise Brought Hawaiian Music Fad East |newspaper=The Washington Herald |date=April 14, 1918 |issue=No. 4188 |page=1 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/75988934 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref> \n\nAnother event fueling the popularity of Hawaiian music was a radio broadcast called \"[[Hawaii Calls]]\" which began broadcasting from Hawaii to the US west coast.

The new resonator invention was promoted at a lavish party in Los Angeles and demonstrated by the well-known Hawaiian steel player [[Sol Hoopii]]. An investor wrote a check for $12,000 that very night.<ref name=\"beauchamp\"/>\n\nA factory was built to manufacture metal-body guitars with the new resonators. Money problems and disagreements followed, and the Doperyas won a legal battle against Beauchamp over the company, then went on their own to form \"the Dobro Corporation\", [[Dobro]] being an acronym for DOpyera and BROthers. Beauchamp was out of a job. He had been thinking about an \"electric guitar\" for years, and at least part of the dispute with the Dopyeras was over him spending too much time on the electrification idea and not enough on improving the resonator guitar.<ref name=\"beauchamp\"/>[[File:RickenbackerFryingpanPatentDiagram.png|thumb|Rickenbacker Fryingpan Patent Diagram]] Beauchamp enrolled in electronics courses and, for his first effort, he made a single-string guitar out of a [[Lumber|2x4]] piece of lumber and experimented with phonograph pickups, but had no success. He eventually came up with the idea of using two horseshoe magnets encircling the guitar strings like a bracelet, and six small metal rods wrapped with wire to concentrate the magnetic field (one under each guitar string).<ref name=\"history-channel\">{{cite web|title=First-ever electric guitar patent awarded to the Electro String Corporation|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-ever-electric-guitar-patent-awarded-to-the-electro-string-corporation|website=history.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref> \n\nWhen connected to an electronic amplifier and loudspeaker, it worked.<ref name=\"beauchamp\"/> He enlisted the aid of a skilled craftsman to fashion a guitar neck and body to connect to his device.

The pedal mechanism itself has to have its own tuning system. As an example, assume the guitar is tuned perfectly using the familiar tuning pegs easily visible on the guitar. Then assume that the player pushes a pedal and the result is out of tune, but when he releases the pedal, it is in tune again. Underneath the guitar, a system of levers, springs and long rods is seen. At the player's right, on the end of the instrument, is an opening that exposes the ends of the rods, each representing a string. The player fits a small hex wrench that looks like a radio knob onto the rod controlling the out-of-tune note. While holding the pedal down, he turns the knob either direction to fine-tune the pedal in a process completely independent of the original tuning.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/> Bigsby built guitars incorporating his design for the foremost steel players of the day, including [[Speedy West]], Noel Boggs, and Bud Isaacs, but Bigsby was a one-man operation working out of his garage at age 56, and not capable of keeping up with demand.<ref name=\"solenoid\"/> One of Bigsby's first guitars was used on \"[[Candy Kisses (George Morgan song)|Candy Kisses]]\" in 1949 by Eddie Kirk.<ref name=\"all-music-kirk\">{{cite web|title=Eddie Kirk|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-kirk-mn0000140761/biography |website=allmusic.com|publisher=AllMusic, member of the RhythmOne group|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref> The second model Bigsby made went to Speedy West, who used it extensively.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/>\n\n==Bud Isaacs: the birth of a new sound in country music==\n\nIn 1953, Bud Isaacs attached a pedal to a guitar neck to change only two strings, and was the first to push the pedal while notes were still sounding.

Emmons heard Isaacs' performance on the song, and told Bigsby to make his guitar setup to split the function of Isaacs' single pedal into two pedals, each controlling a different string. This gave the advantages of making chords without having to slant or move the bar, e.g., minors and suspended chords.

Like them, it can play unlimited [[glissando|glissandi]] (sliding notes) and deep [[vibrato|vibrati]]\u2014characteristics it shares with the human voice. Pedal steel is most commonly associated with [[American country music]].\n\nPedals and knee levers were added to a steel guitar in the 1950s, allowing the performer to play scales without moving the bar and also to push the pedals while striking a chord, making passing notes slur or bend up into harmony with existing notes. The latter creates a unique sound that has been particularly embraced by country and western music\u2014a sound not previously possible on a non-pedal steel guitar of any type.\n\nFrom its first use in Hawaii in the 19th century, the steel guitar sound became popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century and spawned a family of instruments designed specifically to be played with the guitar in a horizontal position, also known as \"Hawaiian-style\".  The first instrument in this chronology was the [[Hawaiian guitar]] also called a [[lap steel]]; next was a lap steel with a [[Resonator guitar|resonator]] to make it louder, first made by [[National String Instrument Corporation|National]] and [[Dobro]] Corporation. The electric guitar [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] was invented in 1934, allowing steel guitars to be heard equally with other instruments. Electronic amplification enabled subsequent development of the electrified lap steel, then the [[console steel guitar|console steel]], and finally the pedal steel guitar.\n\nPlaying the pedal steel has unusual physical requirements in requiring simultaneous coordination of both hands, both feet and both knees (knees operate levers on [[Medial (anatomy)|medial]] and [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] sides of each knee); the only other instrument with similar requirements is the [[American reed organ]]. Pioneers in development of the instrument include [[Buddy Emmons]], Bud Isaacs, Zane Beck, and [[Paul Bigsby]]. In addition to American country music and Hawaiian music, the instrument is common in sacred music (called [[Sacred Steel (musical tradition)|Sacred Steel]]), [[Steel Guitar Jazz|jazz]], [[Juju Music|Nigerian Music]], and [[Tau Moe|Indian music]].\n\n==Early history and evolution==\n\nThe instrument's ancestry is traced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 19th century after the Spanish guitar was introduced there by European sailors<ref name=\"premier-ross\">{{cite magazine |last1=Ross |first1=Michael |title=Pedal to the Metal: A Short History of the Pedal Steel Guitar |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/22152-pedal-to-the-metal-a-short-history-of-the-pedal-steel-guitar |magazine=Premier Guitar Magazine |accessdate=September 1, 2017 |date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and by Mexican ''[[vaqueros]]'' who came there to herd cattle.<ref name=\"vaqueros\">{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Margalit |title=Ray Kane, Master of Slack-Key Guitar, Dies at 82 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/arts/music/05kane.html |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2008}}</ref> Hawaiians who perhaps did not want to take the time to learn how to play a Spanish guitar, re-tuned the instrument so it sounded a major chord when strummed, then thought to be an \"unorthodox tuning\".<ref name=\"vaqueros\"/> This was known as \"[[slack-key]]\" because some of the strings were slackened to tune to a chord.<ref name=\"premier-ross\"/> To change chords, they used some smooth object, usually a piece of pipe or metal, sliding it over the strings to the fourth or fifth position, easily playing a three-chord song. To make playing easier, they laid the guitar across the lap and played it while sitting.

[[Hank Penny|Noel Boggs]], a lap steel player with [[Bob Wills]], received the first steel guitar made by instrument maker [[Leo Fender]] in 1956.

That same year, [[Alvino Rey]] worked with a machinist to design pedals to change the pitch of strings but was without success. The Harlan Brothers of [[Indianapolis]] created the \"Multi-Kord\" with a universal pedal that could fairly easily be configured to adjust the pitch of any or all strings, but was extremely hard to push when tensioning all strings at once.<ref name=\"solenoid\"/> \n\n[[Gibson Guitar Company]] introduced the \"Electraharp\" in 1940, which featured pedals radially oriented from a single axis at the instrument's left rear leg.[[File:Bigsby steel.jpg|thumb|left=0.72|alt=|Bigsby steel]] The most successful pedal system from the various contenders was designed about 1948 by [[Paul Bigsby]], a motorcycle shop foreman and racer who also invented the commercially successful Spanish guitar vibrato tailpiece.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\">{{cite book |last1=Winston |first1=Winnie |last2=Keith |first2=Bill |title=Pedal steel guitar |date=1975 |publisher=Oak Publications |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8256-0169-9|page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzEZAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> Bigsby put pedals on a rack between the two front legs of the steel guitar.

The pedal mechanism itself has to have its own tuning system. As an example, assume the guitar is tuned perfectly using the familiar tuning pegs easily visible on the guitar. Then assume that the player pushes a pedal and the result is out of tune, but when he releases the pedal, it is in tune again. Underneath the guitar, a system of levers, springs and long rods is seen. At the player's right, on the end of the instrument, is an opening that exposes the ends of the rods, each representing a string. The player fits a small hex wrench that looks like a radio knob onto the rod controlling the out-of-tune note. While holding the pedal down, he turns the knob either direction to fine-tune the pedal in a process completely independent of the original tuning.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/> Bigsby built guitars incorporating his design for the foremost steel players of the day, including [[Speedy West]], Noel Boggs, and Bud Isaacs, but Bigsby was a one-man operation working out of his garage at age 56, and not capable of keeping up with demand.<ref name=\"solenoid\"/> One of Bigsby's first guitars was used on \"[[Candy Kisses (George Morgan song)|Candy Kisses]]\" in 1949 by Eddie Kirk.<ref name=\"all-music-kirk\">{{cite web|title=Eddie Kirk|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-kirk-mn0000140761/biography |website=allmusic.com|publisher=AllMusic, member of the RhythmOne group|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref> The second model Bigsby made went to Speedy West, who used it extensively.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/>\n\n==Bud Isaacs: the birth of a new sound in country music==\n\nIn 1953, Bud Isaacs attached a pedal to a guitar neck to change only two strings, and was the first to push the pedal while notes were still sounding.

Of this recording of \"Slowly\", steel guitar virtuoso Lloyd Green said, \"This fellow, Bud Isaacs, had thrown a new tool into musical thinking about the steel with the advent of this record  that still reverberates to this day.\"<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/>  It was the birth of the future sound of country music and caused a virtual revolution among steel players who wanted to duplicate it.<ref name=\"brenner\">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Patrick|title=Early History of the Steel Guitar|url=http://steelguitaramerica.com/instruction/history/|website=steelguitaramerica.com|publisher=Patrick Brenner|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/>\n\nAlso in the 1950s, steel guitar hall-of-famer Zane Beck<ref name=\"hall-fame\">{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Dewitt|title=Back-Up Pedal Steel Guitar|date=1992|publisher=Mel Bay|location=Pacific, MO|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxoxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|isbn=978-1-61911-598-9}}</ref> added knee levers to the pedal steel guitar. The player can move each knee either right, left or up (depending on the model) triggering different pitch changes. The levers function basically the same as foot pedals, and may be used alone, in combination with the other knee, or more commonly, in combination with one or two foot pedals.<ref name=\"knee-levers\">{{cite web|title=What's This Part?

Emmons heard Isaacs' performance on the song, and told Bigsby to make his guitar setup to split the function of Isaacs' single pedal into two pedals, each controlling a different string. This gave the advantages of making chords without having to slant or move the bar, e.g., minors and suspended chords. Jimmy Day, another prominent steel player of the day, did the same thing, but reversed which strings were affected by the two pedals. This prompted future manufacturers to ask customers if they wanted a \"Day\" or an \"Emmons\" setup. In 1957, Emmons partnered with guitarist/machinist [[Shot Jackson|Harold \"Shot\" Jackson]] to form the [[Sho-Bud]] company, the first company devoted solely to pedal steel guitar manufacture. {{listen |filename= |title=Anytime |description=Emmons Steel Guitar Jazz }}\n\nEmmons made other innovations to the steel guitar, adding two additional strings (known as \"chromatics\") and a third pedal, changes which have been adopted as standard in the modern-day E9 instrument.<ref name=\"emmonsscene\">{{cite magazine |last1=Hurt |first1=Edd |title=Remembering Steel Guitar Innovator Buddy Emmons |magazine=Nashville Scene |date=July 30, 2015 |url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13060173/remembering-steel-guitar-innovator-buddy-emmons}}</ref><ref name=\"add-strings\">{{cite book |editor-last1=Stimeling |editor-first1=Travis D. |last=Miller |first=Tim Sterner |title=The Oxford Handbook of Country Music |chapter=9.

In the early 1970s, musician Tom Bradshaw coined the term \"[[copedent]]\" (pronounced co-PEE-dent), a portmanteau of \"Chord-Pedal-Arrangement\". Often represented in table form, it is a way of specifying the instrument's tuning, pedal and lever setup, string gauges and string windings.\n\nThere are proponents of a \"[[universal tuning]]\" to combine the two most popular modern tunings (E9 and C6) into a single 12 or 14-string neck that encompasses some features of each.<ref name=\"winnie-winston\"/> It was developed by Maurice Anderson and later modified by Larry Bell.
