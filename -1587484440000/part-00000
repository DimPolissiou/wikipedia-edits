He served as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] and as [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] in the cabinet of [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] from 1998 to 2005. Fischer has been a leading figure in the German Greens since the 1970s, and according to opinion polls,<ref>{{cite web |title=Weiterhin gro\u00dfe Unzufriedenheit mit den Spitzenpolitikern |date=4 July 2003 |url=http://tsarchive.wordpress.com/2003/07/04/meldung330600/ |language=de |accessdate=24 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://tsarchive.wordpress.com/2003/07/04/meldung330600/ |archivedate=16 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> he was the most popular politician in Germany for most of the government's duration. Following the [[2005 German federal election|September 2005 election]], in which the Schr\u00f6der government was defeated, he left office on 22 November 2005. In September 2010 he supported the creation of the [[Spinelli Group]], a europarliamentarian initiative founded with a view to reinvigorate efforts to federalise the European Union.\n\n==Early life==\nFischer was born in [[Gerabronn]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], the third child of a butcher, whose family had lived in [[Budakeszi]], [[Hungary]], for several generations. Fischer's family had to leave Hungary in 1946 after it was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Germans of Hungary|ethnic Germans]] were persecuted and expelled by the authorities. His nickname ''Joschka'' is derived from the Hungarian ''J\u00f3ska'', diminutive of Joseph (Hungarian ''J\u00f3zsef''). He was brought up Catholic and served in his childhood as an altar boy in his parish in [[Oeffingen]].<ref>{{cite news|author=M.

Because Fischer never gained a school-leaving certificate, he never attended a university or a college. He neither did compulsory military service nor the alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors, because he failed his physical examination due to poor eyesight.<ref>{{cite news|author=Christoph Schult |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,128137,00.html |title=Zivildienst: Hat sich Joschka Fischer gedr\u00fcckt? |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0%2C1518%2C128137%2C00.html |archivedate=16 November 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Left-wing militant==\nIn 1967, he became active in the [[German student movement]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movement (post-) 1968 (the so-called ''Spontis''), first in [[Stuttgart]] and after 1968 in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. For his regular income, Fischer took several low-wage jobs, such as working in a left-wing bookstore in Frankfurt. During this period, he began attending university events, including lectures organized by left-wing revolutionary students by [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] and [[Oskar Negt]].<ref>Paul Hockenhos, ''Joschka Fischer and the Making of the Berlin Republic,'' Oxford University Press, 2007, p 86</ref> He studied the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and became a member of the militant group, ''Revolution\u00e4rer Kampf'' (Revolutionary Struggle). Fischer was a leader in several street battles involving the radical ''[[Putzgruppe]]'' (literally \"cleaning squad\", with the first syllable being an [[acronym]] for ''Proletarische Union f\u00fcr Terror und Zerst\u00f6rung'', \"Proletarian Union for Terror and Destruction\"), which attacked a number of police officers.

In 1971, he began working for the car manufacturer [[Opel]] and attempted to organise his fellow workers for the coming communist revolution. (This was not organising on behalf of a regular labour union: the vast majority of Opel's workers had already been organised for decades by [[IG Metall]], the German metalworkers' union.) This resulted in his dismissal from the company after six months. Fischer then continued making a living with unskilled work while continuing his activism. He worked as a taxi driver from 1976 to 1981 and later in a bookstore in Frankfurt.\n\nIn the ''Deutscher Herbst'' ([[German autumn]]) of 1977, Germany was rattled by a series of left-wing [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks by the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) and [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)]]. According to Fischer's own account, witnessing these events, particularly the kidnapping and murder of [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe hijacking]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/books/review/27hari.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Red and the Green|first=Johann|last=Hari|date=27 November 2005|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Michael |date=14 February 200 |url=http://www.postwritersgroup.com/archives/kell0211.htm |title=Who is Joschka Fischer? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525141300/http://www.postwritersgroup.com/archives/kell0211.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> made him renounce violence as a means for political change. Instead, he became involved in the [[new social movements]] and later in the newly founded [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], mainly in the state of [[Hesse]]. Nevertheless, in 1978 he said he did not mourn the killings of Schleyer, [[Siegfried Buback]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Ponto]] by the RAF.<ref>Jochen B\u00f6lsche: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-18370244.html ''Die verlorene Ehre der Apo.''] in: ''[[Der Spiegel]].''

Only later had Fischer learned that his car had been used to transport stolen weapons.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nAs Foreign Minister, Fischer apologised for the violence of his ''Putzgruppe'' days, without disassociating himself from the radical movement. Some critics continue to charge that Fischer was the leading figure of a 1976 discussion that led to the use of [[Molotov cocktail]]s in an upcoming demonstration in support of RAF member [[Ulrike Meinhof]]. Fischer was arrested on 14 May 1976 as a suspect in the Molotov cocktail attacks on police, but was released after two days. Fischer stated that he never used Molotov cocktails against the police. The firebombing of policeman [[J\u00fcrgen Weber]]'s police car left Weber with burns over 60% of his body.<ref name=NYT_Firebrand/>\n\n==Green politician==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F065084-0014, Bonn, Pressekonferenz der Gr\u00fcnen, Bundestagswahl.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Joschka Fischer on 17 February 1983]]\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, Fischer was a member of the [[Bundestag]] for the Green party. His stint in federal parliament saw him frequently engage in a frank and confrontational debating style, exemplified by an incident on 18 October 1984, when he addressed [[Richard St\u00fccklen]], then vice president of the parliament, with the words: \"If I may say so, Mr. President, you are an asshole\" (German: \"Mit Verlaub, Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Sie sind ein Arschloch.\"). In 1985, Fischer became Minister for the Environment in the [[Landtag of Hesse]] in the first governmental [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] between the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the Greens. Fischer caused a stir when he appeared at his oath of office ceremony wearing [[Athletic shoe|trainers]]. These sneakers are now part of the shoe collection at the [[German Leather Museum|German Leather and Shoe Museum]] in [[Offenbach, Hesse]].\n\nFischer also expressed his thoughts very frankly in the periodical of the Hessian Green party \"Stichwort Gr\u00fcn\". In an interview with ''[[Bunte]]'' magazine published on 27 July 1989, he rejected [[German reunification]] and demanded that the [[reunification clause]] be deleted from the preamble to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. Even after the growth of the wave of the refugees from [[East Germany]], Fischer on 20 September 1989 demanded that the Federal Republic renounce reunification. In a column for ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' published on 17 November 1989, eight days after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he predicted that reunification would not happen. On 1 October 1990, Fischer said he refused to celebrate reunification.<ref name=kas>{{cite web|title=Schlaglichter der deutschen Einheit.

Fischer was respected for his oratory skills, as well as for his charisma on the political stage. For a large part of the 1990s, with the social democrats languishing in the opinion polls, Fischer's admirers referred to him as the \"real\" leader of the opposition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He parlayed his clout into political success, as he moved the Greens to the centre ground of German politics, paving the way for their first participation in the nation's federal government.\n\n==Foreign Minister==\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 13 February 2001-2.jpg|thumb|Fischer with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on 13 February 2001]]\n\nIn September 1998, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, led by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, defeated the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] government of [[Helmut Kohl]]. The SPD's 41% and the Greens' 7% of the vote set the two parties on a possible path to government through a coalition. Schr\u00f6der stated his preference for a red-green coalition, as did an overwhelming majority of SPD members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} After several weeks of negotiations, a SPD-Green government took power on 27 October 1998, with Fischer appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. By 2005, he was the second longest-serving foreign minister in German postwar history (after [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]]).\n\nIn mid-April 1999, Germany came up with the first peace plan, when Fischer produced a proposal, notably including Russia, that would have rewarded the beginning of a Yugoslav pullout from Kosovo with a bombing pause.<ref>Warren Hodge (4 June 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/04/world/crisis-balkans-memo-continent-europeans-impressed-their-own-unity.html Europeans Impressed By Their Own Unity] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> In May 1999, however, an antiwar protester flung a bag of red paint at Fischer during a party convention debating [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO\u2019s airstrikes on Yugoslavia]] in the war over Kosovo; Fischer suffered a perforated eardrum.<ref>Tony Czuczka (23 September 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-09-23/green-party-s-trittin-hit-in-yoghurt-attack-at-hanover-anti-nuclear-event German Greens\u2019 Trittin Hit in Yoghurt Attack, Police Says] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to make it easier for antiwar critics to back Schr\u00f6der\u2019s decision to send German [[Bundeswehr]] troops to [[Afghanistan]] in 2001, Fischer and Development Minister [[Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul]] announced a 256 million marks ($115 million) humanitarian-aid package for Afghan refugees.<ref>William Boston (15 November 2001), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1005774857206960440 Germany's Schroeder Presses Coalition To Back Him With Vote of Confidence] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> In late 2001, Fischer hosted \u2013 under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] \u2013 a ten-day conference at the German [[Hotel Petersberg|government guesthouse]] above the Rhine River, where delegates from four Afghan factions signed the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] establishing a transitional government for the country to replace the deposed [[Taliban]] regime.<ref>Peter Finn (28 November 2001), [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-11-28/news/0111280283_1_northern-alliance-pashtun-delegates Afghan Delegates At U.N.

Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] and [[Oskar Negt]].<ref>Paul Hockenhos, ''Joschka Fischer and the Making of the Berlin Republic,'' Oxford University Press, 2007, p 86</ref> He studied the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and became a member of the militant group, ''Revolution\u00e4rer Kampf'' (Revolutionary Struggle). Fischer was a leader in several street battles involving the radical ''[[Putzgruppe]]'' (literally \"cleaning squad\", with the first syllable being an [[acronym]] for ''Proletarische Union f\u00fcr Terror und Zerst\u00f6rung'', \"Proletarian Union for Terror and Destruction\"), which attacked a number of police officers.

In 1971, he began working for the car manufacturer [[Opel]] and attempted to organise his fellow workers for the coming communist revolution. (This was not organising on behalf of a regular labour union: the vast majority of Opel's workers had already been organised for decades by [[IG Metall]], the German metalworkers' union.) This resulted in his dismissal from the company after six months. Fischer then continued making a living with unskilled work while continuing his activism. He worked as a taxi driver from 1976 to 1981 and later in a bookstore in Frankfurt.\n\nIn the ''Deutscher Herbst'' ([[German autumn]]) of 1977, Germany was rattled by a series of left-wing [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks by the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) and [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)]].

Some critics continue to charge that Fischer was the leading figure of a 1976 discussion that led to the use of [[Molotov cocktail]]s in an upcoming demonstration in support of RAF member [[Ulrike Meinhof]]. Fischer was arrested on 14 May 1976 as a suspect in the Molotov cocktail attacks on police, but was released after two days. Fischer stated that he never used Molotov cocktails against the police.

His stint in federal parliament saw him frequently engage in a frank and confrontational debating style, exemplified by an incident on 18 October 1984, when he addressed [[Richard St\u00fccklen]], then vice president of the parliament, with the words: \"If I may say so, Mr. President, you are an asshole\" (German: \"Mit Verlaub, Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Sie sind ein Arschloch.\"). In 1985, Fischer became Minister for the Environment in the [[Landtag of Hesse]] in the first governmental [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] between the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the Greens. Fischer caused a stir when he appeared at his oath of office ceremony wearing [[Athletic shoe|trainers]]. These sneakers are now part of the shoe collection at the [[German Leather Museum|German Leather and Shoe Museum]] in [[Offenbach, Hesse]].\n\nFischer also expressed his thoughts very frankly in the periodical of the Hessian Green party \"Stichwort Gr\u00fcn\". In an interview with ''[[Bunte]]'' magazine published on 27 July 1989, he rejected [[German reunification]] and demanded that the [[reunification clause]] be deleted from the preamble to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. Even after the growth of the wave of the refugees from [[East Germany]], Fischer on 20 September 1989 demanded that the Federal Republic renounce reunification. In a column for ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' published on 17 November 1989, eight days after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he predicted that reunification would not happen. On 1 October 1990, Fischer said he refused to celebrate reunification.<ref name=kas>{{cite web|title=Schlaglichter der deutschen Einheit.

Fischer was respected for his oratory skills, as well as for his charisma on the political stage. For a large part of the 1990s, with the social democrats languishing in the opinion polls, Fischer's admirers referred to him as the \"real\" leader of the opposition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He parlayed his clout into political success, as he moved the Greens to the centre ground of German politics, paving the way for their first participation in the nation's federal government.\n\n==Foreign Minister==\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 13 February 2001-2.jpg|thumb|Fischer with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on 13 February 2001]]\n\nIn September 1998, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, led by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, defeated the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] government of [[Helmut Kohl]]. The SPD's 41% and the Greens' 7% of the vote set the two parties on a possible path to government through a coalition. Schr\u00f6der stated his preference for a red-green coalition, as did an overwhelming majority of SPD members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} After several weeks of negotiations, a SPD-Green government took power on 27 October 1998, with Fischer appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The existence of this group of languages is discussed on both linguistic and political bases.\n\n==Classification==\nAccording to some linguists both [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] should be considered [[Gallo-Romance languages]]. Other linguists concur as regarding Occitan but consider Catalan to be part of the [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romance languages]].\n\nThe issue at debate is as political as it is linguistic because the division into [[Gallo-Romance]] and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] stems from the current nation states of [[France]] and [[Spain]] and so is based more on territorial criteria than historic and linguistic criteria. One of the main proponents of the unity of the languages of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], and for a long time, others such as Swiss linguist [[Wilhelm Meyer-L\u00fcbke]] (''Das Katalanische'', Heidelberg, 1925) have supported the kinship of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].\n\nFrom the 8th century to the 13th century, there was no clear linguistic distinction between Occitania and Catalonia. For instance, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]]  [[troubadour]], [[Albertet de Sestaro|Albertet de Sestar\u00f3]], says: \"Monks, tell me which according to your knowledge are better: the French or the Catalans? and here I shall put Gascony, Provence, Limousin, Auvergne and Viennois while there shall be the land of the two kings.\"<ref>''Monges, causetz, segons vostre siensa qual valon mais, catalan ho franc\u00e9s?/ E met de sai Guascuenha e Proensa/ E lemoz\u00ed, alvernh\u2019 e vian\u00e9s/ E de lai met la terra dels dos reis.''</ref> In [[Marseille]], a typical Proven\u00e7al song is called 'Catalan song'.<ref name=\"Fontanals1861\">{{cite book|author=Manuel Mil\u00e1 y Fontanals|title=De los trovadores en Espa\u00f1a: Estudio de lengua y poes\u00eda provenzal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA14|year=1861|publisher=J.

[[Occitan language|Occitan]] languages spoken in parts of southern [[France]] and northeastern [[Spain]].<ref>\"Mas se confrontam los parlars naturals de Catalonha e d'Occitania, i a pas cap de dobte,

influence from the group.\n\n==Extent==\nThe group covers the languages of the southern part of [[France]] ([[Occitania]] including [[Northern Catalonia]]), eastern [[Spain]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[La Franja]], [[Carche]]), together with [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], parts of [[Italy]] ([[Occitan Valleys]], [[Alghero]], [[Guardia Piemontese]]), and historically in the [[County of Tripoli]] and the possessions of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The existence of this group of languages is discussed on both linguistic and political bases.\n\n==Classification==\nAccording to some linguists both [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] should be considered [[Gallo-Romance languages]]. Other linguists concur as regarding Occitan but consider Catalan to be part of the [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romance languages]].\n\nThe issue at debate is as political as it is linguistic because the division into [[Gallo-Romance]] and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] stems from the current nation states of [[France]] and [[Spain]] and so is based more on territorial criteria than historic and linguistic criteria. One of the main proponents of the unity of the languages of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], and for a long time, others such as Swiss linguist [[Wilhelm Meyer-L\u00fcbke]] (''Das Katalanische'', Heidelberg, 1925) have supported the kinship of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].\n\nFrom the 8th century to the 13th century, there was no clear linguistic distinction between Occitania and Catalonia. For instance, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]]  [[troubadour]], [[Albertet de Sestaro|Albertet de Sestar\u00f3]], says: \"Monks, tell me which according to your knowledge are better: the French or the Catalans? and here I shall put Gascony, Provence, Limousin, Auvergne and Viennois while there shall be the land of the two kings.\"<ref>''Monges, causetz, segons vostre siensa qual valon mais, catalan ho franc\u00e9s?/ E met de sai Guascuenha e Proensa/ E lemoz\u00ed, alvernh\u2019 e vian\u00e9s/ E de lai met la terra dels dos reis.''</ref> In [[Marseille]], a typical Proven\u00e7al song is called 'Catalan song'.<ref name=\"Fontanals1861\">{{cite book|author=Manuel Mil\u00e1 y Fontanals|title=De los trovadores en Espa\u00f1a: Estudio de lengua y poes\u00eda provenzal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA14|year=1861|publisher=J.

Bec]]\n[[File:Sumien supradialectal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Supradialectal classification of Occitano-Romance according to D. Sumien]]\nMost linguists separate Catalan and Occitan, but both languages have been treated as one in studies by Occitan linguists attempting to classify the dialects of Occitan in [[supradialectal]] groups, such is the case of [[Pierre Bec]]<ref>Pierre BEC (1973), ''Manuel pratique d\u2019occitan moderne'', coll.

PADF, a non-profit organization, has worked in every country in the region. PADF aims to bring together stakeholders to create sustainable economic development, strengthen civil society and respond to natural disasters for the most disadvantaged people in Latin America and the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.padf.org/ht/d/sp/i/29319/pid/29319 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009234203/http://www.padf.org/ht/d/sp/i/29319/pid/29319 |archivedate=2010-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nPADF, which also works to support the principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/OASpage/eng/Documents/Democractic_Charter.htm|title=Democratic Charter|website=www.oas.org}}</ref> is an independent affiliate of the OAS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|first=|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=www.oas.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe PADF was established in 1962, by the Organization of American States (OAS), as part of the [[Alliance for Progress]] initiated by U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. It was created through a cooperative agreement between the OAS and private enterprise to provide a specialized non-governmental organization to assist the least advantaged people in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since its creation, PADF has implanted development programs throughout the Western Hemisphere carrying out the goals set forth by the OAS.\n\nIn 1975, OAS named PADF a \u201cspecial purpose foundation\u201d achieving consultative status with the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.padf.org/pages/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106183350/http://www.padf.org/pages/history |archivedate=2013-01-06 }}</ref>\n\n==Programs==\nIn keeping with its mission to create \u201ca Hemisphere of Opportunity for All,\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padf.org/programs|title=Create Economic Opportunities|website=PADF}}</ref> PADF implements a range of different programs, reaching millions of people in Latin American and the Caribbean. The programs are divided into four areas of development.\n\n===Economic opportunity programs===\nPADF implements economic opportunity programs with the focus of improving the livelihoods of disadvantaged individuals and families. The programs include support for micro and medium-size businesses, skills training for youth and vulnerable groups, improving agricultural conditions and techniques, and expanding or improving local infrastructure.\n\n====LEAD program====\nIn 2012, PADF implemented the Leveraging Effective Application of Direct Investment (LEAD) program with $13 million in funding from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID). The LEAD program is a business plan competition which awards grants to small and medium enterprises. The grants range from $50,000 to $200,000 and must be matched be the grantee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-7939-haiti-economy-2nd-edition-of-business-plan-competition.html|title=Haiti - Economy : 2nd Edition of Business Plan Competition - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|website=haitilibre.com}}</ref>\n\nPADF announced the launch of the second edition of the LEAD Program on February 20, 2013. Following the launch of the second round, a group of Haitian businesses, which had been awarded LEAD grants, participated in a business and investment seminar at [[Columbia University]]. The event is part of a series of investment events and conferences that the businesses are participating in throughout the United States, Canada and the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/03/19/haiti-small-businesses-launch-road-show-tour-of-us-dominican-republic/|title=Haiti: Small Businesses Launch \"Road Show\" Tour of US, Dominican Republic|date=19 March 2013|website=caribjournal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Community and civil society programs===\nThroughout Latin America and the Caribbean, PADF partners with civil society organizations on programs intended to increase their capacity to respond to community needs. Civil society programming aims to enhance democratic values and empower communities and social entrepreneurs. It also promotes human rights, especially for Afro-descendants, indigenous and other vulnerable groups. Since its foundation in 1962, PADF has worked with thousands of civil society and community-based groups.\n\n===Social progress programs===\nPADF initiates programs, often with partnership from private corporations and donors, to confront social issues and strengthen communities in many Latin American and Caribbean nations. PADF has implemented programs aimed at community-driven development, improving infrastructure and housing, upgrading technical training and health services, aiding at-risk youth, and combating human trafficking, gang activities and violence.\n\n===Natural disaster programs===\nPADF works with local non-governmental organizations and communities to prepare for disasters, taking systematic precautions to reduce the risk of potential disasters. The programs are designed to lessen the impact of disasters and crises by: helping communities prepare for disasters; providing emergency relief; assisting disaster recovery, reconstruction and mitigation; strengthening community responses to natural disasters; supporting the Inter-American Committee for Disaster Reduction (IACDR); and aiding victims or humanitarian crises.\n\nPADF also responds to natural disasters and implements disaster relief programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. PADF has provided disaster relief assistance to communities in [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[St. Lucia]] and [[Venezuela]].\n\n====2010 Haiti earthquake response====\nOn January 12, 2010, an [[earthquake]] with a scale of 7.0 struck Haiti just 10 miles west of the capital, [[Port-au-Prince]]. According to Haitian government estimations, the earthquake killed or injured 616,000 people, damaged or destroyed 250,000 residences, and left 1,000,000 people homeless.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/world/haitians-angry-over-slow-aid-20100204-ng2g.html|title=Haitians angry over slow aid|last=Renois|first=Clarens|date=4 February 2010|website=The Age|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the disaster, PADF has helped assess the structural safety of more than 400,000 buildings, repaired more than 9,000 homes, and instituted more than 1,000 community development programs in what is the single largest effort in the organization's history.\n\n'''COVID-19 response'''\n\nFollowing the spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic, PADF\u2019s social media presence has been largely centered around of public education and awareness. Their posts showcase precautionary measures, dispelled myths regarding the virus, provision of mental health resources, and continuous acknowledgement of breakthroughs in international human rights and transitional justice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/padforg/|title=Pan American Development Fndtn (@padforg) profile on Instagram \u2022 485 posts|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Efforts include the creation and sharing of posters and related videos (including a hand-washing music video by Haitian artist BIC)<ref>\u201cLave Men Nou ( Kowonaviris/Kovid-19) .\u201d ''Youtube'', 7 Apr. 2020, youtu.be/QYEVuHXjfAM.</ref> in English, Haitian-Creole and Spanish for Latin American and Caribbean/ Haitian audiences. \n\nComplementary to their social media presence, PADF has taken initiative to start an emergency fund aimed towards assisting the 650 million people throughout Latin America and the Caribbean who are at risk to health-related, economic and social impacts of the pandemic. Moreover, with over 60 years of experience, sound financial resources, and strong affiliations with communities throughout these areas, PADF has been able to provide immediate assistance to urgent areas through mobile and e-vouchers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.padf.org/pressroom|title=Press Room|website=Pan American Development Foundation {{!}} PADF|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, PADF is supporting \"Dar una mano Ecuador\" (Give a Hand without Shaking Hands).

S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for a century and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister marries an engineer who works in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle kills himself.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for 100 years and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

'''[[Canola]]''' are a group of ''rapeseed'' [[cultivar]]s which were bred to have very low levels of [[erucic acid]] and are especially prized for use for human and animal food. ''Rapeseed'' is the third-largest source of [[vegetable oil]] and second-largest source of protein meal in the world.\n\n== Etymology and taxonomy ==\nThe term \"rape\" derives from the Latin word for [[turnip]], ''rapa'' or ''rapum'', cognate with the Greek word ''rhapys''.{{Sfn|OED|2016}}\n\nThe [[species]] ''Brassica napus'' belongs to the flowering plant family [[Brassicaceae]]. Rapeseed is a [[subspecies]] with the [[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]  ''B. napus ''subsp.'' napus''.{{Sfn|GRIN|2012a}} It encompasses winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} Siberian kale is a distinct leaf rape form [[Variety (botany)|variety]] (''B. napus ''var.'' pabularia'') which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable.{{Sfn|GRIN|2010b}}{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} The second subspecies of ''B. napus'' is [[rutabaga|''B. napus ''subsp.'' rapifera'']] (also subsp. ''napobrassica''; the rutabaga, swede, or yellow turnip).{{Sfn|GRIN|2012b}}{{Sfn|NCBI|2013}}\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brassica napus 2.jpg|thumb|Rapeseed blossoms]]\n\n''Brassica napus'' grows to {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} height with [[pinnatifid]] and [[glaucous]] lower leaves{{Sfn|Martin|1965}}{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}{{Sfn|Webb|Parnell|Doogue|1996}} and with the upper leaves clasping the stem. ''Brassica napus'' can be distinguished from ''[[Brassica nigra]]'' by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, and from ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' by its smaller petals which are less than {{convert|13|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}\n\nRapeseed flowers are yellow and about {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}} They are radial and consist of four [[petals]] in a typical cross-form, alternating with four [[sepals]]. They have indeterminate [[racemose]] flowering starting at the lowest bud and growing upward in the following days. The flowers have two lateral [[stamens]] with short filaments, and four median stamens with longer filaments whose anthers split away from the flower's center upon flowering.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nThe rapeseed pods are green and elongated [[Silique|siliquae]] during development that eventually ripen to brown. Each pod has two [[Locule|compartments]] separated by a inner central wall within which a row of oilseeds develop. The oilseeds are black and hard at maturity.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-2}}\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Northern Ireland, U K ''B. napus'' and ''B. rapa'' are recorded as escapes in roadside verges and waste ground.{{Sfn|Beesley|Wilde|1997|p=104}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Rapeseed, roasted.jpg|thumb|Roasted canola seeds]]\n\nRapeseed is grown for the production of [[compound feed|animal feed]], edible [[vegetable oils]], and [[biodiesel]]. Rapeseed was the third-leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after [[soybean]] and [[palm oil]].{{Sfn|USDA|2002|p=26}} It is the world's second-leading source of [[protein]] meal after soybean.{{Sfn|Heuz\u00e9|Tran|Sauvant|Lessire|2020}}\n\n=== Animal feed ===\nProcessing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=3}} Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.<ref>Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Top rapeseed producers in millions of [[tonnes]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?collection=Production.Crops.Primary&Domain=Production&servlet=1&hasbulk=0&version=ext&language=EN FAOSTAT].

'''[[Canola]]''' are a group of ''rapeseed'' [[cultivar]]s which were bred to have very low levels of [[erucic acid]] and are especially prized for use for human and animal food. ''Rapeseed'' is the third-largest source of [[vegetable oil]] and second-largest source of protein meal in the world.\n\n== Etymology and taxonomy ==\nThe term \"rape\" derives from the Latin word for [[turnip]], ''rapa'' or ''rapum'', cognate with the Greek word ''rhapys''.{{Sfn|OED|2016}}\n\nThe [[species]] ''Brassica napus'' belongs to the flowering plant family [[Brassicaceae]]. Rapeseed is a [[subspecies]] with the [[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]  ''B. napus ''subsp.'' napus''.{{Sfn|GRIN|2012a}} It encompasses winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} Siberian kale is a distinct leaf rape form [[Variety (botany)|variety]] (''B. napus ''var.'' pabularia'') which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable.{{Sfn|GRIN|2010b}}{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} The second subspecies of ''B. napus'' is [[rutabaga|''B. napus ''subsp.'' rapifera'']] (also subsp. ''napobrassica''; the rutabaga, swede, or yellow turnip).{{Sfn|GRIN|2012b}}{{Sfn|NCBI|2013}}\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brassica napus 2.jpg|thumb|Rapeseed blossoms]]\n\n''Brassica napus'' grows to {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} height with [[pinnatifid]] and [[glaucous]] lower leaves{{Sfn|Martin|1965}}{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}{{Sfn|Webb|Parnell|Doogue|1996}} and with the upper leaves clasping the stem. ''Brassica napus'' can be distinguished from ''[[Brassica nigra]]'' by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, and from ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' by its smaller petals which are less than {{convert|13|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}\n\nRapeseed flowers are yellow and about {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}} They are radial and consist of four [[petals]] in a typical cross-form, alternating with four [[sepals]]. They have indeterminate [[racemose]] flowering starting at the lowest bud and growing upward in the following days. The flowers have two lateral [[stamens]] with short filaments, and four median stamens with longer filaments whose anthers split away from the flower's center upon flowering.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nThe rapeseed pods are green and elongated [[Silique|siliquae]] during development that eventually ripen to brown. Each pod has two [[Locule|compartments]] separated by a inner central wall within which a row of oilseeds develop. The oilseeds are black and hard at maturity.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Northern Ireland, U K ''B. napus'' and ''B. rapa'' are recorded as escapes in roadside verges and waste ground.{{Sfn|Beesley|Wilde|1997|p=104}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Rapeseed, roasted.jpg|thumb|Roasted canola seeds]]\n\nRapeseed is grown for the production of [[compound feed|animal feed]], edible [[vegetable oils]], and [[biodiesel]]. Rapeseed was the third-leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after [[soybean]] and [[palm oil]].{{Sfn|USDA|2002|p=26}} It is the world's second-leading source of [[protein]] meal after soybean.{{Sfn|Heuz\u00e9|Tran|Sauvant|Lessire|2020}}\n\n=== Animal feed ===\nProcessing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=3}} Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|p=4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel.

She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old. She has stretched knees, pointed feet, and arms that float on clouds, her fingers perfectly placed. But still more important is her virtuosity, her connection with the public.

She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old.

Jackson was an original member of [[The Jackson 5]] and [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]], who rose to fame in the late 1960s and 1970s with the [[Motown Records|Motown]] label, and later recorded as a solo artist on the [[Columbia/Epic Label Group|Epic]] label in the late 1970s and 1980s. Tito is the third child in the [[Jackson family]].\n\n==Early life==\nToriano Adaryll Jackson was born the third of ten children in a black working-class family who lived in a three-room house in [[Gary, Indiana]]. His father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]], was a steel mill worker.  His mother, [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine]], was a devout [[Jehovah's Witness]]. At ten years of age, he was caught playing his father's guitar after he broke a string.<ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson| first = La Toya  | author2 = Patricia Romanowski  | title = [[La Toya: Growing up in the Jackson Family]] | publisher = [[New American Library]]  | year = 1991 | pages =  | isbn = 0-451-17415-1 }}</ref> After fixing the string, Joe demanded that his son play for him. Once he was finished, Jackson's father bought him his own guitar. Shortly thereafter, Joseph convinced Tito, Jackie, and Jermaine to form a singing group, having been impressed with the vocals of Jackie and Jermaine.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n{{main|The Jackson 5}}\nAfter first performing in school functions and supermarkets, the brothers began participating in local talent shows when Jackson was twelve. By then, his younger brother [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], then seven, had become the official lead singer of the group. In 1965, they changed their name from the Jackson Brothers to the Jackson Five, and won several talent shows around the Gary area. After winning the Amateur Night competition for [[The Apollo Theater]] in August 1967, Joe Jackson began to work part-time at the steel mill to help his sons secure a recording contract. The group signed with [[Steeltown Records]] in Gary, Indiana, in November of that year. In January 1968, the Jackson Five's first single, \"[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]],\" was released on the Steeltown label.<ref>[http://www.45rpmrecords.com/IN/Steeltown.php ''Big Boy'']; 45 RPM Records online; accessed June 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Jackson 5 signed with Motown Records in Detroit, and scored several hit songs, including the number-one singles \"[[I Want You Back]],\" \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]],\" \"[[The Love You Save]],\" and \"[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]].\" Although Tito sometimes added brief lead vocals on some songs, he and Marlon rarely sang background harmony with the other brothers until much later in their careers. Despite his talent as a guitar player, Motown refused to allow Tito to perform guitar on any of the Jackson 5 recording sessions, instead forcing all their guitar parts to be performed by session musicians. As a direct result, Tito's guitar work did not make its debut until he and the Jacksons left Motown for CBS Records in 1976. He also began writing songs with his brothers during this time. Throughout his tenure as a Jackson 5 and Jacksons member, Tito can be heard on many album recordings, such as \"Zippee Doo Da\" and \"Man Of War.\" Tito, along with Jackie, were the most consistently present members of the Jacksons, with Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Randy leaving at different times. After the end of the ''Victory Tour,'' Tito performed session work and as a record producer. After releasing ''[[2300 Jackson Street]],'' the Jacksons ceased recording work.\n\nAfter years managing his family group featuring his sons, [[3T]], Jackson returned to the national spotlight after reuniting with his brothers on Michael's 30th anniversary concert special at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\n===Solo work and other projects===\n[[File:Tito Jackson 2009-07-19.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.00|Jackson performing at the [[Motown]] 50th anniversary in [[Detroit]], 2009]]\n\nJackson began a solo career in 2003 performing as a [[blues music]]ian in various clubs with his band, which included producer and guitarist [[Angelo Earl]], and a management team that included Ed Tate.

Jackson was an original member of [[The Jackson 5]] and [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]], who rose to fame in the late 1960s and 1970s with the [[Motown Records|Motown]] label, and later recorded as a solo artist on the [[Columbia/Epic Label Group|Epic]] label in the late 1970s and 1980s. Tito is the third child in the [[Jackson family]].\n\n==Early life==\nToriano Adaryll Jackson was born the third of ten children in a black working-class family who lived in a three-room house in [[Gary, Indiana]]. His father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]], was a steel mill worker.  His mother, [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine]], was a devout [[Jehovah's Witness]]. At ten years of age, he was caught playing his father's guitar after he broke a string.<ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson| first = La Toya  | author2 = Patricia Romanowski  | title = [[La Toya: Growing up in the Jackson Family]] | publisher = [[New American Library]]  | year = 1991 | pages =  | isbn = 0-451-17415-1 }}</ref> After fixing the string, Joe demanded that his son play for him. Once he was finished, Jackson's father bought him his own guitar. Shortly thereafter, Joseph convinced Tito, Jackie, and Jermaine to form a singing group, having been impressed with the vocals of Jackie and Jermaine.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n{{main|The Jackson 5}}\nAfter first performing in school functions and supermarkets, the brothers began participating in local talent shows when Jackson was twelve. By then, his younger brother [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], then seven, had become the official lead singer of the group. In 1965, they changed their name from the Jackson Brothers to the Jackson Five, and won several talent shows around the Gary area. After winning the Amateur Night competition for [[The Apollo Theater]] in August 1967, Joe Jackson began to work part-time at the steel mill to help his sons secure a recording contract. The group signed with [[Steeltown Records]] in Gary, Indiana, in November of that year. In January 1968, the Jackson Five's first single, \"[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]],\" was released on the Steeltown label.<ref>[http://www.45rpmrecords.com/IN/Steeltown.php ''Big Boy'']; 45 RPM Records online; accessed June 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the Jackson 5 signed with Motown Records in Detroit, and scored several hit songs, including the number-one singles \"[[I Want You Back]],\" \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]],\" \"[[The Love You Save]],\" and \"[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]].\" Although Tito sometimes added brief lead vocals on some songs, he and Marlon rarely sang background harmony with the other brothers until much later in their careers. Despite his talent as a guitar player, Motown refused to allow Tito to perform guitar on any of the Jackson 5 recording sessions, instead forcing all their guitar parts to be performed by session musicians. As a direct result, Tito's guitar work did not make its debut until he and the Jacksons left Motown for CBS Records in 1976. He also began writing songs with his brothers during this time. Throughout his tenure as a Jackson 5 and Jacksons member, Tito can be heard on many album recordings, such as \"Zippee Doo Da\" and \"Man Of War.\" Tito, along with Jackie, were the most consistently present members of the Jacksons, with Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Randy leaving at different times. After the end of the ''Victory Tour,'' Tito performed session work and as a record producer. After releasing ''[[2300 Jackson Street]],'' the Jacksons ceased recording work.\n\nAfter years managing his family group featuring his sons, [[3T]], Jackson returned to the national spotlight after reuniting with his brothers on Michael's 30th anniversary concert special at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\n===Solo work and other projects===\n[[File:Tito Jackson 2009-07-19.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.00|Jackson performing at the [[Motown]] 50th anniversary in [[Detroit]], 2009]]\n\nJackson began a solo career in 2003 performing as a [[blues music]]ian in various clubs with his band, which included producer and guitarist [[Angelo Earl]], and a management team that included Ed Tate.
