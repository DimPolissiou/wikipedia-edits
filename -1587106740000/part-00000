He dropped out of [[Stuyvesant High School]] and served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]]. He received a bachelor's degree, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/|title=Thomas Sowell Articles \u2013 Political Columnist & Commentator|work=townhall.com}}</ref> from [[Harvard University]] in 1958 and a master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1959. In 1968, he earned his [[doctorate]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nSowell has served on the faculties of several universities, including [[Cornell University]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He has also worked for [[think tank]]s such as the [[Urban Institute]]. Since 1980, he has worked at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]]. He writes from a [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian conservative]] perspective, advocating [[supply-side economics]]. Sowell has written more than thirty books (a number of which have been reprinted in revised editions), and his work has been widely anthologized. He is a [[National Humanities Medal]] recipient for innovative scholarship which incorporated history, economics and political science.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSowell was born in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], near the border with South Carolina. His father died shortly before he was born, and his mother, a [[maid|housemaid]], already had four children. A great-aunt and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him.<ref name=\"courage\"/> In his autobiography, ''A Personal Odyssey,'' Sowell wrote that his childhood encounters with white people were so limited that he did not know that blond was a hair color.<ref>Sowell, ''A Personal Odyssey'', p. 6.</ref> When Sowell was nine, his family moved from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], to [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans from the South to the North for greater opportunities. He qualified for [[Stuyvesant High School]], a prestigious academic high school in New York City; he was the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade.

During his work, Sowell discovered an association between the rise of mandated minimum wages for workers in the sugar industry of [[Puerto Rico]] and the rise of [[unemployment]] in that industry. Studying the patterns led Sowell to theorize that the government employees who administered the minimum wage law cared more about their own jobs than the plight of the poor.<ref name=\"Salon\">{{cite web|last=Sawhill|first=Ray|url=http://www.salon.com/books/int/1999/11/10/sowell/ |title=Black and right |work=Salon.com |date=1999-11-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001007222000/http://salon.com/books/int/1999/11/10/sowell/print.html|archivedate=October 7, 2000}}</ref>\n\nSowell received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1968.<ref name=\"CV\"/> His dissertation was titled ''[[Say's Law]] and the [[general glut|General Glut]] Controversy''.<ref>{{cite thesis|author=Sowell, Thomas|title=Say's Law and the General Glut Controversy|url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4284259|type=PhD dissertation|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1968}}</ref> Sowell had initially chosen Columbia University to study under [[George Stigler]] (who would later receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]]).

Writing thirty years later about the 1969 \"violent\" takeover by black Cornell students of [[Willard Straight Hall]], Sowell characterized the students as \"hoodlums\" with \"serious academic problems [and] admitted under lower academic standards\" and noted \"it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca.\"<ref name=\"sowell19990503\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hoover.org/research/day-cornell-died | title=The Day Cornell Died | work=The Weekly Standard | date=1999-05-03 | accessdate=February 25, 2013 | author=Sowell, Thomas}}</ref>\n\nSowell has taught economics at Howard University, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], Cornell, [[Brandeis University]], [[Amherst College]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

Themes of Sowell's writing range from social policy on race, ethnic groups, education and decision-making, to classical and Marxian economics, to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.\n\nWhile often described as a [[Black conservatism in the United States|black conservative]], he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, \"I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that '[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement on a number of things\".<ref>Sawhill R.

Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'', in which, building on his earlier work, he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.\n\nHis book ''Knowledge and Decisions'', a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics centre Prize, was heralded as a \"landmark work\" and selected for this prize \"because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.\" In announcing the award, the centre acclaimed Sowell, whose \"contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/95113281/knowledge-and-decisions|title=Knowledge and Decisions by Thomas Sowell, 1996 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref> [[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote: \"In a wholly original manner [Sowell] succeeds in translating abstract and theoretical argument into highly concrete and realistic discussion of the central problems of contemporary economic policy.\"<ref>{{cite article|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|author-link=Friedrich Hayek|date=December 1981|title=The Best Book on General Economics in Many a Year|url=https://reason.com/1981/12/01/the-best-book-on-general-econo/|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|publisher=[[Reason Foundation]]|volume=13|pages=47\u201349}}</ref>\n\nSowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies, in ''The Economics and Politics of Race'' (1983), ''Ethnic America'' (1981), ''[[Affirmative Action Around the World]]'' (2004), and other books. He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are not unique, either in terms of American ethnic groups, or in terms of a rural proletariat struggling with disruption as it became urbanized, as discussed in his book ''Black Rednecks and White Liberals'' (2005).\n\nIn ''Affirmative Action Around the World''<ref name=\"hoover1\">{{cite web |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/8108 |title=Affirmative Action around the World &#124; Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110191859/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/8108 |archivedate=2011-01-10 }}</ref> Sowell holds that affirmative action covers most of the American population, particularly women, and has long since ceased to favor  blacks.\n\nSowell described his serious study of [[Karl Marx]] in his autobiography. He opposes [[Marxism]], providing a critique in his book ''Marxism: Philosophy and Economics'' (1985).\n\nSowell also favors [[drug decriminalization|decriminalization of all drugs]].<ref>Sowell, Thomas (1987); ''Compassion Versus Guilt, and Other Essays''; {{ISBN|0-688-07114-7}}.</ref>\n\n=== Books on other subjects ===\nIn ''Intellectuals and Race'' (2013), Sowell argues that [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point gap in contemporary black\u2013white IQ scores is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain ethnic white groups in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.\n\nSowell wrote ''The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late'', a follow-up to his ''Late-Talking Children'', discussing a condition he termed [[Einstein syndrome]]. This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with [[autism]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and [[Steven Pinker]], among others, in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures. He discusses late-talkers who developed prominent careers, such as physicists [[Albert Einstein]],<ref>[http://www.albert-einstein.org/article_handicap.html \"The Legend of the Dull-Witted Child Who Grew Up to Be a Genius\", The Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem]</ref> [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard Feynman]]; mathematician [[Julia Robinson]]; and musicians [[Arthur Rubinstein]] and [[Clara Schumann]]. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the [[brain]]. This may temporarily \"rob resources\" from neighboring functions such as language development. Sowell disagrees with [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s speculation that Einstein may have had [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref name=Einstein>{{cite book | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Sowell | last = Sowell | title = The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late | pages = [https://archive.org/details/einsteinsyndrome00sowe/page/89 89\u2013150] | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-465-08140-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/einsteinsyndrome00sowe/page/89 }}</ref>\n\n=== Columns ===\nSowell had a nationally syndicated column distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]] that was published in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Times]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'' and other major newspapers, as well as online on websites such as [[RealClearPolitics]], [[Townhall]], ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'', and the ''[[Jewish World Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell.html |title= Thomas Sowell |publisher=Jewish world review |date= 2009-11-06 |accessdate= 2011-05-30}}</ref>\n\nSowell comments on current issues, which include liberal [[media bias]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041012.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher= Town hall |date= 2004-03-12 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> judicial activism (while defending [[originalism]]);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsowell.com/judicial.htm |title= Judicial Activism Reconsidered | work = T Sowell |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041109.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2010-11-09 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041110.shtml |title= Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2004-11-10 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassf |title= Thomas Sowell |work= Conservative Columnists and Political Commentary |publisher= Townhall |accessdate= 2010-03-12 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611223459/http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassf/ |archivedate= 2011-06-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20050914.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2005-09-14 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref> [[intact dilation and extraction]] (commonly known as, and described in U.S. federal law as, partial-birth abortion);<ref>{{cite web |last= Sowell |first= Thomas |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2004/06/04/partial_truth_abortion |title= Thomas Sowell : 'Partial truth' abortion |publisher=Townhall |date= 2004-06-04 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> the [[minimum wage]]; [[universal health care]]; the tension between government policies, programs, and protections and familial autonomy; affirmative action; government<ref>{{cite web |title= International Book Award |url=http://www.getabstract.com/pages/0/web/BookAward.jsp|publisher= Get Abstract |accessdate= July 22, 2011}}</ref> [[bureaucracy]]; [[gun control]];<ref name= \"guncontrol\" /> militancy in [[U.S. foreign policy]]; the U.S. [[war on drugs]], and [[multiculturalism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/250190/cult-multiculturalism-thomas-sowell|title= The Cult of Multiculturalism |work=National Review Online |accessdate= 5 October 2014|date= 2010-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn a Townhall editorial, \"The Bush Legacy\", Sowell assessed President [[George W.

He has also worked for [[think tank]]s such as the [[Urban Institute]]. Since 1980, he has worked at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]]. He writes from a [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian conservative]] perspective, advocating [[supply-side economics]]. Sowell has written more than thirty books (a number of which have been reprinted in revised editions), and his work has been widely anthologized. He is a [[National Humanities Medal]] recipient for innovative scholarship which incorporated history, economics and political science.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSowell was born in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], near the border with South Carolina. His father died shortly before he was born, and his mother, a [[maid|housemaid]], already had four children. A great-aunt and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him.<ref name=\"courage\"/> In his autobiography, ''A Personal Odyssey,'' Sowell wrote that his childhood encounters with white people were so limited that he did not know that blond was a hair color.<ref>Sowell, ''A Personal Odyssey'', p. 6.</ref> When Sowell was nine, his family moved from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], to [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans from the South to the North for greater opportunities. He qualified for [[Stuyvesant High School]], a prestigious academic high school in New York City; he was the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade.

During his work, Sowell discovered an association between the rise of mandated minimum wages for workers in the sugar industry of [[Puerto Rico]] and the rise of [[unemployment]] in that industry.

Writing thirty years later about the 1969 \"violent\" takeover by black Cornell students of [[Willard Straight Hall]], Sowell characterized the students as \"hoodlums\" with \"serious academic problems [and] admitted under lower academic standards\" and noted \"it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca.\"<ref name=\"sowell19990503\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hoover.org/research/day-cornell-died | title=The Day Cornell Died | work=The Weekly Standard | date=1999-05-03 | accessdate=February 25, 2013 | author=Sowell, Thomas}}</ref>\n\nSowell has taught economics at Howard University, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], Cornell, [[Brandeis University]], [[Amherst College]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'', in which, building on his earlier work, he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.\n\nHis book ''Knowledge and Decisions'', a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics centre Prize, was heralded as a \"landmark work\" and selected for this prize \"because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.\" In announcing the award, the centre acclaimed Sowell, whose \"contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/95113281/knowledge-and-decisions|title=Knowledge and Decisions by Thomas Sowell, 1996 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref> [[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote: \"In a wholly original manner [Sowell] succeeds in translating abstract and theoretical argument into highly concrete and realistic discussion of the central problems of contemporary economic policy.\"<ref>{{cite article|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|author-link=Friedrich Hayek|date=December 1981|title=The Best Book on General Economics in Many a Year|url=https://reason.com/1981/12/01/the-best-book-on-general-econo/|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|publisher=[[Reason Foundation]]|volume=13|pages=47\u201349}}</ref>\n\nSowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies, in ''The Economics and Politics of Race'' (1983), ''Ethnic America'' (1981), ''[[Affirmative Action Around the World]]'' (2004), and other books. He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are not unique, either in terms of American ethnic groups, or in terms of a rural proletariat struggling with disruption as it became urbanized, as discussed in his book ''Black Rednecks and White Liberals'' (2005).\n\nIn ''Affirmative Action Around the World''<ref name=\"hoover1\">{{cite web |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/8108 |title=Affirmative Action around the World &#124; Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110191859/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/8108 |archivedate=2011-01-10 }}</ref> Sowell holds that affirmative action covers most of the American population, particularly women, and has long since ceased to favor  blacks.\n\nSowell described his serious study of [[Karl Marx]] in his autobiography. He opposes [[Marxism]], providing a critique in his book ''Marxism: Philosophy and Economics'' (1985).\n\nSowell also favors [[drug decriminalization|decriminalization of all drugs]].<ref>Sowell, Thomas (1987); ''Compassion Versus Guilt, and Other Essays''; {{ISBN|0-688-07114-7}}.</ref>\n\n=== Books on other subjects ===\nIn ''Intellectuals and Race'' (2013), Sowell argues that [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point gap in contemporary black\u2013white IQ scores is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain ethnic white groups in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.\n\nSowell wrote ''The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late'', a follow-up to his ''Late-Talking Children'', discussing a condition he termed [[Einstein syndrome]]. This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with [[autism]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and [[Steven Pinker]], among others, in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures. He discusses late-talkers who developed prominent careers, such as physicists [[Albert Einstein]],<ref>[http://www.albert-einstein.org/article_handicap.html \"The Legend of the Dull-Witted Child Who Grew Up to Be a Genius\", The Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem]</ref> [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard Feynman]]; mathematician [[Julia Robinson]]; and musicians [[Arthur Rubinstein]] and [[Clara Schumann]]. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the [[brain]]. This may temporarily \"rob resources\" from neighboring functions such as language development. Sowell disagrees with [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s speculation that Einstein may have had [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref name=Einstein>{{cite book | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Sowell | last = Sowell | title = The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late | pages = [https://archive.org/details/einsteinsyndrome00sowe/page/89 89\u2013150] | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-465-08140-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/einsteinsyndrome00sowe/page/89 }}</ref>\n\n=== Columns ===\nSowell had a nationally syndicated column distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]] that was published in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Times]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'' and other major newspapers, as well as online on websites such as [[RealClearPolitics]], [[Townhall]], ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'', and the ''[[Jewish World Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell.html |title= Thomas Sowell |publisher=Jewish world review |date= 2009-11-06 |accessdate= 2011-05-30}}</ref>\n\nSowell comments on current issues, which include liberal [[media bias]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041012.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher= Town hall |date= 2004-03-12 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> judicial activism (while defending [[originalism]]);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsowell.com/judicial.htm |title= Judicial Activism Reconsidered | work = T Sowell |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041109.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2010-11-09 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041110.shtml |title= Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2004-11-10 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassf |title= Thomas Sowell |work= Conservative Columnists and Political Commentary |publisher= Townhall |accessdate= 2010-03-12 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611223459/http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassf/ |archivedate= 2011-06-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20050914.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell |publisher= Townhall |date= 2005-09-14 |accessdate= 2010-03-12}}</ref> [[intact dilation and extraction]] (commonly known as, and described in U.S. federal law as, partial-birth abortion);<ref>{{cite web |last= Sowell |first= Thomas |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2004/06/04/partial_truth_abortion |title= Thomas Sowell : 'Partial truth' abortion |publisher=Townhall |date= 2004-06-04 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> the [[minimum wage]]; [[universal health care]]; the tension between government policies, programs, and protections and familial autonomy; affirmative action; government<ref>{{cite web |title= International Book Award |url=http://www.getabstract.com/pages/0/web/BookAward.jsp|publisher= Get Abstract |accessdate= July 22, 2011}}</ref> [[bureaucracy]]; [[gun control]];<ref name= \"guncontrol\" /> militancy in [[U.S. foreign policy]]; the U.S. [[war on drugs]], and [[multiculturalism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/250190/cult-multiculturalism-thomas-sowell|title= The Cult of Multiculturalism |work=National Review Online |accessdate= 5 October 2014|date= 2010-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn a Townhall editorial, \"The Bush Legacy\", Sowell assessed President [[George W.
