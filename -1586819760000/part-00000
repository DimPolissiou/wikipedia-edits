The current lighthouse stands at the north end of [[Anastasia Island]] and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governments<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf</ref> operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory</ref>\n\nThe current lighthouse  tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the '''St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc.''', a not-for-profit maritime museum. The museum is open to the public 360 days a year. Admission fees support continued preservation of the lighthouse and five other historic structures. Admissions and museum memberships also fund programs in [[maritime archaeology]], traditional wooden boatbuilding, and maritime education. The non profit mission is to \"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest port<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance</ref> as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Staugustine1824.JPG|thumb|left|The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824]]\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.  In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP).  LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lampmaritime.com/LAMP/About_LAMP/LAMP_about |title=About LAMP |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLAMP's founding Director was William \"Billy Ray\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005.

The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.  The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur [[Henry Flagler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/the-centerboard-schooner-wreck |title=Centerboard Schooner Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida [[First Coast]] region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods.  These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites.

The current lighthouse stands at the north end of [[Anastasia Island]] and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governments<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf</ref> operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory</ref>\n\nThe current lighthouse  tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the '''St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc.''', a not-for-profit maritime museum. The museum is open to the public 360 days a year. Admission fees support continued preservation of the lighthouse and five other historic structures. Admissions and museum memberships also fund programs in [[maritime archaeology]], traditional wooden boatbuilding, and maritime education. The non profit mission is to \"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest port<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance</ref> as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Staugustine1824.JPG|thumb|left|The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824]]\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.

LAMP archaeologists, along with volunteer and student divers, have documented and recovered a wide range of well-preserved artifacts, including numerous iron and copper cauldrons, pewter spoons and plates, an iron tea kettle, ceramic and glass fragments, belt and shoe buckles, a brass candlestick, bricks, a flintlock [[Queen Anne pistol]], three [[Brown Bess]] muskets (two of which were loaded, one with [[buck and ball]]), thousands of lead shot, military buttons (including one from a Royal Provincial unit and one from the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders]]), a cask of nails, tools and navigational equipment (including a sight from an [[octant (instrument)|octant]]), ship's hardware and rigging elements, the ship's lead deck pump, a bronze [[ship's bell]], a 4-pounder [[cannon]], and a 9-pounder [[carronade]], believed to be the second oldest in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/storm-wreck |title=Excavation of the Storm Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/lamp_archaeologists_raise_two.php |title=A Tale of Two Cannons |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/lamp_divers_discover_four_cann.php |title=LAMP Divers Discover Four Cannon and the Ship's Bell |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=February 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/great_press_coverage_for_cauld.php |title=Great Press Coverage for Cauldron Raising |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>A series of six papers on the excavation and analysis of the Storm Wreck are published in: Jordan, Brian; Nowak, Troy J.

This was the final British fleet to leave Charleston, and when it arrived between December 24 and 31, 1782, as many as sixteen vessels were lost on the sandbar in front of the St. Augustine inlet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/Storm%20Wreck/the-loyalist-influx |title=Historical Background: St. Augustine, the American Revolution, and the Loyalist Influx |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/all_work_and_some_play_in_joll_1.php |title=All Work (and Some Play) in Jolly Olde England |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> In 2015-2016 LAMP discovered three additional historic shipwrecks, and is currently excavating one of these that appears to date to the second half of the 18th century, the so-called \"Anniversary Wreck.\"\n\nLAMP has also excavated two historically significant 19th century wrecks: a wooden-hulled [[steamship]], and a centerboard [[schooner]].  The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.  The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur [[Henry Flagler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/the-centerboard-schooner-wreck |title=Centerboard Schooner Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida [[First Coast]] region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods.  These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites. Current work includes the implementation of the First Coast Maritime Archaeology Project, a comprehensive program of research and outreach focusing on the waters around St. Augustine and elsewhere in northeast Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/first-coast-maritime-archaeology-project |title=First Coast Maritime Archaeological Project |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  This project was partially funded from 2007-2009 and 2014-2019 by historic preservation grants awarded by the state of Florida.\n\n==Ghost stories==\n[[File:StAugustineLighthouse StairsLookingDown.jpg|thumb|right|Looking down the staircase of the lighthouse]]\nThe location is the subject of numerous ghost stories and supernatural legends, and the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum offers tickets for a number of \"Dark of the Moon\" ghost tours and ghost-themed private events to the public.

He was an English envoy at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415. In 1417 he was made [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|admiral of the fleet]].

In 1424 he was made [[Steward of the Household]] of the infant King Henry VI, and on 7 January 1425/6 was summoned by [[writ]] to Parliament as [[Baron Hungerford]]. The summons was continued to him until his death. Hungerford became [[Treasurer of England]] in succession to Bishop Stafford, when Bishop Beaufort's resignation of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] in March 1426-7 placed Gloucester in supreme power.

The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the [[monsoon]]s. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\n\nAs the [[Himalayas]] block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the [[Monsoon]] climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of [[jute]], [[tea]], [[rice]], and various vegetables in this region.\n\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:<ref name=olive1>John E. Olive, ''The Encyclopedia of World Climatology'', page 115-117, Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|9781402032646}}</ref>\n* The northern Indian edge and northern Pakistani uplands have a dry subtropical [[continental climate]]\n* The far south of India and southwest Sri Lanka have an [[equatorial climate]]\n* Most of the peninsula has a tropical climate with variations:\n** Hot [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate in northwest India\n** Cool winter hot [[tropical climate]] in Bangladesh\n** Tropical [[semi-arid climate]] in the center\n* The Himalayas have an [[Alpine climate]]\n\nMaximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in [[Khasi and Jaintia Hills]] and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%\u201330%.<ref name=olive1/> Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by [[monsoon]]s. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 83, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref> Two monsoon systems exist in the region:<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 76, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref>\n* The summer monsoon: Wind blows from southwest to most of the parts of the region. It accounts for 70%\u201390% of the annual precipitation.\n* The winter monsoon: Wind blows from the northeast. Dominant in Sri Lanka and Maldives.\n\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid-June). In the summer, the low pressures are centered over the [[Indus-Gangetic Plain]], and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coldest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the [[Tibetan Plateau]], low pressure over the [[Indus Valley]] deepens, and the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.<ref name=olive1/>\n\n=== Land and water area ===\n{{See also|Exclusive economic zone|Indian Ocean}}\nThis list includes [[dependent territories]] within their [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on [[Antarctica]].

The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia, such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, use the Arabic alphabet and Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]]. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from [[Brahmi script]] for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for [[Dravidian languages]] and others.<ref name=kachru122>{{cite book|author1=Braj B.

During the height of [[Cold war]], the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the [[United States|US]]. At the same time, India played crucial [[India and the Non-Aligned Movement|role]] informing the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and while maintaining goodwill relations with the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]].\n\nPakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan have become a concern for the South Asian region. In [[Nepal]], the government has struggled to come in the side of democracy, and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in [[Sri Lanka]] has been dominated by an increasingly assertive [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalism, and the emergence of a [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] separatist movement under [[LTTE]], which was suppressed in May 2009. [[Myanmar]]'s politics is dominated by a military [[Military junta|Junta]], which has sidelined the democratic forces led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Governance and education index rankings of South Asian countries\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!Afghanistan|| Bangladesh|| Bhutan || India || Maldives || Nepal || Pakistan || Sri Lanka\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Inequality-adjusted HDI (2018)<ref name=\"UNDP2019\"/> (''global ranking of 150'')\n|No data|| 101 || 107 || 99 || 87 || 112 || 120 || 54\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Corruption Perception Index (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019?/news/feature/cpi-2019|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  (''global ranking of 168'')\n|173|| 146 || 25 || 80 || 130 || 113 || 120 || 93\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | The Worldwide Governance<br />Indicators (2015)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|title=Worldwide Governance Indicators|date=2015|website=World Bank|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705084108/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|archive-date=5 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Government Effectiveness\n|8%|| 24% || 68% || 56% || 41% || 13% || 27% || 53%\n|-\n| Political stability and absence<br />of violence/terrorism\n|1%|| 11% || 89% || 17% || 61% || 16% || 1% || 47%\n|-\n| Rule of law\n|2%|| 27% || 70% || 56% || 35% || 27% || 24% || 60%\n|-\n| Voice and accountability\n|16%|| 31% || 46% || 61% || 30% || 33% || 27% || 36%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|Population below poverty line]] (2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|title=Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234751/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|35.8%|| 31.5% || 23.7% || 21.9%|| 16% || 25.2% || 21.4% || 8.9%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Primary School Enrollment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|title=School enrollment, primary (% net) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185547/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|29%||90%||85%||92%||94%||96%||73%||98%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Secondary School Enrollment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|title=Gross enrolment ratio, secondary, both sexes (%) \u2013 Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152545/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|archive-date=16 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|49%||54%||78%||68%||N/A||72%||38%||96%\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of South Asia|Index of South Asia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of South Asia]] -->\n* [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]]\n* [[Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in South Asia]]\n* ''[[South Asia Disaster Report]]''\n* [[South Asian cuisine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{citation|last1=Burnell|first1=P.

The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the [[monsoon]]s. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\n\nAs the [[Himalayas]] block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the [[Monsoon]] climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of [[jute]], [[tea]], [[rice]], and various vegetables in this region.\n\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:<ref name=olive1>John E.

South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 83, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref> Two monsoon systems exist in the region:<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 76, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref>\n* The summer monsoon: Wind blows from southwest to most of parts of the region. It accounts for 70%\u201390% of the annual precipitation.\n* The winter monsoon: Wind blows from northeast. Dominant in Sri Lanka and Maldives.\n\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the [[Indus-Gangetic Plain]] and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the [[Tibetan Plateau]], low pressure over the [[Indus Valley]] deepens and the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.<ref name=olive1/>\n\n=== Land and water area ===\n{{See also|Exclusive economic zone|Indian Ocean}}\nThis list includes [[dependent territories]] within their [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on [[Antarctica]].

The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]]. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only the Nastaliq script, but thereafter has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from [[Brahmi script]] for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for [[Dravidian languages]] and others.<ref name=kachru122>{{cite book|author1=Braj B.

During the height of [[Cold war]], the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the [[United States|US]], while India played crucial [[India and the Non-Aligned Movement|role]] informing the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and while maintaining goodwill relations with the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]].\n\nPakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan has become a concern for the South Asian region. In [[Nepal]], the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in [[Sri Lanka]] has been dominated by an increasingly assertive [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalism, and the emergence of a [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] separatist movement under [[LTTE]], which was suppressed in May 2009. [[Myanmar]]'s politics is dominated by a military [[Military junta|Junta]], which has sidelined the democratic forces led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Governance and education index rankings of South Asian countries\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!Afghanistan|| Bangladesh|| Bhutan || India || Maldives || Nepal || Pakistan || Sri Lanka\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Inequality-adjusted HDI (2018)<ref name=\"UNDP2019\"/> (''global ranking of 150'')\n|No data|| 101 || 107 || 99 || 87 || 112 || 120 || 54\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Corruption Perception Index (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019?/news/feature/cpi-2019|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  (''global ranking of 168'')\n|173|| 146 || 25 || 80 || 130 || 113 || 120 || 93\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | The Worldwide Governance<br />Indicators (2015)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|title=Worldwide Governance Indicators|date=2015|website=World Bank|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705084108/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|archive-date=5 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Government Effectiveness\n|8%|| 24% || 68% || 56% || 41% || 13% || 27% || 53%\n|-\n| Political stability and absence<br />of violence/terrorism\n|1%|| 11% || 89% || 17% || 61% || 16% || 1% || 47%\n|-\n| Rule of law\n|2%|| 27% || 70% || 56% || 35% || 27% || 24% || 60%\n|-\n| Voice and accountability\n|16%|| 31% || 46% || 61% || 30% || 33% || 27% || 36%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|Population below poverty line]] (2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|title=Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234751/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|35.8%|| 31.5% || 23.7% || 21.9%|| 16% || 25.2% || 21.4% || 8.9%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Primary School Enrollment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|title=School enrollment, primary (% net) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185547/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|29%||90%||85%||92%||94%||96%||73%||98%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Secondary School Enrollment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|title=Gross enrolment ratio, secondary, both sexes (%) \u2013 Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152545/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|archive-date=16 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|49%||54%||78%||68%||N/A||72%||38%||96%\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of South Asia|Index of South Asia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of South Asia]] -->\n* [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]]\n* [[Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in South Asia]]\n* ''[[South Asia Disaster Report]]''\n* [[South Asian cuisine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{citation|last1=Burnell|first1=P.

Clinton's decisive double-digit victory in the state, including a Democratic sweep of all 14 counties, represented a dramatic turnaround for a state that up to that point had been reliably Republican for over 130 years. This was only the second time in history that a Democratic presidential nominee had won Vermont's electoral votes, the first and only prior time being when [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] had carried the state in the [[1964 United States presidential election in Vermont|1964]] Democratic landslide. Except for 1964, Vermont had voted Republican in every presidential election from [[1856 United States presidential election in Vermont|1856]] to [[1988 United States presidential election in Vermont|1988]]. Beginning in 1992, however, Vermont instantly became a reliably Democratic state in presidential elections, voting Democratic in every election that has followed. \n\nVermont's sudden shift away from the GOP was largely a product of dramatic changes within the party itself. By the 1990s, the Republican Party, which once had a vibrant [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] wing, began to largely consist of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], [[Southern United States|Southerners]], and [[Christian right|Evangelical Christians]]. Consequently, Vermont, a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Irreligion|secular]] [[New England]] state, moved increasingly toward the Democratic Party and today is regarded as one of the safest of [[Red states and blue states|blue states]].\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1992 United States presidential election in Vermont<ref name=results>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results - Vermont|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1992&fips=50&f=0&off=0&elect=0&minper=0|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]'''\n| '''[[Bill Clinton]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''133,592'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''46.11%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''3'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| [[George H.
