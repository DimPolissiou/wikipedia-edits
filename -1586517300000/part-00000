{"title_page": "Seismic intensity scales", "text_new": "{{Earthquakes}}\n'''Seismic intensity scales''' categorize the intensity or severity of ground shaking (quaking) at a given location, such as resulting from an [[earthquake]]. They are distinguished from [[seismic magnitude scales]], which measure the magnitude or overall strength of an earthquake, which may, or perhaps not, cause perceptible shaking.\n\nIntensity scales are based on the observed effects of the shaking, such as the degree to which people or animals were alarmed, and the extent and severity of damage to different kinds of structures or natural features.  The maximal intensity observed, and the extent of the area where shaking was felt (see isoseismal map, below), can be used to estimate the location and magnitude of the source earthquake; this is especially useful for historical earthquakes where there is no instrumental record.\n\n==Ground shaking==\nGround shaking can be caused in various ways (volcanic tremors, avalanches, large explosions, etc.), but shaking intense enough to cause damage is usually due to rupturing of the earth's crust known as [[earthquakes]].  The intensity of shaking depends on several factors: \n* The \"size\" or strength of the source event, such as measured by various [[seismic magnitude scales]].\n* The type of [[seismic wave]] generated, and its orientation.\n* The depth of the event.\n* The distance from the source event.\n* [[Seismic site response|Site response]] due to local geology\nSite response is especially important as certain conditions, such as unconsolidated sediments in a basin, can amplify ground motions as much as ten times.\n\n[[File:1968 Illinois earthquake.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Isoseismal map for the [[1968 Illinois earthquake]], showing the extent of different levels of shaking. The irregularity of areas is due to ground conditions and the underlying geology.]]\nWhere an earthquake is not recorded on seismographs an [[isoseismal map]] showing the intensities felt at different areas can be used to estimate the location and magnitude of the quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|loc=\u00a73.1.2.1}}.</ref> Such maps are also useful for estimating the shaking intensity, and thereby the likely level of damage, to be expected from a future earthquake of similar magnitude. In Japan this kind of information is used when an earthquake occurs to anticipate the severity of damage to be expected in different areas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Doi|2010}}.</ref>\n\nThe intensity of local ground-shaking depends on several factors besides the magnitude of the earthquake,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|p=164 et seq.}}.</ref> one of the most important being soil conditions. For instance, thick layers of soft soil (such as fill) can amplify seismic waves, often at a considerable distance from the source, while sedimentary basins will often resonate, increasing the duration of shaking. This is why, in the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the Marina district of [[San Francisco]] was one of the most damaged areas, though it was nearly 100&nbsp;km from the epicenter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=170\u2013171}}.</ref> Geological structures were also significant, such as where seismic waves passing under the south end of San Francisco Bay reflected off the base of the Earth's crust towards San Francisco and Oakland. A similar effect channeled seismic waves between the other major faults in the area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|p=170}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\nThe first simple classification of earthquake intensity was devised by Domenico Pignataro in the 1780s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural Disasters|author=David Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=Domenico+Pignataro&source=bl&ots=KK1-lgBd0m&sig=l6DAPwlJqsbfNI_jbEqfLtTf-78&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nEhmT7PjFaKfiAK-9-yiDw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Domenico%20Pignataro&f=false|page=28|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-0-412-04741-1|year=1993|edition=First}}</ref>. The first recognisable intensity scale in the modern sense of the word was drawn up by P.N.G. Egen in 1828; it was ahead of its time.  However, The first modern mapping of an earthquake Intensities was made by [[Robert Mallet]], an Irish engineer who was sent by the Imperial College in London to make a research right after the [[(December) 1857 Basilicata Earthquake]], known also as [[The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857]]. But The first widely adopted intensity scale, the ''[[Rossi\u2013Forel scale]]'', was introduced in the late 19th century It was a 10 grades scale. In 1902. an Italian [[seismologist]] named [[Giuseppe Mercalli]], created a new 12 grades scale named after his name. A very significant improvement was echived, mainly by [[Charles Francis Richter]] during the 50's, when (1) a correlation was found between seismic Intensity and the [[Peak ground acceleraton]] - PGA (watch the equation that Richter found for California) <ref><math>\\log a = \\frac{I}{3}-0.5</math> where <math>a</math> is the PGA for that given site with value of (cm/sec<sup>2</sup>) and <math>I</math> is the Intensity value for that site. see: Charles F. Richter., 1958. Elementary Seismology. Freeman & Company, San Francisco & London, (Chapter 11) p.140.</ref>. (2) a definition of the strength of the buildings, and a subdevision into groups (calld type of buildings) was made. Then, the evaluation of the seismic intensity was based upon the dammage grade to a given type of structure. That gave the Mercalli Scale the quantitative element, which reprisents the vulnerability of the building's type <ref>\n Lapajne, J., 1984. The MSK-78 Intensity Scale and Seismic Risk. Engineering Geology, 20:pp.105-112</ref>. Since then, that scale was called the [[Modified Mercali Intensity Scale]] - MMS and the evaluations of the Seismic Intensities became more reliable<ref>\n Bolt, B.A., Earthquakes, F&C, 1988, pp.146-152 </ref>.  \n\n\nSince then numerous intensity scales have been developed and are used in different parts of the world.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"clear: right;\"\n|-\n!

They are distinguished from [[seismic magnitude scales]], which measure the magnitude or overall strength of an earthquake, which may, or perhaps not, cause perceptible shaking.\n\nIntensity scales are based on the observed effects of the shaking, such as the degree to which people or animals were alarmed, and the extent and severity of damage to different kinds of structures or natural features.  The maximal intensity observed, and the extent of the area where shaking was felt (see isoseismal map, below), can be used to estimate the location and magnitude of the source earthquake; this is especially useful for historical earthquakes where there is no instrumental record.\n\n==Ground shaking==\nGround shaking can be caused in various ways (volcanic tremors, avalanches, large explosions, etc.), but shaking intense enough to cause damage is usually due to rupturing of the earth's crust known as [[earthquakes]].  The intensity of shaking depends on several factors: \n* The \"size\" or strength of the source event, such as measured by various [[seismic magnitude scales]].\n* The type of [[seismic wave]] generated, and its orientation.\n* The depth of the event.\n* The distance from the source event.\n* [[Seismic site response|Site response]] due to local geology\nSite response is especially important as certain conditions, such as unconsolidated sediments in a basin, can amplify ground motions as much as ten times.\n\n[[File:1968 Illinois earthquake.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Isoseismal map for the [[1968 Illinois earthquake]], showing the extent of different levels of shaking. The irregularity of areas is due to ground conditions and the underlying geology.]]\nWhere an earthquake is not recorded on seismographs an [[isoseismal map]] showing the intensities felt at different areas can be used to estimate the location and magnitude of the quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bormann|Wendt|Di Giacomo|2013|loc=\u00a73.1.2.1}}.</ref> Such maps are also useful for estimating the shaking intensity, and thereby the likely level of damage, to be expected from a future earthquake of similar magnitude. In Japan this kind of information is used when an earthquake occurs to anticipate the severity of damage to be expected in different areas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Doi|2010}}.</ref>\n\nThe intensity of local ground-shaking depends on several factors besides the magnitude of the earthquake,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|p=164 et seq.}}.</ref> one of the most important being soil conditions. For instance, thick layers of soft soil (such as fill) can amplify seismic waves, often at a considerable distance from the source, while sedimentary basins will often resonate, increasing the duration of shaking. This is why, in the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the Marina district of [[San Francisco]] was one of the most damaged areas, though it was nearly 100&nbsp;km from the epicenter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=170\u2013171}}.</ref> Geological structures were also significant, such as where seismic waves passing under the south end of San Francisco Bay reflected off the base of the Earth's crust towards San Francisco and Oakland. A similar effect channeled seismic waves between the other major faults in the area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|p=170}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\nThe first simple classification of earthquake intensity was devised by Domenico Pignataro in the 1780s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural Disasters|author=David Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=Domenico+Pignataro&source=bl&ots=KK1-lgBd0m&sig=l6DAPwlJqsbfNI_jbEqfLtTf-78&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nEhmT7PjFaKfiAK-9-yiDw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Domenico%20Pignataro&f=false|page=28|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-0-412-04741-1|year=1993|edition=First}}</ref>. The first recognisable intensity scale in the modern sense of the word was drawn up by P.N.G. Egen in 1828; it was ahead of its time.  However, The first modern mapping of an earthquake Intensities was made by [[Robert Mallet]], an Irish engineer who was sent by the Imperial College in London to make a research right after the [[(December) 1857 Basilicata Earthquake]], known also as [[The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857]]. But The first widely adopted intensity scale, the ''[[Rossi\u2013Forel scale]]'', was introduced in the late 19th century It was a 10 grades scale. In 1902. an Italian [[seismologist]] named [[Giuseppe Mercalli]], created a new 12 grades scale named after his name. A very significant improvement was echived, mainly by [[Charles Francis Richter]] during the 50's, when (1) a correlation was found between seismic Intensity and the [[peak ground accelleraton]] - PGA (watch the equation that Richter found for California) <ref><math>\\log a = \\frac{I}{3}-0.5</math> where <math>a</math> is the PGA for that given site with value of (cm/sec<sup>2</sup>) and <math>I</math> is the Intensity value for that site. see: Charles F. Richter., 1958. Elementary Seismology. Freeman & Company, San Francisco & London, (Chapter 11) p.140.</ref>. (2) a definition of the strength of the buildings, and a subdevision into groups (calld type of buildings) was made. Then, the evaluation of the seismic intensity was based upon the dammage grade to a given type of structure. That gave the Mercalli Scale the quantitative element, which reprisents the vulnerability of the building's type <ref>\n Lapajne, J., 1984. The MSK-78 Intensity Scale and Seismic Risk. Engineering Geology, 20:pp.105-112</ref>. Since then, that scale was called the [[Modified Mercali Intensity Scale]] - MMS and the evaluations of the Seismic Intensities became more reliable<ref>\n Bolt, B.A., Earthquakes, F&C, 1988, pp.146-152 </ref>.  \n\n\nSince then numerous intensity scales have been developed and are used in different parts of the world.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"clear: right;\"\n|-\n!

It bills itself as the only regional party of the Uttarakhand in contrast to the national parties that dominate the state's politics.\n\nIn the present [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly]], elected in 2017, it does not have any member as compared with one member in the previous 2012, three members in 2007 and four members in 2002 assembly elections of the state.<ref>[[2017 Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election]]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Uttarakhand movement}}\n\nThe UKD was established on 26 July 1979 by [[Bipin Chandra Tripathi]], Dr. [[D. D. Pant]], [[Indramani Badoni]]\nand [[Kashi Singh Airy]] at [[Nanital]] to fight for a separate state composed of the hill districts of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The founding convention was chaired by Dr. D. D. Pant, former vice-chancellor of [[Kumaon University]]. Under the young leadership of Kashi Singh Airy who took the charge of struggle and public agitation and the aim was finally achieved, when the separate ''Uttaranchal'' state was formed on 9 November 2000, later renamed [[Uttarakhand]] in 2007. However, in the first ever state assembly elections in 2002, the party won only four out of 70 seats, and was outmaneuvered by the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], both despite being late comers to the separate state movement, succeeded in capturing its momentum for electoral gain and formed governments in the state {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nSo far, the UKD has not been able to achieve its ostensible goal in establishing a viable ''[[Third party (politics)|third force]]'' in Uttarakhand politics due to splits and divisions within its ranks. However, it maintains friendly relations with left parties in the state such as the [[Communist Party of India]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) Liberation]] and the other minor parties and social movements in Uttarakhand.\n\nThe party has taken on various campaigns in the past geared towards the social and economic upliftment of the [[Pahari people]]. The party has however embraced a number of causes of concern to the diversity of people living in Uttarakhand, defining the ''Uttarakhandi'' identity in broad and inclusive terms. As such, its ideology of civic as opposed to ethnic nationalism can be compared to other [[centre-left]] nationalist parties like the [[Scottish National Party]] or [[Plaid Cymru]], although its orientation and goals are emphatically non-secessionist.\n\n==Leadership==\nThe party's current face is [[Kashi Singh Airy]], a prominent leader of the Uttarakhand statehood movement and a senior leader of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, who was elected for [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] three times (1985\u20131989, 1989\u20131991, 1993\u20131996) and was elected for first [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly]]. [[Diwakar Bhatt]] is the current president of UKD, with Kashi Singh Airy and Dr. [[Narayan Singh Jantwal]] as honorary presidents, vice president are [[A. P. Juyal]], [[Bhuwan Chandra Joshi]], [[Beena Bahuguna]] and [[Pushpesh Tripathi]]\u2014senior statehood activists and prominent faces of Uttarakhand statehood movement who fought from the forefront in the creation of Uttarakhand state. Beena Bahuguna is now elected as a Block Pramukh of [[Raipur, Uttarakhand|Raipur]], [[Dehradun]]. [[Jaswant Singh Bisht]] was the first elected [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] of the party from [[Ranikhet (Uttarakhand Assembly constituency)|Ranikhet]] constituency. Other personalities include late [[Indramani Badoni]] and late [[Bipin Chandra Tripathi]] were the founding members and long time agitators for the separate state movement.\n\n== Factionism and decline ==\n{{Main|3rd Uttarakhand Assembly}}\nIn the [[2012 Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election|2012 Uttarakhand Assembly election]], Uttarakhand Kranti Dal contested as '''Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (P)''' led by then party president [[Trivendra Singh Panwar]]. The original party name and the election symbol (chair) was frozen by the [[Election Commission of India]] following the factionism and leadership dispute within the party that led to its breakup.\nThe splinter group '''Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (D)''' led by former [[Member of the  Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] and [[Uttarakhand Council of Ministers|Cabinet Minister]] in the [[First Khanduri ministry|Khanduri government]] and later [[Pokhriyal ministry|Pokhriyal government]], [[Diwakar Bhatt]] broke away from the UKD with his supporters claiming the original party leadership.\n[[Pritam Singh Panwar]] was the only winning candidate of the party in the 2012 Assembly election, who ran under the UKD(P) banner.\n\nUttarakhand Kranti Dal's original name and party symbol was restored in 2017 with the merger of both groups.\n\nThe party's performance in various assembly and parliamentary elections has been on consistent decline.

It bills itself as the only regional party of the Uttarakhand in contrast to the national parties that dominate the state's politics.\n\nIn the present [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly]], elected in 2017, it does not have any member as compared with one member in the previous 2012, three members in 2007 and four members in 2002 assembly elections of the state.<ref>[[2017 Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election]]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Uttarakhand movement}}\n\nThe UKD was established on 26 July 1979 by [[Bipin Chandra Tripathi]], Dr. [[D. D. Pant]], [[Indramani Badoni]]\nand [[Kashi Singh Airy]] at [[Nanital]] to fight for a separate state composed of the hill districts of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The founding convention was chaired by Dr. D. D. Pant, former vice-chancellor of [[Kumaon University]]. Under the young leadership of Kashi Singh Airy who took the charge of struggle and public agitation and the aim was finally achieved, when the separate ''Uttaranchal'' state was formed on 9 November 2000, later renamed [[Uttarakhand]] in 2007. However, in the first ever state assembly elections in 2002, the party won only four out of 70 seats, and was outmaneuvered by the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], both despite being late comers to the separate state movement, succeeded in capturing its momentum for electoral gain and formed governments in the state {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nSo far, the UKD has not been able to achieve its ostensible goal in establishing a viable ''[[Third party (politics)|third force]]'' in Uttarakhand politics due to splits and divisions within its ranks. However, it maintains friendly relations with left parties in the state such as the [[Communist Party of India]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) Liberation]] and the other minor parties and social movements in Uttarakhand.\n\nThe party has taken on various campaigns in the past geared towards the social and economic upliftment of the [[Pahari people]]. The party has however embraced a number of causes of concern to the diversity of people living in Uttarakhand, defining the ''Uttarakhandi'' identity in broad and inclusive terms. As such, its ideology of civic as opposed to ethnic nationalism can be compared to other [[centre-left]] nationalist parties like the [[Scottish National Party]] or [[Plaid Cymru]], although its orientation and goals are emphatically non-secessionist.\n\n==Leadership==\nThe party's current face is [[Kashi Singh Airy]], a prominent leader of the Uttarakhand statehood movement and a senior leader of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, who was elected for [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] three times (1985\u20131989, 1989\u20131991, 1993\u20131996) and was elected for first [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly]]. [[Diwakar Bhatt]] is the current president of UKD, with Kashi Singh Airy and Dr. [[Narayan Singh Jantwal]] as honorary presidents, vice president are [[A. P. Juyal]], [[Bhuwan Chandra Joshi]], [[Beena Bahuguna]] and [[Pushpesh Tripathi]]\u2014senior statehood activists and prominent faces of Uttarakhand statehood movement who fought from the forefront in the creation of Uttarakhand state. Beena Bahuguna is now elected as a Block Pramukh of [[Raipur, Uttarakhand|Raipur]], [[Dehradun]]. [[Jaswant Singh Bisht]] was the first elected [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] of the party from [[Ranikhet (Uttarakhand Assembly constituency)|Ranikhet]] constituency. Other personalities include late [[Indramani Badoni]] and late [[Bipin Chandra Tripathi]] were the founding members and long time agitators for the separate state movement.\n\n== Factionism and decline ==\n{{Main|3rd Uttarakhand Assembly}}\nIn the [[2012 Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election|2012 Uttarakhand Assembly election]], Uttarakhand Kranti Dal contested as '''Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (P)''' led by then party president [[Trivendra Singh Panwar]]. The original party name and the election symbol (chair) was frozen by the [[Election Commission of India]] following the factionism and leadership dispute within the party that led to its breakup.\nThe splinter group '''Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (D)''' led by former [[Member of the  Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] and [[Uttarakhand Council of Ministers|Cabinet Minister]] in the [[First Khanduri ministry|Khanduri government]] and later [[Pokhriyal ministry|Pokhriyal government]], [[Diwakar Bhatt]] broke away from the UKD with his supporters claiming the original party leadership.\n[[Pritam Singh Panwar]] was the only winning candidate of the party in the 2012 Assembly election, who ran under the UKD(P) banner.\n\nUttarakhand Kranti Dal's original name and party symbol was restored in 2017 with the merger of both groups.\n\nThe party's performance in various assembly and parliamentary elections has been on consistent decline. The main reasons cited for UKD's decline in the politics of Uttarakhand are; inner factionism, loss of voter base to other parties and frequent switching for power share between the BJP and Congress governments, which is often viewed negatively as a political opportunism.\n\n== Electoral performance in Uttarakhand==\n{{Main|Elections in Uttarakhand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
