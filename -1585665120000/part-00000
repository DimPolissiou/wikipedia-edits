The album was largely co-written by Little Mix, who stated that they were more involved in the development of this album than with their debut. Sonically, the album retains the [[pop music|pop]] sound of their debut album.\n\nThe album debuted at number seven in the [[Irish Albums Chart]] and number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was released in the US on 4 February 2014. The album became their second top ten in North America, debuting at number six on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and selling an estimated 40,414 copies in its first week.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\", made its radio premiere on 23 September 2013 and was released on 3 November 2013. It charted at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number five on the [[Irish Singles Chart]].

It was released in the US on 4 February 2014.

Hammond''' (born c. 1930s; sometimes credited as '''P. J. Hammond''') is a British television writer and novelist.\n\n==Career==\n\nHammond's television career began in the 1960s, when he began by working on [[BBC]] police dramas such as ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' and ''[[Z-Cars]]'', on the latter of which he served as [[script editor]] for a year from 1969 to 1970. In 1970 he also wrote for the fantasy series ''[[Ace of Wands (TV series)|Ace of Wands]]'', and later in the decade contributed to the soap opera ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]''. He also continued to write for crime and police dramas, penning episodes of ''[[The Sweeney]]''. He also created the offbeat 1984 sitcom ''[[Lame Ducks (TV series)|Lame Ducks]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hammond wrote for popular ITV police/detective shows ''[[The Gentle Touch]]'', ''[[The Bill]]'' and ''[[Wycliffe (television)|Wycliffe]]'', as well as for ''[[Dr. Finlay|Doctor Finlay]]'', the new production of the 1960s [[BBC]] series ''Dr. Finlay's Casebook''. He returned to the science fiction genre by writing an episode of the 1998 [[Sky One]] series ''[[Space Island One]]'', although his episode was ultimately one of those that went untransmitted until 2002.\n\nWork in the 2000s included many episodes of the popular murder mystery series ''[[Midsomer Murders]]''.\n\n===''Sapphire & Steel''===\nHe is best known for the creation of the [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] [[fantasy]] series ''[[Sapphire & Steel]]''<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://jpd.ch.man.ac.uk:80/Fiction/SnS/interviews/hammond.html\n | title =P.

His story, titled ''Paradise Five'', was liked by then-script editor [[Eric Saward]], but rejected by producer [[John Nathan-Turner]], and did not go beyond the outline stage. The script was later revived in 2009\u20132010 by [[Big Finish Productions]] for a full cast audio drama starring the [[Sixth Doctor]], [[Colin Baker]],<ref name=ogbf>[http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkFApZVFEZUwqwMVEE&tmpl=newsrss&style=feedstyle Galifrey One \u2013 Big Finish Announces Details of Lost Season]</ref> as part of the \"Lost Stories\" season featuring several commissioned, but never filmed, scripts.<ref name=bflost>[http://www.bigfinish.com/news/Lost-Stories-Titles-Almost-Announced!

His episode, \"[[Small Worlds (Torchwood)|Small Worlds]]\", was shown on 12 November 2006, directly opposite one of his ''Midsomer Murders'' scripts, \"Dance with the Dead\", on [[ITV1]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He also wrote the episode \"[[From Out of the Rain]]\" for the second series of ''Torchwood'', shown on BBC Three on 12 March 2008.\n\n==Novel==\nIn 2018 Hammond released his first novel, Downtimers. <ref name=\"Downtimers\">[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Downtimers-P-J-Hammond/dp/1999968506/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp&qid=1546808300&amp&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=anorakzonecom-21&linkId=2dbab8f269338568e1f3d9197b2c7f0c&language=en_GB  PJ Hammond - Downtimers]</ref>.\n\n==Writing credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

In 1970 he also wrote for the fantasy series ''[[Ace of Wands]]'', and later in the decade contributed to the soap opera ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]''. He also continued to write for crime and police dramas, penning episodes of ''[[The Sweeney]]''. He also created the offbeat 1984 sitcom ''[[Lame Ducks (TV series)|Lame Ducks]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hammond wrote for popular ITV police/detective shows ''[[The Gentle Touch]]'', ''[[The Bill]]'' and ''[[Wycliffe (television)|Wycliffe]]'', as well as for ''[[Dr. Finlay|Doctor Finlay]]'', the new production of the 1960s [[BBC]] series ''Dr. Finlay's Casebook''. He returned to the science fiction genre by writing an episode of the 1998 [[Sky One]] series ''[[Space Island One]]'', although his episode was ultimately one of those that went untransmitted until 2002.\n\nWork in the 2000s included many episodes of the popular murder mystery series ''[[Midsomer Murders]]''.\n\n===''Sapphire & Steel''===\nHe is best known for the creation of the [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] [[fantasy]] series ''[[Sapphire & Steel]]''<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://jpd.ch.man.ac.uk:80/Fiction/SnS/interviews/hammond.html\n | title =P.

Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]] from 28 November to 1 December 1943, after the [[Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran]]. It was held in the [[Soviet Union]]'s embassy in [[Tehran]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]]. It was the first of the [[List of World War II conferences|World War II conferences]] of the \"Big Three\" [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders (the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]). It closely followed the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] which had taken place on 22\u201326 November 1943, and preceded the 1945 [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] conferences. Although the three leaders arrived with differing objectives, the main outcome of the Tehran Conference was the Western Allies' commitment to open a [[Western Front (World War II)|second front]] against [[Nazi Germany]]. The conference also addressed the 'Big Three' Allies' relations with [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], operations in [[Yugoslavia]] and against [[Japan]], and the envisaged post-war settlement. A separate protocol signed at the conference pledged the Big Three to recognize Iran's independence.\n\n==Prelude==\nAs soon as the [[Operation Barbarossa|German-Soviet war]] broke out in June 1941, Churchill offered assistance to the Soviets, and an agreement to this effect was signed on 12 July 1941.<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\">{{cite book| last = Service| first = Robert| date = 2005| title = Stalin: A Biography| publisher = Harvard University Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-674-01697-2| pages = [https://archive.org/details/stalinbiography00serv_0/page/459 459\u201360]| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/stalinbiography00serv_0/page/459}}</ref> However, Churchill in a spoken radio transmission announcing the alliance with the USSR, reminded listeners that this alliance would not change his stance against communism.<ref> Bushkovitch, Paul.

A [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] committee was created to coordinate British and American operations as well as their support to the Soviet Union. The consequences of a global war, the absence of a unified Allied strategy and the complexity of allocating resources between Europe and Asia had not yet been sorted out, and soon gave rise to mutual suspicions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\" /> There was the question of opening a second front to alleviate the German pressure on the Soviet [[Red Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the question of mutual assistance (where both Britain and the Soviet Union were looking towards the United States for credit and material support and there was tension between the United States and Britain since Washington had no desire to prop up the [[British Empire]] in the event of an Allied victory).<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\" /> Also, neither the United States nor Britain were prepared to give Stalin a free hand in [[Eastern Europe]] and, lastly, there was no common policy on how to deal with Germany after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

Up to this point Churchill had advocated the expansion of joint operations of British, American, and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] forces in the Mediterranean, as opening a new western front had been physically impossible due to a lack of existing shipping routes, leaving the Mediterranean and Italy as viable goals for 1943. It was agreed Operation Overlord would be launched by American and British forces by May 1944 and that Stalin would support the Allies with a concurrent major offensive on Germany's eastern front ([[Operation Bagration]]) to divert German forces from northern France.<ref name=USDOS>{{cite web|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/tehran-conf|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdditional offensives were also discussed to compliment the undertaking of Operation Overlord, including the possible allied invasion of southern France prior to the landings at Normandy with the goal of drawing German forces away from the northern beaches and even a possible strike at the northern tip of the Adriatic to circumvent the Alps and drive towards Vienna. Either plan would have relied on Allied divisions engaged against the German army in Italy at the time of the conference.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Churchill, Winston S.|title=Closing the Ring : the Second World War, Volume 5.|date=2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1142-0|oclc=988869581}}</ref>\n\n[[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and [[Turkey]] were discussed in detail. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin all agreed to support Iran's government, as addressed in the following declaration:\n\n{{quote |The Three Governments realize that the war has caused special economic difficulties for Iran, and they all agreed that they will continue to make available to the Government of Iran such economic assistance as may be possible, having regard to the heavy demands made upon them by their world-wide military operations, and to the world-wide shortage of transport, raw materials, and supplies for civilian consumption.<ref>Declaration of the Three Powers Regarding Iran \u2013 1 December 1943</ref>}}\n\nIn addition, the Soviet Union was required to pledge support to Turkey if that country entered the war. Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed that it would also be most desirable if Turkey entered on the Allies' side before the year was out.\n\nDespite accepting the above arrangements, Stalin dominated the conference. He used the prestige of the Soviet victory at the [[Battle of Kursk]] to get his way. Roosevelt attempted to cope with Stalin's onslaught of demands, but was able to do little except appease Stalin. Churchill argued for the invasion of Italy in 1943, then Overlord in 1944, on the basis that Overlord was physically impossible in 1943 due to lack of shipping and it would be unthinkable to do anything major until it could be launched.<ref>McNeill, ''American, Britain and Russia'' (1953). p. 353.</ref>\n\nChurchill proposed to Stalin a moving westwards of Poland, which Stalin accepted, which gave the Poles industrialized German land to the west and gave up marshlands to the east, while providing a territorial buffer to the Soviet Union against invasion. Churchill's plan involved a border along the Oder and the [[Eastern Neisse]], giving Poland a fair compensation for the [[Eastern Borderlands]] in Churchill's view. <ref> {{cite book|title=\"Westverschiebung\" und \"Umsiedlung\" - Kriegsziele der Alliierten oder Postulat polnischer Politik?|author= Michael A. Hartenstein|lang=de}} </ref>\n\n===Dinner meeting===\nBefore the Tripartite Dinner Meeting of 29 November 1943 at the Conference, Churchill presented Stalin with a specially commissioned ceremonial sword (the \"[[Sword of Stalingrad]]\", made in [[Sheffield]]), as a gift from King [[George VI]] to the citizens of Stalingrad and the Soviet people, commemorating [[Battle of Stalingrad|the Soviet victory at Stalingrad]]. When Stalin received the sheathed sword, he took it with both hands and kissed the scabbard.

He said that only war criminals should be put on trial in accordance with the [[Moscow Declaration#Declaration on Atrocities|Moscow Document]], which he himself had written. He stormed out of the room, but was brought back in by Stalin who said he was joking.

Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt addressed the issue of Iran's special financial needs during the war, and the possibility of needing aid after the war. The three powers declared to continue to render aid to Iran. The Government of Iran and the three powers reach an accord within all the disagreements to maintain the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Iran. The United States, USSR, and the United Kingdom expect Iran to follow along with the other allied nations to establish peace once the war is over, this is what was agreed upon once the declaration was made.\n\n'''Conclusions:'''\n\n# The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] also known as [[National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia]] should be supported by supplies and equipment to the maximum extent and also by [[commando]] operations.\n# The leaders exclaimed that it would be desirable if Turkey should come into war on the side of the Allies before the end of the year.\n# The leaders took note of Stalin's statement that if Turkey found herself at war with Germany, and as a result Bulgaria declared war on Turkey or attacked her, the Soviet Union would immediately be at war with Bulgaria. The Conference further took note that this could be mentioned in the forthcoming negotiations to bring Turkey into the war.\n#The cross-channel invasion of France ([[Operation Overlord]]) would be launched during May 1944, in conjunction with an operation against southern France ([[Operation Dragoon]]). The latter operation would be undertaken in as great a strength as the availability of landing-craft permitted. The Conference further took note of Joseph Stalin's statement that the Soviet forces would launch an offensive ([[Operation Bagration]]) at about the same time with the object of preventing the German forces from transferring from the Eastern to the Western Front. Overlord was to be on 1 June, but because of the moon and tides required it slipped to 5 June.<ref> *{{cite book |last= Caddick-Adams  |first=  Peter |title= Sand & Steel: A New History of D-Day |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2019 |publisher= Hutchinson |location= London |isbn= 978-1-84794-8-281 |oclc= |page= 339 }} </ref> \n# The leaders agreed that the military staffs of the Three Powers should keep in close touch with each other in regard to the impending operations in Europe. In particular it was agreed that a cover plan to mislead the enemy about these operations should be concerted between the staffs concerned.\n\n'''Political decisions:'''\n\nStalin and Churchill discussed the future borders of Poland and settled on the Curzon line in the east and the Oder-Eastern Neisse line in the west. FDR had asked to be excused from any discussion of Poland out of consideration for the effects of any decision on Polish voters in the USA and the upcoming 1944 election. This decision was not ratified until the [[Potsdam Conference]] of 1945.\n\nDuring the negotiations at the Tehran Conference, Roosevelt secured the reincorporation of the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet Union only after the citizens voted on these actions. Stalin would not consent to any international control over the elections, and that all issues would have to be resolved in accordance with the Soviet Constitution.\n\n==Results==\nThe Yugoslav Partisans were given full Allied support, and Allied support to the Yugoslav [[Chetniks]] was halted (they were believed to be cooperating with the occupying Germans rather than fighting them); see [[Yugoslavia and the Allies]].  \n\nThe Communist Partisans under [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] took power in Yugoslavia as the Germans gradually retreated from the Balkans in 1944\u201345.<ref>McNeill, ''America, Britain, and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941\u20131946'' (1953) 388\u201390</ref>\n\nTurkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in November 1943, and promised to enter the war when his country was fully armed. By August 1944 Turkey broke off relations with Germany. In February 1945, Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan, which may have been a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations.<ref>Erik J.

This decision may be the most critical to come out of this conference, as the desired effect of the relief of Soviet troops was achieved, leading to a Soviet rally and advance toward Germany, a tide Hitler could not stem.\n\n=== United Nations ===\n\nThe Tehran Conference also served as one of the first conversations surrounding the formation of the [[United Nations]]. President Roosevelt first introduced Stalin to the idea of an international organization comprising all nation states, a venue for the resolution of common issues, and a check against international aggressors. With Germany having thrust the world into chaos for the second time in as many generations, the three world leaders all agreed that something must be done to prevent a similar occurrence.<ref name=\":2\">Roberts, Geoffrey (Fall 2007). \"Stalin at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences\".

During one dinner, Churchill questioned Stalin on his postwar territorial ambitions, to which Stalin replied \"There is no need to speak at this present time about any Soviet Desires, but when the time comes we will speak\".\n\n=== Soviet entry into the Pacific War ===\nOn 29 November, Roosevelt asked Stalin five questions about data and intelligence relating to Japanese and Siberian ports, and about air bases in the Maritime Provinces for up to 1,000 heavy bombers. On 2 February, Stalin told the American ambassador that America could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan (Vladivostok is in the Russian Far East, not Siberia).<ref> {{cite book |last= Ehrman |first= John |title= Grand Strategy Volume V, August 1943-September 1944 |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1956 |publisher= HMSO (British official history) |location= London |isbn= |oclc= |pages= 429,430}} </ref>\n\n==Alleged assassination plot==\n{{main|Operation Long Jump}}\nAccording to Soviet reports, German agents planned to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference, but called off the [[assassination]] while it was still in the planning stage. The [[NKVD]], the USSR's counterintelligence unit, first notified Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of security, of the suspected assassination plot several days prior to Roosevelt's  arrival in Tehran. Reilly had gone to Tehran several days early to evaluate security concerns and explore potential routes from Cairo to Tehran. Just before Reilly returned to Cairo, the [[NKVD]] informed him that dozens of Germans had been dropped into Tehran by parachute the day before. The [[NKVD]] suspected German agents were planning to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Summit at Tehran|last=Eubank|first=Keith|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York|pages=170\u2013173}}</ref>\n\nWhen housing accommodations for the meeting were originally discussed, both Stalin and Churchill had extended invitations to Roosevelt, asking him to stay with them during the meeting. However, Roosevelt wanted to avoid the appearance of choosing one ally over another and decided it was important to stay at the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|American legation]] to remain independent.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Eureka Summit: Agreement in Principle and the Big Three at Tehran, 1943|last=Mayle|first=Paul|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1987|isbn=|location=London and Toronto|pages=57\u201359}}</ref> Roosevelt arrived in Tehran on 27 November 1943 and settled into the American legation. Close to midnight, [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Vyacheslov Molotov]], Stalin's top aide, summoned [[Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel|Archibald Clark-Kerr]] (the British Ambassador in the Soviet Union) and [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]] (the American Ambassador in the Soviet Union) to the Soviet embassy, warning them of an assassination plot against Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Molotov informed them several assassins had been apprehended, but reported additional assassins were at large and expressed concerns for President Roosevelt's safety. Molotov advised Roosevelt should be moved to the safety of the British or Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmericans suspected Stalin had fabricated the assassination plot as an excuse to have Roosevelt moved to the Soviet embassy. Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of Secret Service, advised him to move to either the Soviet or British embassies for his safety. One of the underlying factors influencing their decision was the distance Churchill and Stalin would need to travel for meetings at the American legation. Harriman reminded the President that the Americans would be held responsible if Stalin or Churchill were assassinated while traveling to visit Roosevelt all the way across the city.<ref name=\":0\" /> Earlier that day, Molotov had agreed to hold all meetings at the American legation because traveling was difficult for Roosevelt. The timing of Molotov announcing an assassination plot later that night aroused suspicion that his motives were to keep Stalin safely within the guarded walls of the Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Harriman doubted the existence of an assassination plot, but urged the President to relocate to avoid the perception of putting Churchill and Stalin in danger. Roosevelt did not believe there was a credible threat of assassination, but agreed to the move so he could be closer to Stalin and Churchill.<ref name=\":0\" /> Living in the Soviet embassy also allowed Roosevelt to gain more direct access to Stalin and build his trust. Stalin liked having Roosevelt in the embassy because it eliminated the need to travel outside the compound and it allowed him to spy on Roosevelt more easily. The Soviet embassy was guarded by thousands of secret police and located adjacent to the British embassy, which allowed the Big Three to meet securely.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the Tehran Conference ended, Harriman asked Molotov whether there was really ever an assassination threat in Tehran. Molotov said that they knew about German agents in Tehran, but did not know of a specific assassination plot. Molotov's response minimized their assertions of an assassination plot, instead emphasizing that Stalin thought President Roosevelt would be safer at the Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" />  American and British intelligence reports generally dismissed the existence of this plot and [[Otto Skorzeny]], the alleged leader of the operation, later claimed that Hitler had dismissed the idea as unworkable before planning had even begun.<ref>{{cite book|title=Triple jeopardy: the Nazi plan to kill WWII leaders in Tehran|last=Dolgopolov|first=Nikolai|date=January 2007|publisher=RIA Nowosti vom 4.}}</ref> The topic continues to be a theme of certain Russian historians.<ref>\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446: \u0422\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d-43 : \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \"\u0414\u043b\u0438\u043d. \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043e\u043a\". \u042d\u041a\u0421\u041c\u041e, Moskau 2003, {{ISBN|5-8153-0146-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dolgopolov|first= Nikolai|title= Triple jeopardy: the Nazi plan to kill WWII leaders in Tehran|publisher= RIA Nowosti vom 4.| date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[List of Allied World War II conferences]]\n* [[List of Soviet Union\u2013United States summits]]\n* ''[[Teheran 43]]''\n* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]''\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Best, Geoffrey.

It was held in the [[Soviet Union]]'s embassy in [[Tehran]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]]. It was the first of the [[List of World War II conferences|World War II conferences]] of the \"Big Three\" [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders (the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]). It closely followed the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] which had taken place on 22\u201326 November 1943, and preceded the 1945 [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] conferences. Although the three leaders arrived with differing objectives, the main outcome of the Tehran Conference was the Western Allies' commitment to open a [[Western Front (World War II)|second front]] against [[Nazi Germany]]. The conference also addressed the 'Big Three' Allies' relations with [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], operations in [[Yugoslavia]] and against [[Japan]], and the envisaged post-war settlement. A separate protocol signed at the conference pledged the Big Three to recognize Iran's independence.\n\n==Prelude==\nAs soon as the [[Operation Barbarossa|German-Soviet war]] broke out in June 1941, Churchill offered assistance to the Soviets, and an agreement to this effect was signed on 12 July 1941.<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\">{{cite book| last = Service| first = Robert| date = 2005| title = Stalin: A Biography| publisher = Harvard University Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-674-01697-2| pages = [https://archive.org/details/stalinbiography00serv_0/page/459 459\u201360]| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/stalinbiography00serv_0/page/459}}</ref> However, Churchill in a spoken radio transmission announcing the alliance with the USSR, reminded listeners that this alliance would not change his stance against communism.<ref> Bushkovitch, Paul.

A [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] committee was created to coordinate British and American operations as well as their support to the Soviet Union. The consequences of a global war, the absence of a unified Allied strategy and the complexity of allocating resources between Europe and Asia had not yet been sorted out, and soon gave rise to mutual suspicions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\" /> There was the question of opening a second front to alleviate the German pressure on the Soviet [[Red Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the question of mutual assistance (where both Britain and the Soviet Union were looking towards the United States for credit and material support and there was tension between the United States and Britain since Washington had no desire to prop up the [[British Empire]] in the event of an Allied victory).<ref name=\"Service pp459\u2013460\" /> Also, neither the United States nor Britain were prepared to give Stalin a free hand in [[Eastern Europe]] and, lastly, there was no common policy on how to deal with Germany after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

Stalin arrived well before, followed by Roosevelt, brought in his wheelchair from his accommodation adjacent to the venue. Roosevelt, who had traveled {{convert|7000|mi|km|-3}} to attend and whose health was already deteriorating, was met by Stalin. This was the first time that they had met.

Up to this point Churchill had advocated the expansion of joint operations of British, American, and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] forces in the Mediterranean, as opening a new western front had been physically impossible due to a lack of existing shipping routes, leaving the Mediterranean and Italy as viable goals for 1943. It was agreed Operation Overlord would be launched by American and British forces by May 1944 and that Stalin would support the Allies with a concurrent major offensive on Germany's eastern front ([[Operation Bagration]]) to divert German forces from northern France.<ref name=USDOS>{{cite web|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/tehran-conf|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdditional offensives were also discussed to compliment the undertaking of Operation Overlord, including the possible allied invasion of southern France prior to the landings at Normandy with the goal of drawing German forces away from the northern beaches and even a possible strike at the northern tip of the Adriatic to circumvent the Alps and drive towards Vienna. Either plan would have relied on Allied divisions engaged against the German army in Italy at the time of the conference.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Churchill, Winston S.|title=Closing the Ring : the Second World War, Volume 5.|date=2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1142-0|oclc=988869581}}</ref>\n\n[[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and [[Turkey]] were discussed in detail. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin all agreed to support Iran's government, as addressed in the following declaration:\n\n{{quote |The Three Governments realize that the war has caused special economic difficulties for Iran, and they all agreed that they will continue to make available to the Government of Iran such economic assistance as may be possible, having regard to the heavy demands made upon them by their world-wide military operations, and to the world-wide shortage of transport, raw materials, and supplies for civilian consumption.<ref>Declaration of the Three Powers Regarding Iran \u2013 1 December 1943</ref>}}\n\nIn addition, the Soviet Union was required to pledge support to Turkey if that country entered the war. Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed that it would also be most desirable if Turkey entered on the Allies' side before the year was out.\n\nDespite accepting the above arrangements, Stalin dominated the conference. He used the prestige of the Soviet victory at the [[Battle of Kursk]] to get his way. Roosevelt attempted to cope with Stalin's onslaught of demands, but was able to do little except appease Stalin. Churchill argued for the invasion of Italy in 1943, then Overlord in 1944, on the basis that Overlord was physically impossible in 1943 due to lack of shipping and it would be unthinkable to do anything major until it could be launched.<ref>McNeill, ''American, Britain and Russia'' (1953). p. 353.</ref>\n\nChurchill proposed to Stalin a moving westwards of Poland, which Stalin accepted, which gave the Poles industrialized German land to the west and gave up marshlands to the east, while providing a territorial buffer to the Soviet Union against invasion. Churchill's plan involved a border along the Oder and the [[Eastern Neisse]], giving Poland a fair compensation for the [[Eastern Borderlands]] in Churchill's view. <ref> {{cite book|title=\"Westverschiebung\" und \"Umsiedlung\" - Kriegsziele der Alliierten oder Postulat polnischer Politik?|author= Michael A. Hartenstein|lang=de}} </ref>\n\n===Dinner meeting===\nBefore the Tripartite Dinner Meeting of 29 November 1943 at the Conference, Churchill presented Stalin with a specially commissioned ceremonial sword (the \"[[Sword of Stalingrad]]\", made in [[Sheffield]]), as a gift from King [[George VI]] to the citizens of Stalingrad and the Soviet people, commemorating [[Battle of Stalingrad|the Soviet victory at Stalingrad]]. When Stalin received the sheathed sword, he took it with both hands and kissed the scabbard.

Roosevelt, believing Stalin was not serious, joked that \"maybe 49,000 would be enough\". Churchill, however, was outraged and denounced \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country\". He said that only war criminals should be put on trial in accordance with the [[Moscow Declaration#Declaration on Atrocities|Moscow Document]], which he himself had written. He stormed out of the room, but was brought back in by Stalin who said he was joking.

Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt addressed the issue of Iran's special financial needs during the war, and the possibility of needing aid after the war. The three powers declared to continue to render aid to Iran. The Government of Iran and the three powers reach an accord within all the disagreements to maintain the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Iran. The United States, USSR, and the United Kingdom expect Iran to follow along with the other allied nations to establish peace once the war is over, this is what was agreed upon once the declaration was made.\n\n'''Conclusions:'''\n\n# The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] also known as [[National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia]] should be supported by supplies and equipment to the maximum extent and also by [[commando]] operations.\n# The leaders exclaimed that it would be desirable if Turkey should come into war on the side of the Allies before the end of the year.\n# The leaders took note of Stalin's statement that if Turkey found herself at war with Germany, and as a result Bulgaria declared war on Turkey or attacked her, the Soviet Union would immediately be at war with Bulgaria. The Conference further took note that this could be mentioned in the forthcoming negotiations to bring Turkey into the war.\n#The cross-channel invasion of France ([[Operation Overlord]]) would be launched during May 1944, in conjunction with an operation against southern France ([[Operation Dragoon]]). The latter operation would be undertaken in as great a strength as the availability of landing-craft permitted. The Conference further took note of Joseph Stalin's statement that the Soviet forces would launch an offensive ([[Operation Bagration]]) at about the same time with the object of preventing the German forces from transferring from the Eastern to the Western Front. Overlord was to be on 1 June, but because of the moon and tides required it slipped to 5 June.<ref> *{{cite book |last= Caddick-Adams  |first=  Peter |title= Sand & Steel: A New History of D-Day |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2019 |publisher= Hutchinson |location= London |isbn= 978-1-84794-8-281 |oclc= |page= 339 }} </ref> \n# The leaders agreed that the military staffs of the Three Powers should keep in close touch with each other in regard to the impending operations in Europe. In particular it was agreed that a cover plan to mislead the enemy about these operations should be concerted between the staffs concerned.\n\n'''Political decisions:'''\n\nStalin and Churchill discussed the future borders of Poland and settled on the Curzon line in the east and the Oder-Eastern Neisse line in the west. FDR had asked to be excused from any discussion of Poland out of consideration for the effects of any decision on Polish voters in the USA and the upcoming 1944 election. This decision was not ratified until the [[Potsdam Conference]] of 1945.\n\nDuring the negotiations at the Tehran Conference, Roosevelt secured the reincorporation of the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet Union only after the citizens voted on these actions. Stalin would not consent to any international control over the elections, and that all issues would have to be resolved in accordance with the Soviet Constitution.\n\n==Results==\nThe Yugoslav Partisans were given full Allied support, and Allied support to the Yugoslav [[Chetniks]] was halted (they were believed to be cooperating with the occupying Germans rather than fighting them); see [[Yugoslavia and the Allies]].  \n\nThe Communist Partisans under [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] took power in Yugoslavia as the Germans gradually retreated from the Balkans in 1944\u201345.<ref>McNeill, ''America, Britain, and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941\u20131946'' (1953) 388\u201390</ref>\n\nTurkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in November 1943, and promised to enter the war when his country was fully armed. By August 1944 Turkey broke off relations with Germany. In February 1945, Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan, which may have been a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations.<ref>Erik J.

This decision may be the most critical to come out of this conference, as the desired effect of the relief of Soviet troops was achieved, leading to a Soviet rally and advance toward Germany, a tide Hitler could not stem.\n\n=== United Nations ===\n\nThe Tehran Conference also served as one of the first conversations surrounding the formation of the [[United Nations]]. President Roosevelt first introduced Stalin to the idea of an international organization comprising all nation states, a venue for the resolution of common issues, and a check against international aggressors. With Germany having thrust the world into chaos for the second time in as many generations, the three world leaders all agreed that something must be done to prevent a similar occurrence.<ref name=\":2\">Roberts, Geoffrey (Fall 2007). \"Stalin at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences\".

On 2 February, Stalin told the American ambassador that America could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan (Vladivostok is in the Russian Far East, not Siberia).<ref> {{cite book |last= Ehrman |first= John |title= Grand Strategy Volume V, August 1943-September 1944 |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1956 |publisher= HMSO (British official history) |location= London |isbn= |oclc= |pages= 429,430}} </ref>\n\n==Alleged assassination plot==\n{{main|Operation Long Jump}}\nAccording to Soviet reports, German agents planned to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference, but called off the [[assassination]] while it was still in the planning stage. The [[NKVD]], the USSR's counterintelligence unit, first notified Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of security, of the suspected assassination plot several days prior to Roosevelt's  arrival in Tehran. Reilly had gone to Tehran several days early to evaluate security concerns and explore potential routes from Cairo to Tehran. Just before Reilly returned to Cairo, the [[NKVD]] informed him that dozens of Germans had been dropped into Tehran by parachute the day before. The [[NKVD]] suspected German agents were planning to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Summit at Tehran|last=Eubank|first=Keith|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York|pages=170\u2013173}}</ref>\n\nWhen housing accommodations for the meeting were originally discussed, both Stalin and Churchill had extended invitations to Roosevelt, asking him to stay with them during the meeting. However, Roosevelt wanted to avoid the appearance of choosing one ally over another and decided it was important to stay at the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|American legation]] to remain independent.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Eureka Summit: Agreement in Principle and the Big Three at Tehran, 1943|last=Mayle|first=Paul|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1987|isbn=|location=London and Toronto|pages=57\u201359}}</ref> Roosevelt arrived in Tehran on 27 November 1943 and settled into the American legation. Close to midnight, [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Vyacheslov Molotov]], Stalin's top aide, summoned [[Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel|Archibald Clark-Kerr]] (the British Ambassador in the Soviet Union) and [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]] (the American Ambassador in the Soviet Union) to the Soviet embassy, warning them of an assassination plot against Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Molotov informed them several assassins had been apprehended, but reported additional assassins were at large and expressed concerns for President Roosevelt's safety. Molotov advised Roosevelt should be moved to the safety of the British or Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmericans suspected Stalin had fabricated the assassination plot as an excuse to have Roosevelt moved to the Soviet embassy. Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of Secret Service, advised him to move to either the Soviet or British embassies for his safety. One of the underlying factors influencing their decision was the distance Churchill and Stalin would need to travel for meetings at the American legation. Harriman reminded the President that the Americans would be held responsible if Stalin or Churchill were assassinated while traveling to visit Roosevelt all the way across the city.<ref name=\":0\" /> Earlier that day, Molotov had agreed to hold all meetings at the American legation because traveling was difficult for Roosevelt. The timing of Molotov announcing an assassination plot later that night aroused suspicion that his motives were to keep Stalin safely within the guarded walls of the Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Harriman doubted the existence of an assassination plot, but urged the President to relocate to avoid the perception of putting Churchill and Stalin in danger. Roosevelt did not believe there was a credible threat of assassination, but agreed to the move so he could be closer to Stalin and Churchill.<ref name=\":0\" /> Living in the Soviet embassy also allowed Roosevelt to gain more direct access to Stalin and build his trust. Stalin liked having Roosevelt in the embassy because it eliminated the need to travel outside the compound and it allowed him to spy on Roosevelt more easily. The Soviet embassy was guarded by thousands of secret police and located adjacent to the British embassy, which allowed the Big Three to meet securely.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the Tehran Conference ended, Harriman asked Molotov whether there was really ever an assassination threat in Tehran. Molotov said that they knew about German agents in Tehran, but did not know of a specific assassination plot. Molotov's response minimized their assertions of an assassination plot, instead emphasizing that Stalin thought President Roosevelt would be safer at the Soviet embassy.<ref name=\":0\" />  American and British intelligence reports generally dismissed the existence of this plot and [[Otto Skorzeny]], the alleged leader of the operation, later claimed that Hitler had dismissed the idea as unworkable before planning had even begun.<ref>{{cite book|title=Triple jeopardy: the Nazi plan to kill WWII leaders in Tehran|last=Dolgopolov|first=Nikolai|date=January 2007|publisher=RIA Nowosti vom 4.}}</ref> The topic continues to be a theme of certain Russian historians.<ref>\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446: \u0422\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d-43 : \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \"\u0414\u043b\u0438\u043d. \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043e\u043a\". \u042d\u041a\u0421\u041c\u041e, Moskau 2003, {{ISBN|5-8153-0146-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dolgopolov|first= Nikolai|title= Triple jeopardy: the Nazi plan to kill WWII leaders in Tehran|publisher= RIA Nowosti vom 4.| date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[List of Allied World War II conferences]]\n* [[List of Soviet Union\u2013United States summits]]\n* ''[[Teheran 43]]''\n* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]''\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Best, Geoffrey.

Six years later they sold it to wealthy Dutch-American merchant [[Adolphus Philipse]], who obtained a Royal sanction for a \"Highland Patent\" (later to be known as the [[Philipse Patent]]) that encompassed most of today's Putnam County.<ref name=\"disc1\"/><ref name=\"history\"/>  Unknown at that time was a northwest veer in the river's path to the northwest at the [[Hudson Highlands]]. This generated a dispute over a roughly 2-mile-wide section of border between northern [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and then-Dutchess counties and the Connecticut Colony; it came to be known as  \"[[The Oblong]]\".<ref name=Puthist>http://www.putnamcountyny.com/countyhistorian/putnams-past A BRIEF HISTORY OF PUTNAM COUNTY</ref><ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\">[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyputnam/history/chapVIII/index.htm NYGenWeb Putnam County, NY - History, Chap VIII, \"The Oblong\"]. Rootsweb.ancestry.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.</ref>\n\nIn 1737, the New York Colonial Assembly designated the Philipse Patent as the South Precinct of Dutchess County. The Philipses began leasing farms to migrants from [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Long Island]], and lower Westchester. After Adolph Philipse's death, the Patent was divided in 1754 into nine lots granted to three heirs: Mary Philipse, Philip Philipse, and Susannah Philipse Robinson. During the [[French and Indian War]], many of the Wappinger went to [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"disc1\"/><ref name=\"history\" />\n\nCompared to other parts of the [[Hudson Valley]], Putnam County had slow settlement. It was privately owned and settlement was limited to tenant farmers willing to pay  the Philipse family for leases. Secondly, it was mostly hilly and rocky, making it unappealing to men looking for tillable cropland. Its use was generally limited to dairy farming and wood cutting. The first non-tenant settlers in the county were along its eastern edge. The ambiguous border with Connecticut attracted farmers from New England. They assumed that Philipse did not own the disputed area.\n\n[[File:LowsCTmap.jpeg|thumb|250px|A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows [[The Oblong]]. From ''[[Low's Encyclopaedia]]''.]]Among early settlers were the Hayt family, which built a farm called The Elm in 1720.<ref>[http://www.historicpatterson.org/Exhibits/ExhMiscellaneous.php Patterson Through the Years].

As a consequence, their lands were confiscated by the New York government. It sold the Philipse Patent along with the rest of their holdings. The dispute over The Oblong was resolved in the aftermath of the war, with the heavily settled tract being incorporated as the first of two versions of the Town of Southeast. Also resolved were two \"Gores\", the Beekman Gore and the Rombout Gore, which being geographically similar to the [[Livingston Patent|Livingston]] and [[Beekman Patent|Beekman]] patents they abutted, were ceded by the Philipses to Dutchess County in 1758 and 1771 respectively.<ref>[http://genealogytrails.com/ny/dutchess/history/chapter3.html Historical and Genealogical  Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912]</ref><ref>Pellitreau, ''History of Putnam County'', p. 87</ref>\n\nDue to the increasing population of the Southern Precinct of Dutchess County and the great distance of these communities from the county seat<ref name=Puthist/> in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], Putnam was split from Dutchess in 1812 and organized as an independent county.<ref name=\"disc1\" /><ref name=\"Putnam\">{{cite web|author=GenWeb|title=Putnam County|year=2006|publisher=Rootsweb|accessdate=2008-01-27|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyputnam/}}</ref> It encompassed all of the Philipse Patent and the Oblong abutting it, less a triangular area in the farthest northwest reach of the Patent.  There, a lowland near [[Fishkill Creek]] isolated from the rest of Putnam County and its adjacent upland drainage leading into the Hudson Highlands to the south, were ceded to Dutchess. Putnam travelers mostly used boats and ships along the Hudson River. Boats transporting goods traveled up the Hudson to ports, mainly at [[Peekskill, New York]]. They were transported by road into Putnam County, or goods were unloaded in Putnam County at [[Cold Spring, New York]].<ref name=\"disc1\" /> Such transport suffered in winter, when the river froze. At that time, little food or goods could be shipped to the county.\n\nThe Philipstown Turnpike was created in 1815 as a [[toll road]] from Cold Spring to Connecticut. The wagons that traveled the road would transport produce from eastern Putnam County and [[iron ore]] from the mines. The route of the turnpike can roughly be traced today: Rt 301 from Cold Spring to Farmers Mills Road, to White Pond Road to Pecksville, then Holmes Rd to Patterson, then Quaker Hill Rd to Connecticut.<ref name=\"disc1\" /> Transportation improved with the advent of the railroad, namely the Harlem Line, which was built in the 1840s, connecting Putnam by rail to New York City. Originally there were four stations on the Harlem line in Putnam County: Brewster, Dykemans, Towners, and Patterson. Today only the Brewster and Patterson stops remain; a new one called Southeast was added in modern times.\n\nPutnam County played an important role in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. One third of the county's men between the ages of 15 and 55 served in the military during the war years.<ref name=\"disc1\" /> During the post-Civil War years, industry and agriculture suffered losses as the economy contracted. Iron, which was produced in the Highland Mountains, could be found elsewhere. Agriculture was also affected greatly. The increasing need for drinking water in New York City led the city to search for sources in the Hudson Valley. In Putnam County, much of the farmland was flooded to create reservoirs as part of New York City\u2019s [[Croton Watershed]]. The abandoning of farms, the creation of reservoirs, and the preservation of the remaining open land resulted in scenic lands that drew large amounts of tourism from New York City.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\nBy the 20th century, improved roads brought vacationers from New York City. The [[Taconic State Parkway]] was constructed during the [[Great Depression]] as one of numerous infrastructure projects in the state and country. This brought more vacationers from the city, who were attracted to the scenic lands and the inexpensive hotels, inns, and summer houses. Putnam County's population doubled during the summer months.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\nAfter World War II, Putnam County became an [[exurb]] of New York City. Rapid suburban development occurred and the county became a [[bedroom community]]. However, the prevalent rocky uplands and protection of Putnam county's reservoirs inherently limited development, as much of the land in the county is close to wetlands or reservoirs.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\n==Government and politics==\n[[File:New Putnam County Courthouse April 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|The new Putnam County Courthouse in Carmel]]\n[[File:PC Courthouse 800.jpg|thumb|250px|The Historic Putnam County Courthouse (1814) in Carmel]]\nGovernmental operations in Putnam County are outlined in the County Charter, which was approved by the voters of the County in November 1977. It is administered by a [[County Executive]], elected [[at-large]], and a 9-member County Legislature, elected from [[single-member districts]].\n\nThe current County Executive is MaryEllen Odell. She won a special election for the office in November 2011, following her defeat in 2010 for such office by then-state Senator [[Vincent Leibell]].  In 2010 Leibell pleaded guilty to two federal felony charges in 2010.  Following a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Leibell resigned his state Senate seat and did not assume the office of County Executive on January 1, 2011.<ref name=\"disc5\" />\n\nPrior to the Charter form of government, the County's affairs were managed by Board of Supervisors, with one Supervisor from each of the County\u2019s six towns. As these had populations of differing size, these geographic districts violated the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]].\"\n\n===County Executives===\nThe County has had five County Executives:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The County Board of Supervisors was dissolved on the previous day and members of the County Legislature for the year 1979 were the supervisors of each of the six towns.  Ethel Forkell was Supervisor of the Town of Kent and was elected by her colleagues as the first Chair of the County Legislature.\n\n===County Courts===\nThere are three types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the [[New York Supreme Court]], the County Court and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system as well as in most states, whereas the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. The [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has [[jurisdiction]] over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.<ref name=\"disc7\">{{cite web|author=New York State united court system|title=Courts in Putnam county|year=2007|publisher=New York State united court system|accessdate=2008-01-13|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/9jd/Putnam/supremecounty.shtml}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Supreme Court|County Court]] is authorized to hear all criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.<ref name=\"disc7\" />\n\nThe Historic Putnam County Courthouse is located in the town of Carmel.<ref name=\"disc7\" /> Built in 1814 in Greek Revival style, it is the second oldest working courthouse in New York, second to the one in [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown]]. Portico and pillars were added to the structure in the 1840s. It was recently extensively remodeled to preserve the structure and adapt it for use as the Surrogate's Court.<ref>[http://www.visitputnam.org/historic/carmel.html Putnam County Visitors' Bureau]</ref>\n\nThe New Putnam County Courthouse opened on January 2, 2008. It was constructed at a cost of $22.8 million. Jury assembly, court clerks and a public law library are located on the first floor. The second floor includes a Family Court and hearing room. On all floors are judges' chambers, jury deliberation rooms, prisoner cells and conference rooms. The third floor has two courtrooms for the County Court. The Supreme Court and a law library occupy the fourth floor.<ref>[http://lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071229/NEWS04/712290359 \"Putnam's $22.8M courthouse to open Wednesday,\" by Susan Elan, ''The Journal News'', December 29, 2007 ]</ref>\n\n===Law enforcement===\nThe towns of Carmel and Kent, as well as the villages of Brewster and Cold Spring, have their own police departments. Primary law enforcement services for the rest of Putnam County are provided by the [[New York State Police]] and the Putnam County Sheriff's Department.\n\n===County Sheriff===\nThe current Sheriff, Robert L.

Both have been owned since 1958 by Don Hall. Hall and Roger Ailes, though both Republicans, are bitter rivals. Hall had long derided Ailes as a part-time resident. When Ailes faced harassment allegations, leading to his ouster from ''Fox News'', his Putnam County connection contributed to his being featured on the front pages of the ''Times'' and ''Press''.\n\nIn 2010, Gordon Stewart, a businessman living in Garrison, launched a news website to compete with the Ailes-owned ''PCNR'' called Philipstown.info. In 2012 a print version was launched called ''The Paper''. Shortly Stewart's death in 2014, the publication became a nonprofit led by a board of directors. It changed its name in 2016 to ''The Highlands Current'' to reflect its coverage of neighboring Beacon.\n\n==Communities==\n\nThere are six towns and three incorporated villages in Putnam County.

The Philipses began leasing farms to migrants from [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Long Island]], and lower Westchester. After Adolph Philipse's death, the Patent was divided in 1754 into nine lots granted to three heirs: Mary Philipse, Philip Philipse, and Susannah Philipse Robinson. During the [[French and Indian War]], many of the Wappinger went to [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"disc1\"/><ref name=\"history\" />\n\nCompared to other parts of the [[Hudson Valley]], Putnam County had slow settlement. It was privately owned and settlement was limited to tenant farmers willing to pay  the Philipse family for leases. Secondly, it was mostly hilly and rocky, making it unappealing to men looking for tillable cropland. Its use was generally limited to dairy farming and wood cutting. The first non-tenant settlers in the county were along its eastern edge. The ambiguous border with Connecticut attracted farmers from New England. They assumed that Philipse did not own the disputed area.\n\n[[File:LowsCTmap.jpeg|thumb|250px|A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows [[The Oblong]].

As a consequence, their lands were confiscated by the New York government. It sold the Philipse Patent along with the rest of their holdings. The dispute over The Oblong was resolved in the aftermath of the war, with the heavily settled tract being incorporated as the first of two versions of the Town of Southeast. Also resolved were two \"Gores\", the Beekman Gore and the Rombout Gore, which being geographically similar to the [[Livingston Patent|Livingston]] and [[Beekman Patent|Beekman]] patents they abutted, were ceded by the Philipses to Dutchess County in 1758 and 1771 respectively.<ref>[http://genealogytrails.com/ny/dutchess/history/chapter3.html Historical and Genealogical  Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A.

Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912]</ref><ref>Pellitreau, ''History of Putnam County'', p. 87</ref>\n\nDue to the increasing population of the Southern Precinct of Dutchess County and the great distance of these communities from the county seat<ref name=Puthist/> in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], Putnam was split from Dutchess in 1812 and organized as an independent county.<ref name=\"disc1\" /><ref name=\"Putnam\">{{cite web|author=GenWeb|title=Putnam County|year=2006|publisher=Rootsweb|accessdate=2008-01-27|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyputnam/}}</ref> It encompassed all of the Philipse Patent and the Oblong abutting it, less a triangular area in the farthest northwest reach of the Patent.  There, a lowland near [[Fishkill Creek]] isolated from the rest of Putnam County and its adjacent upland drainage leading into the Hudson Highlands to the south, were ceded to Dutchess. Putnam travelers mostly used boats and ships along the Hudson River. Boats transporting goods traveled up the Hudson to ports, mainly at [[Peekskill, New York]]. They were transported by road into Putnam County, or goods were unloaded in Putnam County at [[Cold Spring, New York]].<ref name=\"disc1\" /> Such transport suffered in winter, when the river froze. At that time, little food or goods could be shipped to the county.\n\nThe Philipstown Turnpike was created in 1815 as a [[toll road]] from Cold Spring to Connecticut. The wagons that traveled the road would transport produce from eastern Putnam County and [[iron ore]] from the mines. The route of the turnpike can roughly be traced today: Rt 301 from Cold Spring to Farmers Mills Road, to White Pond Road to Pecksville, then Holmes Rd to Patterson, then Quaker Hill Rd to Connecticut.<ref name=\"disc1\" /> Transportation improved with the advent of the railroad, namely the Harlem Line, which was built in the 1840s, connecting Putnam by rail to New York City. Originally there were four stations on the Harlem line in Putnam County: Brewster, Dykemans, Towners, and Patterson. Today only the Brewster and Patterson stops remain; a new one called Southeast was added in modern times.\n\nPutnam County played an important role in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. One third of the county's men between the ages of 15 and 55 served in the military during the war years.<ref name=\"disc1\" /> During the post-Civil War years, industry and agriculture suffered losses as the economy contracted. Iron, which was produced in the Highland Mountains, could be found elsewhere. Agriculture was also affected greatly. The increasing need for drinking water in New York City led the city to search for sources in the Hudson Valley. In Putnam County, much of the farmland was flooded to create reservoirs as part of New York City\u2019s [[Croton Watershed]]. The abandoning of farms, the creation of reservoirs, and the preservation of the remaining open land resulted in scenic lands that drew large amounts of tourism from New York City.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\nBy the 20th century, improved roads brought vacationers from New York City. The [[Taconic State Parkway]] was constructed during the [[Great Depression]] as one of numerous infrastructure projects in the state and country. This brought more vacationers from the city, who were attracted to the scenic lands and the inexpensive hotels, inns, and summer houses. Putnam County's population doubled during the summer months.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\nAfter World War II, Putnam County became an [[exurb]] of New York City. Rapid suburban development occurred and the county became a [[bedroom community]]. However, the prevalent rocky uplands and protection of Putnam county's reservoirs inherently limited development, as much of the land in the county is close to wetlands or reservoirs.<ref name=\"disc1\" />\n\n==Government and politics==\n[[File:New Putnam County Courthouse April 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|The new Putnam County Courthouse in Carmel]] \n[[File:PC Courthouse 800.jpg|thumb|250px|The Historic Putnam County Courthouse (1814) in Carmel]]\nGovernmental operations in Putnam County are outlined in the County Charter, which was approved by the voters of the County in November 1977. It is administered by a [[County Executive]], elected [[at-large]], and a 9-member County Legislature, elected from [[single-member districts]].\n\nThe current County Executive is MaryEllen Odell. She won a special election for the office in November 2011, following her defeat in 2010 for such office by then-state Senator [[Vincent Leibell]].  In 2010 Leibell pleaded guilty to two federal felony charges in 2010.  Following a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Leibell resigned his state Senate seat and did not assume the office of County Executive on January 1, 2011.<ref name=\"disc5\" />\n\nPrior to the Charter form of government, the County's affairs were managed by Board of Supervisors, with one Supervisor from each of the County\u2019s six towns. As these had populations of differing size, these geographic districts violated the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]].\"\n\n===County Executives===\nThe County has had five County Executives:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The County Board of Supervisors was dissolved on the previous day and members of the County Legislature for the year 1979 were the supervisors of each of the six towns.  Ethel Forkell was Supervisor of the Town of Kent and was elected by her colleagues as the first Chair of the County Legislature.\n\n===County Courts===\nThere are three types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the [[New York Supreme Court]], the County Court and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system as well as in most states, whereas the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. The [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has [[jurisdiction]] over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.<ref name=\"disc7\">{{cite web|author=New York State united court system|title=Courts in Putnam county|year=2007|publisher=New York State united court system|accessdate=2008-01-13|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/9jd/Putnam/supremecounty.shtml}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Supreme Court|County Court]] is authorized to hear all criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.<ref name=\"disc7\" />\n\nThe Historic Putnam County Courthouse is located in the town of Carmel.<ref name=\"disc7\" /> Built in 1814 in Greek Revival style, it is the second oldest working courthouse in New York, second to the one in [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown]]. Portico and pillars were added to the structure in the 1840s. It was recently extensively remodeled to preserve the structure and adapt it for use as the Surrogate's Court.<ref>[http://www.visitputnam.org/historic/carmel.html Putnam County Visitors' Bureau]</ref>\n\nThe New Putnam County Courthouse opened on January 2, 2008. It was constructed at a cost of $22.8 million. Jury assembly, court clerks and a public law library are located on the first floor. The second floor includes a Family Court and hearing room. On all floors are judges' chambers, jury deliberation rooms, prisoner cells and conference rooms. The third floor has two courtrooms for the County Court. The Supreme Court and a law library occupy the fourth floor.<ref>[http://lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071229/NEWS04/712290359 \"Putnam's $22.8M courthouse to open Wednesday,\" by Susan Elan, ''The Journal News'', December 29, 2007 ]</ref>\n\n===Law enforcement===\nThe towns of Carmel and Kent, as well as the villages of Brewster and Cold Spring, have their own police departments.

Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan is roughly a one-hour train ride.\n\nUntil May 1958, a third commuter line, the [[New York Central]]\u2019s [[New York and Putnam Railroad|Putnam Division]], operating between the Bronx and points in the county, served the region. With no direct connection to Grand Central Terminal (a transfer was required in the Bronx), ridership on the line was weak compared to its counterparts. Freight service was also scant. The line was eventually abandoned in waves between 1962 and 1980. The former railbed has been converted to trails, and now serves as the [[South County Trailway]], [[North County Trailway]], and [[Putnam County Trailway]] [[rail trails]].\n\n[[Putnam Transit]], operated by the county, provides local public transportation.\n\nIn contrast to the surrounding counties, Putnam has no [[airport]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Points of interest===\n[[Chuang yen monastery|Chuang Yen Monastery]], located in Kent, is home to the largest indoor Buddha statue in the Western Hemisphere.

''The Journal News'' is owned by [[Gannett|Gannett Company, Inc.]] Before Gannett merged its local dailies into the ''Journal News'', Putnam County was served by an edition of the ''Reporter Dispatch''.\n\nPutnam County newsreaders were served for generations by the ''Putnam County News and Recorder'', formerly an independently owned newspaper devoted to local affairs. The oversized broadsheet \u2013 measuring seventeen by twenty inches \u2013 was first published in Cold Spring as ''The Recorder'' in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Putnam County News & Recorder, Our History|url=http://www.pcnr.com/common/Misc/The_Putnam_County_News__Recorder_Our_History.html|accessdate=12 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218212126/http://www.pcnr.com/common/Misc/The_Putnam_County_News__Recorder_Our_History.html|archive-date=18 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 2008, the local ownership sold the paper to [[Roger Ailes]], chairman of [[Fox News]], who named his wife Elizabeth as the new publisher.

''The Courier'' was first established as the ''Putnam County Democrat'' in 1841. Under Ailes ownership, the ''Courier'' closed its Carmel office. In 2013 the paper was reduced from [[broadsheet]] to [[Berliner (format)]]. The ''News and Recorder'' remained a full broadsheet, with a 17-inch-wide front page,until 2017. The two newspapers share an editor and many of the same stories appear in both. Douglas Cunningham, editor-in-chief of the ''Courier'' and ''News & Recorder'' since 2011, purchased the two papers from the Ailes in December 2016 and became publisher.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reiner|first1=Dan|title=Ailes family sells Putnam newspapers|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/putnam/2016/12/13/ailes-sells-putnam-papers/95397948/|website=lohud|publisher=www.lohud.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2016-12-15/Front_Page/Courier_PCNR_Under_New_Ownership.html|title=Courier, PCNR Under New Ownership|website=The Putnam County Courier|publisher=The Putnam County Courier, LLC|accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220140120/http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2016-12-15/Front_Page/Courier_PCNR_Under_New_Ownership.html|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTwo other weeklies are the ''Putnam County Times'' (historically ''Times & Republican'') and ''Putnam County Press'', virtually identical except that the former is distributed free. Both have been owned since 1958 by Don Hall. Hall and Roger Ailes, though both Republicans, are bitter rivals. Hall had long derided Ailes as a part-time resident. When Ailes faced harassment allegations, leading to his ouster from ''Fox News'', his Putnam County connection contributed to his being featured on the front pages of the ''Times'' and ''Press''.\n\nIn 2010, Gordon Stewart, a businessman living in Garrison, launched a news website to compete with the Ailes-owned ''PCNR'' called Philipstown.info. In 2012 a print version was launched called ''The Paper''. Shortly Stewart's death in 2014, the publication became a nonprofit led by a board of directors. It changed its name in 2016 to ''The Highlands Current'' to reflect its coverage of neighboring Beacon.\n\n==Communities==\n\nThere are six towns and three incorporated villages in Putnam County.
