He was appointed to the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]] in 1986.\n\nAs one of the few early academics-turned-judges, Goff long advocated a complementary view of the role of the legal academic and judge.

[[Lord Denning]] reflected positively on it, calling it \"a creative work\" and comparing it to [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock's]] treatise on torts and the seminal textbook ''Anson's Law of Contract''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denning|first=Tom|date=1966|title=Goff and Jones's The Law of Restitution|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=83|pages=277|via=}}</ref> [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Edmund Davies]], then a judge of the [[High Court of Justice]], described it as \"admirable\". The book's propositions, however, caused some confusion in academic circles. Not knowing where it fit, a university library classified it as Criminal Law, and a library of one of the Inns of Court refused to take the book in at all.<ref name=\":822\" /> The book's propositions were also not unanimously welcomed. For example, they were resisted by [[Lord Diplock]], who as late as in 1977 continued to declare judicially that \"there is no general doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law\".<ref>''Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd'' [1977] 3 All ER 1, \"My Lords, there is no general doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law. What it does is to provide specific remedies in particular cases of what might be classified as unjust enrichment in a legal system that is based upon the civil law. There are some circumstances in which the remedy takes the form of 'subrogation', but this expression embraces more than a single concept in English law.\"</ref>\n\nGoff submitted the textbook to the University of Oxford for the consideration of a higher degree, and he was awarded a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] in 1971.<ref name=\":822\" /> He would later also receive honorary degrees from the universities of [[University of London|London]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Reading|Reading]], [[University of Buckingham|Buckingham]] and [[City, University of London]].<ref name=\":822\" /> In 1975, Goff was appointed to the High Court.<ref name=\":822\" /> Goff and Jones jointly wrote two further editions of the textbook, which were published in 1978 and 1986, respectively.<ref name=\":822\" /> In the latter year, Goff was appointed to the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].<ref name=\":822\" /> He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1987, and would go on to hold Honorary Fellowships at three Oxford University colleges: New, Lincoln, and [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]].<ref name=\":83\" />\n\n=== Career at the Bar ===\nGoff left academia to join the Commercial Bar in 1955, at a time when the prevailing belief was that there was a sharp difference between the academic lawyer and the practicing lawyer.<ref name=\":822\" /> He joined the chambers of Ashton Roskill [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], then known as 5, King's Bench Walk (but which later amalgamated with 6, King's Bench Walk to form what is today known as 7, King's Bench Walk, or 7KBW).<ref name=\":822\" /> He described his time as a junior barrister as \"lean\", because at that time, there was very little small work for junior barristers at the commercial Bar.<ref name=\":822\" /> The bulk of cases went to senior barristers, who tended to have almost permanent junior barristers assisting them.<ref name=\":822\" /> Goff was led by Roskill twice when his usual junior had pneumonia, but was hardly led by anyone else.<ref name=\":822\" /> He took this as an opportunity to teach at Inner Temple and (on weekends) at Lincoln College, and to continue writing his book on the law of restitution.<ref name=\":822\" />\n\nGoff believed the publication of ''Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution'' in 1966 to be one of the reasons he was appointed Queen's Counsel.<ref name=\":822\" /> He [[Take silk|took silk]] in 1967, a year after it was published.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Goff|first=Robert|url=|title=Address
