In Solo ([[Surakarta]]), Kleen worked with [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]] to write an anthropological study on the ritual court dances of Solo. Both also participated in the dance lessons.[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers] Kleen felt that dancing not only involved making the right movements on the sound of music, but that it also involved the transition into an altered state of mind to become in harmony not only with oneself, but with the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, this project ended in July 1920 in turmoil due to clashing personalities, and van Helsdingen-Schoevers died 17 August 1920 of an unknown disease.<ref>Vivian van de Loo, \"Leven tussen Kunst en Krant, [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]],[[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers]] journaliste en declamatrice in Indi\u00eb.

In July 1925 there appeared a new edition with 30 pages of text. The coloured plates were reproductions made by the Topographic Service of Kleen's drawings. For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\nWhat was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?\n[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Ge\u00efllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. \nHe ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hindu\u00efstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Ori\u00ebtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\nWhat was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?\n[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Ge\u00efllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. \nHe ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hindu\u00efstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Ori\u00ebtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref>IEC 60027-3:2002</ref>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]].

S. Clay (1999), Underwater sound transmission and SI units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3047</ref>\n\nThe human ear has a large [[dynamic range]] in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10<sup>12</sup>).<ref>{{citation |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |archive-date=9 May 2016 |date=2008}}</ref> Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in [[logarithmic scale]]: the base-10 logarithm of 10<sup>12</sup> is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120&nbsp;dB re 20&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|\u03bcPa]].\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4&nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]], are factored more heavily into some measurements using [[frequency weighting]]. (See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a [[hyphen]], as in \"dB{{nbhyph}}Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB&nbsp;HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600&nbsp;\u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>)&nbsp;\u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1&nbsp;volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|\u221210 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3&nbsp;\u2013 What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]].

(See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a [[hyphen]], as in \"dB{{nbhyph}}Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB&nbsp;HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600&nbsp;\u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>)&nbsp;\u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1&nbsp;volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|\u221210 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3&nbsp;\u2013 What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

In 1992, former [[Liga III|Divizia C]] member ''Petrolul Arad/ Z\u0103d\u0103reni (est. 1983)'' merged with ''Aurul Negru Pecica (est. 1949)'' and formed a new entity, West Petrom Arad (Pecica). West Petrom was financially supported by [[Petrom]] and for 10 years (1994\u20132004) played in the third tier, but with oscillating results.\n\nIn 2001, ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' withdrew from the West Petrom Association, changed its name back to '''Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled a senior squad in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] \u2013 [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]]. Progresul relegated in the [[Liga V|Honor Division]] after only one season, while West Petrom spent three more seasons in the third tier before it was dissolved.

It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army.

For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior.

It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Sch\u00f6rner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Opposing forces===\nGerman forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-a.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-b.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-a.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-b.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)]]\n\n===Drive on Dresden===\nOn 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Wei\u00dfenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of G\u00f6rlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M. K.

The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[K\u00f6nigswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>\n\n===Polish retreat===\nEventually, \u015awierczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while \u015awierczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> \u015awierczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], K\u00f6nigswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Wei\u00dfenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]].

By the time the Battle of Bautzen had begun, both the 21st Panzer Division and the 10th SS Panzer Division (minus its supply train) were committed to support the 9th Army and both were encircled in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The assessments of Polish historian Kormonicki,<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> German general von Ahlfen, and Polish historian Grzelak all support the order of battle not including the 21st and 10th SS Divisions.\n</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ahlfen207208>{{cite book|author=Hans Ahlfen|title=Der Kampf um Schlesien 1944/1945 (The Battle of Silesia 1944/1945)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3IA0TiSGIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2011|year=1977|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|isbn=978-3-87943-480-0|pages=207\u2013208|language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ahlfen208>{{cite book|author=Hans Ahlfen|title=Der Kampf um Schlesien 1944/1945 (The Battle of Silesia 1944/1945)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3IA0TiSGIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2011|year=1977|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|isbn=978-3-87943-480-0|page=208|language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ahlfen208209>{{cite book|author=Hans Ahlfen|title=Der Kampf um Schlesien 1944/1945 (The Battle of Silesia 1944/1945)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3IA0TiSGIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2011|year=1977|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|isbn=978-3-87943-480-0|pages=208\u2013209|language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ahlfen209>{{cite book|author=Hans Ahlfen|title=Der Kampf um Schlesien 1944/1945 (The Battle of Silesia 1944/1945)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3IA0TiSGIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2011|year=1977|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|isbn=978-3-87943-480-0|page=209|language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ba>{{cite web |url=http://www.bautzen-anzeiger.de/bautzen/gesellschaft/6794_gedenken-an-kriegsgraeuel-von-niederkaina.html |title= Gedenken an Kriegsgr\u00e4uel von Niederkaina - Bautzner Anzeiger (Remembrance of the wartime atrocities of Niederkaina)|author=Delnja Kina|language= German|accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bahm2001\">{{cite book|author=Karl Bahm|title=Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3IA0TiSGIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2011|date=26 November 2001|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-1240-7|page=129}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eberhardt\">{{Cite book|title=Kriegsschauplatz Sachsen 1945; Die K\u00e4mpfe um Bautzen 18. bis 27.
