Jessica Jackley worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While Flannery was visiting Jackley in Africa, the two spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, the two began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept. After the success of Kiva's initial stage, Flannery and Jackley founded Kiva as a non-profit. In 2006, notable entrepreneurs and businessmen joined Kiva's staff, including [[Premal Shah]] from PayPal and [[Reid Hoffman]], CEO and founder of [[LinkedIn]]. Shortly after its first anniversary in October 2006, Kiva reached $1 million in facilitated loans and acquired its twentieth field partner.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} To the present day, Kiva has continued to grow and expand its field partners while acquiring support from the media and the public.\n\n== Lending process ==\nKiva works with more than 300 [[microfinance]] institutions, social impact businesses, schools and non-profit organizations around the world, called \"Field Partners,\" that post profiles of qualified local entrepreneurs on the Kiva website. Lenders browse borrower profiles on kiva.org and choose an entrepreneur they wish to fund.

Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing that \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Kiva Zip transfers funds directly to borrowers without outsourcing disbursements and repayment collection to field partners.  Instead, Kiva Zip partners with local institutions called Trustees, who vet loan applicants, provide mentorship, and may post profiles and updates on their behalf.  Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.  Kiva Zip is considered an experimental platform, and offers loans in the United States and in Kenya.  In the future, it hopes to expand to other locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zip.kiva.org/faq# |title=Kiva Zip: FAQ|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>  Kiva Zip's repayment rate is 89.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zip.kiva.org/|title=Kiva Zip: Innovations in Person-to-Person Lending|accessdate=26 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142613/https://zip.kiva.org/|archive-date=April 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Interest rates by field partner====\n\nAs of November 2018, there are a total of 332 field partners listed on the Kiva website and their status is as follows: 173 Active, 41 Inactive, 14 Paused, and 104 Experimental.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Jessica Jackley, worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While visiting Jackley in Africa, Flannery and Jackley spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, they began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept.

Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol, and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including Native American lands.\n\n===The frontier===\n\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Indiana Territory}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 210\n|image1=Indiana Indian treaties.svg\n|alt1=A colorful map of Indiana with treaty names\n|image2=Indiana, 1817.jpg\n|alt2=A crude map of Indiana with only a handful of southern counties delineated\n|caption2=Above: a map showing extent of the treaty lands.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises.

The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].\n\n====Highways====\n\n[[File:I-69 Construction Indiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] extension project in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]]]]\n\nThe major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio\u2013Indiana\u2013Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].\n\n====Ports====\n\n[[File:Towboat Ben McCool upbound on Ohio River with two tank barges (1 of 6) 87j082.jpg|thumb|Barges are a common sight along the [[Ohio River]].

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools.

Its capital and largest city is [[Indianapolis]]. Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816. Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]]. In 1816, when Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the geographic area for the new state.<ref>A portion of the Northwest Territory's eastern section became the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803. The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were [[nomad]]s who hunted large [[Game (food)|game]] such as [[mastodons]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\n\nIn 2016, Indiana was home to seven [[Fortune 500]] companies with a combined $142.5 billion in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana Businesses Shuffle on Fortune 500|first=Dan|last=McGowan|publisher=Inside Indiana Business|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/32221981/indiana-businesses-shuffle-around-on-fortune-500|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Columbus, Indiana|Columbus]]-based [[Cummins, Inc.]] and Indianapolis-based [[Eli Lilly and Company]] and [[Simon Property Group]] were recognized in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' publication's \"2017 World's Most Admired Companies List\", ranking in each of their respective industries.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 Indiana companies make Fortune's 2017 World's Most Admired Companies List|first=Allison|last=Carter|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/02/20/3-indiana-companies-make-fortunes-2017-worlds-most-admired-companies-list/98149374/|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Northwest Indiana]] has been the largest steel producing center in the U.S. since 1975 and accounted for 27 percent of American-made steel in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana leads nation in steel production|first=Joseph|last=Pete|publisher=Northwest Indiana Times|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/business/steel/indiana-leads-nation-in-steel-production/article_def40810-528e-5a98-acc2-ebab79de08a2.html|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wndu.com/news/112005/news_46007.php|title=WNDU-TV: News Story: Bayer is leaving Elkhart \u2013 November 16, 2005}}</ref> Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all U.S. states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Economy & Demographics | publisher=Terre Haute Economic Development Co. | url=http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716101025/http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 16, 2006 | accessdate=January 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIndiana is within the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]].

The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]].

The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools. Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards. In 2017, the Indiana Department of Education reported that the state's overall graduation rates were 87.19% for waivered graduations and 80.10% for non-waiver graduations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Adam |title=Indiana Department of Education Releases 2017 Graduation Rates |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/news/indiana-department-education-releases-2017-graduation-rates |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe largest educational institution is [[Indiana University]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington|flagship campus]] of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820.

With the Beatles' manager, [[Brian Epstein]], he co-owned Brydor Cars, which supplied sportscars to many figures in the [[Swinging London]] era, including members of the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Doran managed the Beatles' company [[Apple Publishing]] in the late 1960s. Following the band's break-up in 1970, he worked as the estate manager at [[George Harrison]]'s [[Friar Park]] property and managed Harrison's London office of [[Dark Horse Records]]. He is often cited as the inspiration behind the line \"Meeting a man from the motor trade\" in the Beatles' 1967 song \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", although [[Paul McCartney]] himself denied the story.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneyman00mile/page/316 |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=1997 |publisher=Henry Holt |isbn=0805052496 |location=New York, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneyman00mile/page/316 316] |oclc=40284619 }}</ref>\n\nDoran suggested the verb '''fill''' in the line \"Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall\", from [[A Day in the Life]], the final track of [[The Beatles]]' 1967 album [[Sgt.

Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] describes Doran as \"a car salesman with a sharp mind and a ready Liverpool wit\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=277}} Doran met the Beatles in the early 1960s, shortly after Epstein had become the band's manager.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=570}} He worked for Hawthorne Motors, a [[car dealership]] in [[Warrington]], and sold the first car owned by a member of the Beatles \u2013 a blue [[Ford Anglia]] \u2013 to [[George Harrison]], the youngest member of the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} In exchange for the reasonable terms offered by Doran, Harrison agreed to pose with his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], and the car, in an advertisement for Hawthorne.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} The ad appeared in the local ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music newspaper in July 1962, at a time when the Beatles' popularity had yet to expand beyond the north of England and the club circuit in Hamburg.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=683}} Doran then supplied the band \u2013 who were soon to fire [[Pete Best]] as their drummer and possibly lose their means of transport to gigs \u2013 with an eight-seater Ford Thames van, which NEMS purchased on the group's behalf.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=684}}\n\nHaving joined Epstein and the Beatles in London, Doran worked as manager of [[Apple Publishing]] in 1967 and later managed the band [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]].

(band)|Grapefruit]]. With the Beatles' manager, [[Brian Epstein]], he co-owned Brydor Cars, which supplied sportscars to many figures in the [[Swinging London]] era, including members of the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Doran managed the Beatles' company [[Apple Publishing]] in the late 1960s. Following the band's break-up in 1970, he worked as the estate manager at [[George Harrison]]'s [[Friar Park]] property and managed Harrison's London office of [[Dark Horse Records]]. He is often cited as the inspiration behind the line \"Meeting a man from the motor trade\" in the Beatles' 1967 song \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", although [[Paul McCartney]] himself denied the story.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneyman00mile/page/316 |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=1997 |publisher=Henry Holt |isbn=0805052496 |location=New York, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneyman00mile/page/316 316] |oclc=40284619 }}</ref>\n\nDoran suggested the verb '''fill''' in the line \"Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall\", from [[A Day in the Life]], the final track of [[The Beatles]]' 1967 album [[Sgt.

Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] describes Doran as \"a car salesman with a sharp mind and a ready Liverpool wit\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=277}} Doran met the Beatles in the early 1960s, shortly after Epstein had become the band's manager.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=570}} He worked for Hawthorne Motors, a [[car dealership]] in [[Warrington]], and sold the first car owned by a member of the Beatles \u2013 a blue [[Ford Anglia]] \u2013 to [[George Harrison]], the youngest member of the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} In exchange for the reasonable terms offered by Doran, Harrison agreed to pose with his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], and the car, in an advertisement for Hawthorne.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} The ad appeared in the local ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music newspaper in July 1962, at a time when the Beatles' popularity had yet to expand beyond the north of England and the club circuit in Hamburg.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=683}} Doran then supplied the band \u2013 who were soon to fire [[Pete Best]] as their drummer and possibly lose their means of transport to gigs \u2013 with an eight-seater Ford Thames van, which NEMS purchased on the group's behalf.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=684}}\n\nHaving joined Epstein and the Beatles in London, Doran worked as manager of [[Apple Publishing]] in 1967 and later managed the band [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]]. He also enjoyed success as the manager of Apple Records artist [[Mary Hopkin]], although Hopkin later said she was highly dissatisfied with his

The screenplay was adapted by [[Bryan Forbes]] from the [[I Was Monty's Double|autobiography]] of [[M. E. Clifton James]], an actor who pretended to be General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] as a decoy during the [[World War II|Second World War]].{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nA few months before the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than [[Normandy]]. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan ([[Cecil Parker]]) and Major Harvey ([[John Mills]]). They are initially unable to devise such a plan \u2013 but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]].\n\nLogan and Harvey discover that the actor is [[M. E. Clifton James]] (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in [[Leicester]] with the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]] and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour [[North Africa]], impersonating \"Monty\".\n\n'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees.\n\nDisguised as a [[corporal]], he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa.\n\nAccompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to [[brigadier]] for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, \"Jimmy\" arrives at [[Gibraltar]], where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson ([[Marius Goring]]), is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar.\n\nJames and Harvey tour several places in North Africa and visit the troops. With only a few days to go before the landings, it is learned that the Germans have indeed been fooled and have kept large numbers of troops in the south, away from Normandy. His job done, James is put into \"cold storage\" at a heavily guarded villa on the coast.\n\nBut the Germans have been fooled more than Harvey realises. A team of German [[commando]]s are landed by [[submarine]] to kidnap 'Monty'. They kill his guards and are ready to embark with James, but Harvey gets wind of the kidnap and foils it at the last moment. They return quietly to London.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[M. E. Clifton James]] as himself and General Montgomery\n*[[John Mills]] as Major Harvey\n*[[Cecil Parker]] as Colonel E. F.

The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place.\n\nGibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what \"Monty\" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non-existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously.\n\nThe intelligence officer who initially recruited James was [[David Niven]], at that time serving as a lieutenant-colonel at the War Office.\n\n==Production==\nBased on Lieut. M.E. Clifton James' own story of his successful attempt to deceive the Germans regarding General Montgomery's pre-D. Day movements, ''I Was Monty's Double'' also includes well-received performances by [[Leslie Phillips]], [[Michael Hordern]] as the governor of Gibraltar, \"Rusty\" Eastwood, [[Marius Goring]] as Karl Nielson and [[Barbara Hicks]] as Logan's formidably competent secretary, Hester Baring. In common with many British films from the period, cameos abound. Ubiquitous actor[[Sam Kydd]] makes a brief appearance, screenwriter [[Bryan Forbes]] appears as a young officer co-opted to help intercept the kidnappers. Near the end of the film, Forbes has a bit part as a young Lieutenant who assists Harvey in the beach rescue of M. E.

Day movements, ''I Was Monty's Double'' also includes well-received performances by [[Leslie Phillips]], [[Michael Hordern]] as the governor of Gibraltar, \"Rusty\" Eastwood, [[Marius Goring]] as Karl Nielson and [[Barbara Hicks]] as Logan's formidably competent secretary, Hester Baring. In common with many British films from the period, cameos abound. Ubiquitous actor[[Sam Kydd]] makes a brief appearance, screenwriter [[Bryan Forbes]] appears as a young officer co-opted to help intercept the kidnappers. Near the end of the film, Forbes has a bit part as a young Lieutenant who assists Harvey in the beach rescue of M. E. Clifton James.\n\nNewsreel footage puts the real Field Marshal Montgomery in many scenes, but \"for a few key moments, James stands in for the real Monty.\"<ref>Axmaker, Sean.

In 1956, he released his first No. 1 country song, \"[[Singing the Blues]]\" and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" and \"[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]\". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\", \"[[Big Iron]]\" and \"Honkytonk Man\", the latter for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before death.\n\nOver the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], entered the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, having recently appeared in several contemporary pop culture features, including the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', and the series finale of [[AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. \n\n==Biography==\nRobbins was born in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], Arizona.

His father took odd jobs to support the family of 10 children, however his hard drinking led to divorce in 1937. Among his warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, Texas Bob Heckle, who was a local medicine man.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref> At 17, Robbins left his troubled home to serve in the [[United States Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].\n\nRobbins married Marizona \"Mari\" Baldwin on September 27, 1948. They had two children, Ronny and Janet, and were married 34 years until his death. \n\nAfter his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> then moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in Phoenix. After [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] made a [[guest appearance]] on Robbins' TV show, Dickens got Robbins a [[record deal]] with [[Columbia Records]]. \n\nRobbins became known for his appearances at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee. Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville.

Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the rock 'n' roll side of country in songs like ''White Sports Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbin |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''Hell on Wheels''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by NASCAR Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]].

His last race was in a [[Junior Johnson]]-built 1982 [[Buick Regal]] in the [[Atlanta Journal 500]] on November 7, 1982, a month before his death.\n\nRobbins developed  cardiovascular disease early in life. After his third heart attack on December 2, 1982, he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]]. He did not recover and died six days later, on December 8, at [[St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, Tennessee)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in Nashville.

[[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song \"God Speaks of Marty Robbins\".

Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song \"[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]\", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded \"You Gave Me a Mountain\" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of \"[[Big Iron]]\" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including \"I Couldn't Keep From Crying\", \"Kate\" and \"Song Of The Patriot\". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. \"Big Iron\" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\nHis song \"El Paso\" was featured in the series finale of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the BBC.\n\nRobbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].\n\nIn 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of Glendale, AZ was renamed \"[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ Marty Robbins Boulevard]\".\n\n== Political views ==\nMarty Robbins was strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in his political views. He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for \"Stars for Barry\". Two of his patriotic political singles, ''Ain't I Right'' and ''My Own Native Land'' were rejected by Columbia Records as too controversial. In particular, ''Ain't I Right'' was a right-wing protest song that condemned the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] and talked about fighting communism in the United States. After Columbia Records rejected the songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&pg=PA99&dq=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&hl=fi&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpu9-X_NTjAhXbAxAIHYCqD88Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=marty%20robbins%20aint%20i%20right&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n{{Infobox NASCAR driver\n|name               = \n|birth_date         = \n|birth_place        = \n|death_date         = \n|death_place        = \n|death_cause        = \n|Total_Cup_Races    = 35\n|Years_In_Cup       = 13\n|Best_Cup_Pos       = 48th ([[1974 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1974]])\n|First_Cup_Race     = [[1966 Nashville 400]] ([[Fairgrounds Speedway|Nashville]])\n|Last_Cup_Race      = [[1982 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1982]] [[AdvoCare 500 (Atlanta)|Atlanta Journal 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]])\n|Cup_Wins           = 0\n|Cup_Top_Tens       = 6\n|Cup_Poles          = 0\n|Total_GNEast_Races = 1\n|Years_In_GNEast    = 1\n|Best_GNEast_Pos    = \n|First_GNEast_Race  = 1972 Gamecock 200 ([[Columbia Speedway|Columbia]])\n|Last_GNEast_Race   = 1972 Gamecock 200 (Columbia)\n|GNEast_Wins        = 0\n|GNEast_Top_Tens    = 1\n|GNEast_Poles       = 0\n|updated            = August 19, 2016\n}}\nRobbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted.\n\nRobbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens.  Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes as well as a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973\u20131974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the NASCAR-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he \"just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage \u2013 Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nRobbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marty Robbins Saves Life of NASCAR's Richard Childress|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/marty-robbins-saves-life-of-nascars-richard-childress|website=Savingcountrymusic.com|accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].\n\nRobbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in Southern California and raced on the Vintage NASCAR club circuit.\n\nIn 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' NASCAR racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].\n\nFor the 2016 [[Darlington, South Carolina|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}\nRobbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.\n\nRobbins' highest charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" charted to #2, and in 1961, \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\" charted to #3.\n\nHis final Top 10 single was \"Honkytonk Man\" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

In 1956, he released his first No. 1 country song, \"[[Singing the Blues]]\" and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" and \"[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]\". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\", \"[[Big Iron]]\" and \"Honkytonk Man\", the latter for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before death.\n\nOver the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, having recently appeared in several contemporary pop culture features, including the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', and the series finale of [[AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. \n\n==Biography==\nRobbins was born in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], Arizona.

His father took odd jobs to support the family of 10 children, however his hard drinking led to divorce in 1937. Among his warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, Texas Bob Heckle, who was a local medicine man.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref> At 17, Robbins left his troubled home to serve in the [[United States Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].\n\nRobbins married Marizona \"Mari\" Baldwin on September 27, 1948. They had two children, Ronny and Janet, and were married 34 years until his death. \n\nAfter his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> then moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in Phoenix.

Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville.

Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the rock 'n' roll side of country in songs like ''White Sports Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbin |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''Hell on Wheels''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by NASCAR Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]].

For his contribution to the recording industry, Robbins has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].\n\nRobbins has been honored by many bands, including the [[Grateful Dead]] who covered \"El Paso\" and [[Bob Weir]] & Kingfish who covered \"Big Iron\". [[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song \"God Speaks of Marty Robbins\". The song's composer, [[Pete Townshend]], explained that the song is about God deciding to create the universe just so he can hear some music, \"and most of all, one of his best creations, Marty Robbins.\"<ref>[http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103040202/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr |date=January 3, 2007 }}</ref> The [[Beasts of Bourbon]] released a song called \"The Day Marty Robbins Died\" on their 1984 debut album ''The Axeman's Jazz''. Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song \"[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]\", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded \"You Gave Me a Mountain\" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of \"[[Big Iron]]\" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including \"I Couldn't Keep From Crying\", \"Kate\" and \"Song Of The Patriot\". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. \"Big Iron\" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\nHis song \"El Paso\" was featured in the series finale of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the BBC.\n\nRobbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].\n\nIn 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of Glendale, AZ was renamed \"[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ Marty Robbins Boulevard]\".\n\n== Political views ==\nMarty Robbins was strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in his political views. He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for \"Stars for Barry\". Two of his patriotic political singles, ''Ain't I Right'' and ''My Own Native Land'' were rejected by Columbia Records as too controversial. In particular, ''Ain't I Right'' was a right-wing protest song that condemned the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] and talked about fighting communism in the United States. After Columbia Records rejected the songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&pg=PA99&dq=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&hl=fi&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpu9-X_NTjAhXbAxAIHYCqD88Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=marty%20robbins%20aint%20i%20right&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n{{Infobox NASCAR driver\n|name               = \n|birth_date         = \n|birth_place        = \n|death_date         = \n|death_place        = \n|death_cause        = \n|Total_Cup_Races    = 35\n|Years_In_Cup       = 13\n|Best_Cup_Pos       = 48th ([[1974 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1974]])\n|First_Cup_Race     = [[1966 Nashville 400]] ([[Fairgrounds Speedway|Nashville]])\n|Last_Cup_Race      = [[1982 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1982]] [[AdvoCare 500 (Atlanta)|Atlanta Journal 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]])\n|Cup_Wins           = 0\n|Cup_Top_Tens       = 6\n|Cup_Poles          = 0\n|Total_GNEast_Races = 1\n|Years_In_GNEast    = 1\n|Best_GNEast_Pos    = \n|First_GNEast_Race  = 1972 Gamecock 200 ([[Columbia Speedway|Columbia]])\n|Last_GNEast_Race   = 1972 Gamecock 200 (Columbia)\n|GNEast_Wins        = 0\n|GNEast_Top_Tens    = 1\n|GNEast_Poles       = 0\n|updated            = August 19, 2016\n}}\nRobbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted.\n\nRobbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens.  Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes as well as a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973\u20131974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the NASCAR-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he \"just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage \u2013 Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nRobbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marty Robbins Saves Life of NASCAR's Richard Childress|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/marty-robbins-saves-life-of-nascars-richard-childress|website=Savingcountrymusic.com|accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].\n\nRobbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in Southern California and raced on the Vintage NASCAR club circuit.\n\nIn 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' NASCAR racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].\n\nFor the 2016 [[Darlington, South Carolina|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}\nRobbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.\n\nRobbins' highest charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" charted to #2, and in 1961, \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\" charted to #3.\n\nHis final Top 10 single was \"Honkytonk Man\" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

The prize for the winning team is the Dan Breen Cup. Initially played as a knock-out competition on a divisional basis, the championship currently features a group stage followed by a knock-out stage.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other four hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\n32 teams currently participate in the Tipperary County Championship. The title has been won at least once by 25 different teams.

County committees were quickly established, with the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary County Board]] affiliating in 1886. Over the course of the following year, 130 clubs registered with the GAA in Tipperary, making it the strongest county in the country. After difficulties in organising the early championships, the title has been awarded every year except on one occasion since 1894. Civil unrest at the height of the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] resulted in the 1920 championship being cancelled.\n\n===Team dominance===\n\nSince the beginning, the championship has seen periods of dominance by various teams. [[Boherlahen-Dualla GAA|Tubberadora]] became the preeminent team  of the first decade, before being superseded by [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]. After winning the inaugural title in 1887, the [[Thurles]]-based club won six championships from a possible nine between 1904 and 1911. [[Toomevara GAA|Toomevara]] made their first big breakthrough in 1910 and won titles at regular intervals over the course of the next twenty years. [[Boherlahen-Dualla GAA|Boherlahen-Dualla]] won the first of four successive championship titles in 1915 and won a grand total of ten up to and including the 1941 championship. Thurles Sarsfields bounced back in 1929 after an eleven-year period in the doldrums. Over the course of the next 45 years the club established itself as the standard bearer of club hurling in Tipperary by winning 21 titles during this period. The club reached its peak by winning ten titles in eleven championship seasons between 1955 and 1965. [[Roscrea GAA|Roscrea]] won their first championship in 1968 before completing a three-in-a-row in 1970. The club won further titles in 1972, 1973 and 1980. [[Moneygall GAA|Moneygall]] and [[Kilruane MacDonagh's GAA|Kilruane MacDonagh's]] shared five titles between 1975 and 1979, while [[Borris-Ileigh GAA|Borris-Ileigh]] won three titles throughout the 1980s. After failing to win a championship in over thirty years, Toomevara returned to the top table in 1992. Over the course of the next sixteen years the club claimed 11 championship titles. Thurles Sarsfields also returned to their winning ways after a 31-year barren spell by claiming the 2005 championship. They have since become the most successful team of the 21st century by winning eight championships.\n\n==Format==\n\nThe Tipperary senior hurling championship is probably the most complicated system in Ireland as it has striven to accommodate from 25 to, currently, 32 teams. A knockout divisional system and group backdoor system has been introduced to accommodate these teams. Before the new system, the county championship was run on a divisional basis with the teams in the divisional finals going into the county quarter-finals and proceeding from there.\n\nA new format is to be introduced in 2014 with the county championship divided into two sections of 16 teams each, the sections determined by clubs' placings in the 2013 championship. Each section will be divided into four groups of four teams with games played on a round robin basis. The top two teams in each Section 1 group, and the top team in each Section 2 group, qualify for the knockout stages, as do the four divisional champions. The bottom team in each Section 1 group is relegated to Section 2, and the top team in each Section 2 group is promoted to Section 1. The bottom teams in each of the Section 2 groups face relegation play-offs, with two teams relegated to the [[Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship|Intermediate Championship]]. The Intermediate champions move up to Section 2. Thus in 2015 there will be 31 teams in the Senior Championship.<ref>[http://tipperary.gaa.ie/latestnews/tipperarygaascene-january22nd2013 Tipperary GAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125235935/http://tipperary.gaa.ie/latestnews/tipperarygaascene-january22nd2013 |date=2013-01-25 }} website, \"Latest News\", 22 January 2013</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\n\nFor four years between 2013 and 2016, the championship was sponsored by Clean Ireland Recycling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalist.ie/news/gaelic-games/141462/Clean-Ireland-Recycling-in-new-sponsorship.html|title=Clean Ireland Recycling in new sponsorship deal|publisher=The Nationalist|date=27 June 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018|first=|last=}}</ref> In August 2016, the Tipperary County Board announced that they had signed a three-year sponsorship deal with [[Tipperary Water]].

All games from the quarter-finals onward are played at [[Semple Stadium]].\n\n=== Final ===\n\nThe final is usually played at Semple Stadium, previously Thurles Sportsfield.\n\n==Managers==\n\n[[Manager (Gaelic Games)|Managers]] in the Tipperary Championship are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players.

reasons as the '''Tipperary Water Tipperary County Senior Hurling Championship''') is an annual [[hurling]] competition organised by the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary County Board]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] since 1887 for the top hurling teams in the [[County Tipperary|county of Tipperary]] in [[Ireland]].\n\nThe series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at [[Semple Stadium]] in October. The prize for the winning team is the Dan Breen Cup. Initially played as a knock-out competition on a divisional basis, the championship currently features a group stage followed by a knock-out stage.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other four hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\n32 teams currently participate in the Tipperary County Championship. The title has been won at least once by 25 different teams. The all-time record-holders are [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]], who have won a total of 36 titles.\n\n[[Clonoulty-Rossmore GAA|Clonoulty-Rossmore]] won the [[2018 Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship|2018 Championship]], their first championship since 1997 after a 0-23 to 2-13 win against [[Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g GAA|Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g]] in the final.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/1021/1005701-clonoulty-rossmore-end-21-year-wait-for-tipp-glory/ |title =Clonoulty-Rossmore end 21-year wait for Tipp glory|date=21 October 2018|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/1021/1005747-the-gaa-club-is-the-lifeblood-of-the-whole-of-ireland/ |title ='The GAA club is the lifeblood of the whole of Ireland'|date=21 October 2018|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gaa/clonoulty-rossmore-win-first-title-in-21-years-after-thrilling-final-success-877207.html |title =Clonoulty-Rossmore win first title in 21 years after thrilling final success|date=21 October 2018|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n\nFollowing the foundation of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884, new rules for [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] were drawn up and published in the ''[[United Irishman (1848 newspaper)|United Irishman]]'' newspaper. County committees were quickly established, with the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary County Board]] affiliating in 1886. Over the course of the following year, 130 clubs registered with the GAA in Tipperary, making it the strongest county in the country. After difficulties in organising the early championships, the title has been awarded every year except on one occasion since 1894. Civil unrest at the height of the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] resulted in the 1920 championship being cancelled.\n\n===Team dominance===\n\nSince the beginning, the championship has seen periods of dominance by various teams. [[Boherlahen-Dualla GAA|Tubberadora]] became the preeminent team  of the first decade, before being superseded by [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]. After winning the inaugural title in 1887, the [[Thurles]]-based club won six championships from a possible nine between 1904 and 1911. [[Toomevara GAA|Toomevara]] made their first big breakthrough in 1910 and won titles at regular intervals over the course of the next twenty years. [[Boherlahen-Dualla GAA|Boherlahen-Dualla]] won the first of four successive championship titles in 1915 and won a grand total of ten up to and including the 1941 championship. Thurles Sarsfields bounced back in 1929 after an eleven-year period in the doldrums. Over the course of the next 45 years the club established itself as the standard bearer of club hurling in Tipperary by winning 21 titles during this period. The club reached its peak by winning ten titles in eleven championship seasons between 1955 and 1965. [[Roscrea GAA|Roscrea]] won their first championship in 1968 before completing a three-in-a-row in 1970. The club won further titles in 1972, 1973 and 1980. [[Moneygall GAA|Moneygall]] and [[Kilruane MacDonagh's GAA|Kilruane MacDonagh's]] shared five titles between 1975 and 1979, while [[Borris-Ileigh GAA|Borris-Ileigh]] won three titles throughout the 1980s. After failing to win a championship in over thirty years, Toomevara returned to the top table in 1992. Over the course of the next sixteen years the club claimed 11 championship titles. Thurles Sarsfields also returned to their winning ways after a 31-year barren spell by claiming the 2005 championship. They have since become the most successful team of the 21st century by winning eight championships.\n\n==Format==\n\nThe Tipperary senior hurling championship is probably the most complicated system in Ireland as it has striven to accommodate from 25 to, currently, 32 teams. A knockout divisional system and group backdoor system has been introduced to accommodate these teams. Before the new system, the county championship was run on a divisional basis with the teams in the divisional finals going into the county quarter-finals and proceeding from there.\n\nA new format is to be introduced in 2014 with the county championship divided into two sections of 16 teams each, the sections determined by clubs' placings in the 2013 championship. Each section will be divided into four groups of four teams with games played on a round robin basis. The top two teams in each Section 1 group, and the top team in each Section 2 group, qualify for the knockout stages, as do the four divisional champions. The bottom team in each Section 1 group is relegated to Section 2, and the top team in each Section 2 group is promoted to Section 1. The bottom teams in each of the Section 2 groups face relegation play-offs, with two teams relegated to the [[Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship|Intermediate Championship]]. The Intermediate champions move up to Section 2.
