After the [[2012 APFL season|2012 season]], most of the teams left to start the [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]]. The league consisted of professional and [[semi-professional]] teams, with a few core teams that played a full 10 game schedule and other teams that played partial schedules. At the end of each season, the playoffs were contested between the league's core teams. The first few years of league play were dominated by the [[Kansas Koyotes]], but in later years the league had more parity and more stable members, resulting in the first championship won by another team, the [[Iowa Blackhawks]] (in [[2009 APFL season|2009]]), and the first championship game not involving the Koyotes, when the Iowa Blackhawks defended their championship against the Mid-Missouri Outlaws in the [[2010 APFL season]].\n\n==League membership==\n* [[Beaumont Drillers]] (2008)\n* [[Cheyenne Warriors]] (2012)\n* Chillicothe Lumberjacks (2003, never played)<ref name=\"2003SCHED\"/>\n* Colorado Lightning (2012)\n* Colorado Stars (2004, never played)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040807072321/http://koyotefootball.com/schedule.html Colorado Stars]</ref>\n* [[Conroe Storm]] (2007&ndash;2008)\n* [[Council Bluffs Express]] (2012)\n* Denver Titans (2009)\n* [[Florida Scorpions]] (2008&ndash;2009, 2011)\n* [[Iowa Blackhawks]] (2004&ndash;2011)\n* Kansas City Matadors (2011)\n* [[Kansas Koyotes]] (2003&ndash;2012)\n* [[Kansas/St. Joseph Storm]] (2005)<sup>a</sup> <ref>[https://archive.is/20130127191402/http://www.leaguelineup.com/ksstorm Kansas/St. Joseph Storm]</ref>\n* [[Mid-Missouri Outlaws]] (2010&ndash;2012)\n* [[Missouri Minutemen]] (2003&ndash;2008)\n* Nebraska Bears (2005)<ref name=\"2005SCHED\">\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20050406043910/http://www.koyotefootball.com/schedule.html 2005 Schedule]</ref>\n* [[Nebraska Extreme]]/Tornadoes (2008&ndash;2009)\n* Nebraska Wildcats (2006)\n* [[North Texas Crunch]] (2013&ndash;2014)\n* [[Oklahoma Defenders]] (2012)\n* [[Sioux City Bandits]] (2011&ndash;2012)\n* Springfield Shield (2008, never played)\n* St. Joseph Explorers (2003)<ref name=\"2003SCHED\">\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20031001041822/http://www.koyotefootball.com/schedule.html 2003 Schedule]</ref>\n* [[Springfield Wolfpack]] (2007&ndash;2012)\n* [[Fort Worth Regulators|Texas Regulators]] (2007&ndash;2008)\n* [[Texas Thunder (football)|Texas Thunder]] (2004)<ref name=\"2004SCHED\">\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20040411174951/http://www.koyotefootball.com/schedule.html 2004 Schedule]</ref>\n* [[Wichita Aviators]] (2005&ndash;2006)\n* [[Wichita Falls Diablos]] (2008)\n* [[La Crosse Night Train|Wisconsin Locomotives]] (2004, never played)<ref name=\"2004SCHED\"/>\n\n<small>a.

forfeit\n\n==History==\n\n===2003===\nEarly in 2003, the APFL started as a regional league with the Kansas Koyotes, Missouri Minutemen, St. Joseph Explorers, and Chillicothe Lumberjacks. However, the Lumberjacks didn't make it to opening day and as a result the league played on with three teams while Chillicothe was replaced on the schedule. The Koyotes went undefeated in the league's first season and won the championship game in a rout against Missouri, their 4th victory over the Minutemen that season.\n\n===2004===\nKansas and Missouri returned and the league added the Iowa Blackhawks and Texas Thunder. The Colorado Stars and Wisconsin Locomotives were originally scheduled to compete, but neither played a down of football in the APFL. The Blackhawks were previously the River City Redemption, who had competed in an exhibition match against the Koyotes the season before. Texas only played a partial schedule. The Koyotes and Minutemen both made it back to the championship, and the Koyotes rolled to a second championship and undefeated season.\n\n===2005===\nThe 2005 season saw the addition of the Kansas Storm, Nebraska Bears, and Wichita Aviators. The Thunder did not return and the league played with six teams. The league saw an increase in competition with these new teams and an improved team in Iowa. The Koyotes again captured the #1 seed and an undefeated regular season but had to win more close games than the previous two seasons. The Minutemen, twice the APFL runner-up, did not even make the playoffs. Iowa hosted Wichita in the semi-final and won 50-42 to earn a berth in the championship game. In a thrilling final, the Koyotes almost saw the championship slip away when the Blackhawks took a late lead. Jerry Lakin hit a game-winning field goal and Kansas completed their third consecutive undefeated season with a 26-24 win.\n\n===2006===\nThe Nebraska Bears did not return the next year and the Nebraska Wildcats were added as a travel-only team. The Kansas Storm attempted to move to St. Joseph, Missouri but ended up not playing in 2006, causing the league to find replacements for their games on the schedule. The 2006 season started with a bang when Kansas finally lost, dropping their season opener against Wichita 50-43. The Aviators were the APFL regular season champions and had earned the right to host the championship game. After Kansas won their semi-final against the Blackhawks, the league decided to move the championship game to Landon Arena, home of the Koyotes. This controversial decision caused Wichita to boycott the championship game, resulting in a forfeit win for the Kansas Koyotes and leading to Wichita's exit from the league.\n\n===2007===\nThe MAIFL champion Springfield Wolfpack and two new teams from Texas, the Conroe Storm and Fort Worth Regulators, joined the league for the 2007 season. The Regulators couldn't secure a home arena, and they [[Travel team|only played road games]] in 2007. Conroe had a strong debut season, finishing 2nd in the regular season and earning a home playoff game. The season ended when they were upset in the semi-final by the visiting Blackhawks. Iowa's second championship appearance also ended in defeat, and the Koyotes claimed a 5th championship with a 39-15 victory.\n\n===2008===\nThe APFL expanded ambitiously in 2008 to 10 teams, and split its teams into divisions for the first time. The Nebraska Extreme joined Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Springfield in the Northern Division. The Wichita Falls Diablos and former NIFL members Beaumont Drillers and Florida Scorpions joined Conroe and Fort Worth in the Southern Division. The expansion was a flop and led to a disastrous season for the league. Arena problems and mismanagement plagued many teams throughout the league, resulting in a cancellation of the entire season for Ft. Worth. None of the Southern teams played more than half their schedule, and all of the teams in that division had either folded or were on the verge of folding by season's end. In the North, Nebraska and Missouri didn't have home arenas, but most of the scheduled games went on as planned. Kansas defeated Iowa in the Northern semi-final, and the Southern semi-final wasn't played but Beaumont went on to the APFL championship. With few of their original players available, the Drillers still traveled to Topeka for the championship and lost 62\u201336. The Drillers played better than many{{who|date=August 2011}} had expected them to given the circumstances, but it wasn't enough to stop the Koyotes from taking their sixth championship.\n\n===2009===\nIn the 2009 season, all of the teams from the North except Missouri returned, and Florida was the only surviving member of the South. The Scorpions continued to play in the league as a travel-only team, as did the renamed Nebraska Tornadoes and new member Denver Titans. The core teams of Iowa, Kansas and Springfield played full schedules and participated in the playoffs. The Koyotes continued their streak of championship game appearances by defeating the Wolfpack in the semi-final. For the first time the championship was not held in Topeka when the regular season champion Blackhawks hosted the Koyotes. Iowa blew out Kansas 63-17 to earn their first championship.\n\n===2010===\nThe Junction City Force and Mid-Missouri Outlaws joined the league in 2010. Junction City joined as a travel-only team and primarily played in the Central Plains Football League. The Outlaws came to the league after winning the CPFL title three years in a row and were also notable for defeating the Blackhawks in a matchup during the 2009 season. Iowa won the regular season title once again, and Mid-Missouri came in second during an impressive debut season. Kansas suffered through their worst season to date, finishing in 4th. The Koyotes won their play-in game against the Force, but lost to the Blackhawks in the semi-final. The Outlaws defeated the Wolfpack in the other semi-final, and the top two teams faced off in the championship. In the first championship game to go to overtime, Iowa came away with the victory on a game-winning kick from Jerry Lakin in a 31-28 thriller.\n\n===2011===\nIn October 2010, the Sioux City Bandits announced that they were leaving the [[Indoor Football League]] for the APFL. In February 2011 the league added the Florida Scorpions and Kansas City Matadors as provisional members to fill out their 2011 schedule. That year, the Sioux City Bandits defeated the Kansas City Matadors 112-0.\n\n===2012===\nThe Sioux City Bandits once again ended the season undefeated, up to the playoffs, with a 12-0 record.\n\n===2013===\nAfter the 2012 season, several teams left to start the Champions Professional Indoor Football League, including the Kansas Koyotes, which was sold off. An attempt was made at a 2013 season, but only one team, North Texas Crunch, played any kind of schedule. In 2015, the Crunch became one of four teams to join the [[North American Indoor Football League (2015)|North American Indoor Football League]] for its inaugural season.<ref name=\"abqj150418s\">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Christ |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |location=[[Albuquerque, NM]] |title=Stars announce plans to play in upstart indoor league in 2016 |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/571398/sports/stars-announce-plans-to-play-in-upstart-indoor-league-in-2016.html |date=April 18, 2015 |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Professional Gridiron football leagues}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct indoor American football leagues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|National Football League}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n|current_season=\n|logo = APFL-logo.png\n|pixels = 200px\n|sport = [[Indoor American football|Indoor football]]\n|founded = 2003\n|folded = 2013\n|country = United States\n|champion = [[Sioux City Bandits]]\n| most_champs     = [[Kansas Koyotes]] (6)\n| President       = Ralph Adams\n| Director        = Ted Adams\n|related_comps    = [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]]<br>[[Continental Indoor Football League]]<br>[[Indoor Football League]]<br>[[Ultimate Indoor Football League]]\n|website=[http://www.apflfootball.com]\n}}\n\n\n\nThe '''American Professional Football League''' ('''APFL''') was an [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] league that was founded in [[2003 APFL season|2003]].

forfeit\n\n==History==\n\n===2003===\nEarly in 2003, the APFL started as a regional league with the Kansas Koyotes, Missouri Minutemen, St. Joseph Explorers, and Chillicothe Lumberjacks. However, the Lumberjacks didn't make it to opening day and as a result the league played on with three teams while Chillicothe was replaced on the schedule. The Koyotes went undefeated in the league's first season and won the championship game in a rout against Missouri, their 4th victory over the Minutemen that season.\n\n===2004===\nKansas and Missouri returned and the league added the Iowa Blackhawks and Texas Thunder. The Colorado Stars and Wisconsin Locomotives were originally scheduled to compete, but neither played a down of football in the APFL. The Blackhawks were previously the River City Redemption, who had competed in an exhibition match against the Koyotes the season before. Texas only played a partial schedule. The Koyotes and Minutemen both made it back to the championship, and the Koyotes rolled to a second championship and undefeated season.\n\n===2005===\nThe 2005 season saw the addition of the Kansas Storm, Nebraska Bears, and Wichita Aviators. The Thunder did not return and the league played with six teams. The league saw an increase in competition with these new teams and an improved team in Iowa. The Koyotes again captured the #1 seed and an undefeated regular season but had to win more close games than the previous two seasons. The Minutemen, twice the APFL runner-up, did not even make the playoffs. Iowa hosted Wichita in the semi-final and won 50-42 to earn a berth in the championship game. In a thrilling final, the Koyotes almost saw the championship slip away when the Blackhawks took a late lead. Jerry Lakin hit a game-winning field goal and Kansas completed their third consecutive undefeated season with a 26-24 win.\n\n===2006===\nThe Nebraska Bears did not return the next year and the Nebraska Wildcats were added as a travel-only team. The Kansas Storm attempted to move to St. Joseph, Missouri but ended up not playing in 2006, causing the league to find replacements for their games on the schedule. The 2006 season started with a bang when Kansas finally lost, dropping their season opener against Wichita 50-43. The Aviators were the APFL regular season champions and had earned the right to host the championship game. After Kansas won their semi-final against the Blackhawks, the league decided to move the championship game to Landon Arena, home of the Koyotes. This controversial decision caused Wichita to boycott the championship game, resulting in a forfeit win for the Kansas Koyotes and leading to Wichita's exit from the league.\n\n===2007===\nThe MAIFL champion Springfield Wolfpack and two new teams from Texas, the Conroe Storm and Fort Worth Regulators, joined the league for the 2007 season. The Regulators couldn't secure a home arena, and they [[Travel team|only played road games]] in 2007. Conroe had a strong debut season, finishing 2nd in the regular season and earning a home playoff game. The season ended when they were upset in the semi-final by the visiting Blackhawks. Iowa's second championship appearance also ended in defeat, and the Koyotes claimed a 5th championship with a 39-15 victory.\n\n===2008===\nThe APFL expanded ambitiously in 2008 to 10 teams, and split its teams into divisions for the first time. The Nebraska Extreme joined Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Springfield in the Northern Division. The Wichita Falls Diablos and former NIFL members Beaumont Drillers and Florida Scorpions joined Conroe and Fort Worth in the Southern Division. The expansion was a flop and led to a disastrous season for the league. Arena problems and mismanagement plagued many teams throughout the league, resulting in a cancellation of the entire season for Ft. Worth. None of the Southern teams played more than half their schedule, and all of the teams in that division had either folded or were on the verge of folding by season's end. In the North, Nebraska and Missouri didn't have home arenas, but most of the scheduled games went on as planned. Kansas defeated Iowa in the Northern semi-final, and the Southern semi-final wasn't played but Beaumont went on to the APFL championship. With few of their original players available, the Drillers still traveled to Topeka for the championship and lost 62\u201336. The Drillers played better than many{{who|date=August 2011}} had expected them to given the circumstances, but it wasn't enough to stop the Koyotes from taking their sixth championship.\n\n===2009===\nIn the 2009 season, all of the teams from the North except Missouri returned, and Florida was the only surviving member of the South. The Scorpions continued to play in the league as a travel-only team, as did the renamed Nebraska Tornadoes and new member Denver Titans. The core teams of Iowa, Kansas and Springfield played full schedules and participated in the playoffs. The Koyotes continued their streak of championship game appearances by defeating the Wolfpack in the semi-final. For the first time the championship was not held in Topeka when the regular season champion Blackhawks hosted the Koyotes. Iowa blew out Kansas 63-17 to earn their first championship.\n\n===2010===\nThe Junction City Force and Mid-Missouri Outlaws joined the league in 2010. Junction City joined as a travel-only team and primarily played in the Central Plains Football League. The Outlaws came to the league after winning the CPFL title three years in a row and were also notable for defeating the Blackhawks in a matchup during the 2009 season. Iowa won the regular season title once again, and Mid-Missouri came in second during an impressive debut season. Kansas suffered through their worst season to date, finishing in 4th. The Koyotes won their play-in game against the Force, but lost to the Blackhawks in the semi-final. The Outlaws defeated the Wolfpack in the other semi-final, and the top two teams faced off in the championship. In the first championship game to go to overtime, Iowa came away with the victory on a game-winning kick from Jerry Lakin in a 31-28 thriller.\n\n===2011===\nIn October 2010, the Sioux City Bandits announced that they were leaving the [[Indoor Football League]] for the APFL. In February 2011 the league added the Florida Scorpions and Kansas City Matadors as provisional members to fill out their 2011 schedule. That year, the Sioux City Bandits defeated the Kansas City Matadors 112-0.\n\n===2012===\nThe Sioux City Bandits once again ended the season undefeated, up to the playoffs, with a 12-0 record.\n\n===2013===\nAfter the 2012 season, several teams left to start the Champions Professional Indoor Football League, including the Kansas Koyotes, which was sold off. An attempt was made at a 2013 season, but only one team, North Texas Crunch, played any kind of schedule. In 2015, the Crunch became one of four teams to join the [[North American Indoor Football League (2015)|North American Indoor Football League]] for its inaugural season.<ref name=\"abqj150418s\">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Christ |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |location=[[Albuquerque, NM]] |title=Stars announce plans to play in upstart indoor league in 2016 |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/571398/sports/stars-announce-plans-to-play-in-upstart-indoor-league-in-2016.html |date=April 18, 2015 |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Professional Gridiron football leagues}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct indoor American football leagues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines]]\n", "name_user": "Mjmja5", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Professional_Football_League"}

Thus: call it son of Fornj\u00f3t, Brother of the Sea and of Fire, Scathe or Ruin or Hound or Wolf of the Wood or of the Sail or of the Rigging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thus spake Svein in the ''Nordrsetu-dr\u00e1pa'':\n<blockquote>First began to fly<br>\nFornj\u00f3t's sons ill-shapen.</blockquote></blockquote>\nFornj\u00f3t is listed as a giant (''[[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tun]]'') in one of the ''thulur'' sometimes included in editions of the ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l''. This is as expected, since Fornj\u00f3t's son \u00c6gir is also identified as a giant in various sources.\n\nIn the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'' and in ''[[Hversu Noregr byggdist]]'' ('How Norway was settled')&mdash; both found in the ''[[Flatey Book]]''&mdash; Fornj\u00f3t appears as the ancient ruler of ''Jotlandi, later known as Kv\u00e6nlandi and Finnlandi\"''. He is father of three sons named \u00c6gir or Hl\u00e9r, Logi and K\u00e1ri. The ''Hversu'' account says further that \u00c6gir ruled over the seas, Logi over fire, and K\u00e1ri over wind.\n\n==\u00c6gir==\n{{Main|\u00c6gir}}\n\n==Logi==\n{{Main|Logi}}\n\n===In ''Gylfaginning''===\nLogi appears by that name in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' in the tale of [[Thor]] and [[Loki]]'s journey to the castle of the giant [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]] where Loki was pitted against Logi in an eating contest. The contestants appeared to be equal in speed at eating meat from the bone, but Logi also consumed the bones and even the wooden [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]] in which the meat was placed. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki afterwards explained that Logi was really fire itself.\n\n===In the ''Saga of Thorstein V\u00edking's son''===\nThe beginning of ''[[\u00deorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar]]'' ('Saga of Thorstein son of V\u00edking') brings in a king named Logi who ruled the country north of [[Norway]]. Logi was the handsomest of men, but with the strength and size of the giants from whom he was descended.  (Logi's ancestry is here not otherwise specified.) Because Logi was larger and stronger than any other man in land, his name was lengthened from Logi to '''H\u00e1logi''' ('High-Logi') and from that name the country was called H\u00e1logaland 'H\u00e1logi's-land' (modern [[H\u00e5logaland]] or Halogaland).\n\nThe saga tells that H\u00e1logi's wife was Gl\u00f6d (''Gl\u01eb\u00f0'' 'glad'), the daughter of Gr\u00edm (''Gr\u00edmr'') of Gr\u00edmsgard (''Gr\u00edmsgar\u00f0r'') in [[Jotunheim|J\u00f6tunheim]] in the far north and her mother was Alv\u00f6r (''Alv\u01ebr'') the sister of King \u00c1lf the Old ('\u00c1lfr hinn gamli') of [[\u00c1lfheim]]. Or perhaps, the name of H\u00e1logi's wife should be rendered instead as Gl\u00f3d (''Gl\u00f3\u00f0'' 'red-hot embers') if this Logi is indeed either identical or confused with Logi as a personification of fire. The names of his daughters in this account were Eisa 'glowing embers' and Eimyrja 'embers', the fairest women in the land, whose names were later applied to the things which became their meaning, certain indication of the original fiery nature of their father. (Wife and daughters are sometimes wrongly ascribed to Loki rather than Logi in secondary sources.)\n\nTwo of H\u00e1logi's jarls named V\u00e9seti and V\u00edfil (''V\u00edfill'') abducted H\u00e1logi's daughters and fled the country. At that point H\u00e1logi is out of the story. V\u00e9seti settled in Borgundarh\u00f3lm ([[Bornholm]]) where Eisa bore him two sons named B\u00fai and Sigurd Cape (''Sigur\u00f0r K\u00e1pa''). V\u00edfil fled farther east to an island named V\u00edfilsey 'V\u00edfil's Isle' where Eimyrja bore him a son named [[Viking (Norse Mythology)|V\u00edking]] (''V\u00edkingr'') who was father of Thorstein (''\u00deorsteinn'') the hero of the saga. V\u00edking is made out to be a contemporary of a King \u00d3laf (''\u00d3lafr'') who is said to be the brother of King [[Anund|\u00d6nund]] (''\u01eanundr'') of [[Sweden]]. Descendants of Thorstein appear in ''Fridthj\u00f3fs saga ins fr\u00e6kna'' (''Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga ins fr\u00e6kna'' 'Saga of Fridthjof the Bold') and in the [[Starkad]] section of ''[[Gautreks saga]]'' 'Gautrek's saga'.\n\nThis account cannot be reconiciled with the account in the ''Hversu'' and ''Orkneyinga saga'' without assuming multiple figures with the same names. In ''Thorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar'', Logi (a descendant of giants) is the husband to a niece of King \u00c1lf the Old of \u00c1lfheim who himself is the husband of Bergd\u00eds the daughter of King Raum (''Raumr'') of Raumar\u00edki. In the other accounts Logi is the brother of K\u00e1ri who is a distant ancestor of [[Raum the Old]] who is father of \u00c1lf or Finn\u00e1lf (''Finn\u00e1lfr''), king of \u00c1lfheim.\n\n==K\u00e1ri==\nK\u00e1ri is mentioned in one of the ''thulur'' as a term for wind. Otherwise this personage appears only in the ''Hversu'' and ''Orkneyinga saga'' accounts where K\u00e1ri appears to be the heir to his father's kingdoms as in the ''Hversu'' K\u00e1ri's descendants emerge also as rulers of ''\"K\u00e6nlandi and Finnlandi\"''. K\u00e1ri is father of a son who is named Frosti ('frost') according to the ''Orkneyinga saga'' but named J\u00f6kul (''j\u01ebkull'': 'icicle, ice, glacier') according to the ''Hversu''. This son in turn is the father of Sn\u00e6r the Old (''Sn\u00e6rr inn gamli'' 'Snow the Old').\n\nSee '''[[Sn\u00e6r]]''' to follow this lineage further.\n\n==More traditions about Frosti and Logi==\nIn the [[Ynglinga saga]] the names Logi and Frosti are otherwise connected when it relates that King [[Agne]] of [[Sweden]] in a raid on Finland killed Frosti, the leader of the Finns who opposed him and captured Skj\u00e1lf, Frosti's daughter, and her brother Logi. (But the verse of the ''Ynglingtal'' quoted here as confirmation says only that Skj\u00e1lf is Logi's kin.) Skj\u00e1lf married to Agni and avenged her father by arranging to have Agni hanged. Agni himself, as discussed under '''[[Sn\u00e6r]]''', is here a descendant of Sn\u00e6r through Sn\u00e6r's daughter Dr\u00edfa who married King [[Vanlade|Vanlandi]] of Sweden.\n\n===As an ancestor of the House of Yngling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThis is the mythic [[Yngling]] family tree based on ''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]'', ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', ''[[Beowulf]]'' and other [[Old Norse]] sources.

Thus: call it son of Fornj\u00f3t, Brother of the Sea and of Fire, Scathe or Ruin or Hound or Wolf of the Wood or of the Sail or of the Rigging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thus spake Svein in the ''Nordrsetu-dr\u00e1pa'':\n<blockquote>First began to fly<br>\nFornj\u00f3t's sons ill-shapen.</blockquote></blockquote>\nFornj\u00f3t is listed as a giant (''[[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tun]]'') in one of the ''thulur'' sometimes included in editions of the ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l''. This is as expected, since Fornj\u00f3t's son \u00c6gir is also identified as a giant in various sources.\n\nIn the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'' and in ''[[Hversu Noregr byggdist]]'' ('How Norway was settled')&mdash; both found in the ''[[Flatey Book]]''&mdash; Fornj\u00f3t appears as the ancient ruler of ''Jotlandi, later known as Kv\u00e6nlandi and Finnlandi\"''. He is father of three sons named \u00c6gir or Hl\u00e9r, Logi and K\u00e1ri. The ''Hversu'' account says further that \u00c6gir ruled over the seas, Logi over fire, and K\u00e1ri over wind.\n\n==\u00c6gir==\n{{Main|\u00c6gir}}\n\n==Logi==\n{{Main|Logi}}\n\n===In ''Gylfaginning''===\nLogi appears by that name in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' in the tale of [[Thor]] and [[Loki]]'s journey to the castle of the giant [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]] where Loki was pitted against Logi in an eating contest. The contestants appeared to be equal in speed at eating meat from the bone, but Logi also consumed the bones and even the wooden [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]] in which the meat was placed. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki afterwards explained that Logi was really fire itself.\n\n===In the ''Saga of Thorstein V\u00edking's son''===\nThe beginning of ''[[\u00deorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar]]'' ('Saga of Thorstein son of V\u00edking') brings in a king named Logi who ruled the country north of [[Norway]]. Logi was the handsomest of men, but with the strength and size of the giants from whom he was descended.  (Logi's ancestry is here not otherwise specified.) Because Logi was larger and stronger than any other man in land, his name was lengthened from Logi to '''H\u00e1logi''' ('High-Logi') and from that name the country was called H\u00e1logaland 'H\u00e1logi's-land' (modern [[H\u00e5logaland]] or Halogaland).\n\nThe saga tells that H\u00e1logi's wife was Gl\u00f6d (''Gl\u01eb\u00f0'' 'glad'), the daughter of Gr\u00edm (''Gr\u00edmr'') of Gr\u00edmsgard (''Gr\u00edmsgar\u00f0r'') in [[Jotunheim|J\u00f6tunheim]] in the far north and her mother was Alv\u00f6r (''Alv\u01ebr'') the sister of King \u00c1lf the Old ('\u00c1lfr hinn gamli') of [[\u00c1lfheim]]. Or perhaps, the name of H\u00e1logi's wife should be rendered instead as Gl\u00f3d (''Gl\u00f3\u00f0'' 'red-hot embers') if this Logi is indeed either identical or confused with Logi as a personification of fire. The names of his daughters in this account were Eisa 'glowing embers' and Eimyrja 'embers', the fairest women in the land, whose names were later applied to the things which became their meaning, certain indication of the original fiery nature of their father. (Wife and daughters are sometimes wrongly ascribed to Loki rather than Logi in secondary sources.)\n\nTwo of H\u00e1logi's jarls named V\u00e9seti and V\u00edfil (''V\u00edfill'') abducted H\u00e1logi's daughters and fled the country. At that point H\u00e1logi is out of the story. V\u00e9seti settled in Borgundarh\u00f3lm ([[Bornholm]]) where Eisa bore him two sons named B\u00fai and Sigurd Cape (''Sigur\u00f0r K\u00e1pa''). V\u00edfil fled farther east to an island named V\u00edfilsey 'V\u00edfil's Isle' where Eimyrja bore him a son named [[Viking (Norse Mythology)|V\u00edking]] (''V\u00edkingr'') who was father of Thorstein (''\u00deorsteinn'') the hero of the saga. V\u00edking is made out to be a contemporary of a King \u00d3laf (''\u00d3lafr'') who is said to be the brother of King [[Anund|\u00d6nund]] (''\u01eanundr'') of [[Sweden]]. Descendants of Thorstein appear in ''Fridthj\u00f3fs saga ins fr\u00e6kna'' (''Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga ins fr\u00e6kna'' 'Saga of Fridthjof the Bold') and in the [[Starkad]] section of ''[[Gautreks saga]]'' 'Gautrek's saga'.\n\nThis account cannot be reconiciled with the account in the ''Hversu'' and ''Orkneyinga saga'' without assuming multiple figures with the same names. In ''Thorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar'', Logi (a descendant of giants) is the husband to a niece of King \u00c1lf the Old of \u00c1lfheim who himself is the husband of Bergd\u00eds the daughter of King Raum (''Raumr'') of Raumar\u00edki. In the other accounts Logi is the brother of K\u00e1ri who is a distant ancestor of [[Raum the Old]] who is father of \u00c1lf or Finn\u00e1lf (''Finn\u00e1lfr''), king of \u00c1lfheim.\n\n==K\u00e1ri==\nK\u00e1ri is mentioned in one of the ''thulur'' as a term for wind. Otherwise this personage appears only in the ''Hversu'' and ''Orkneyinga saga'' accounts where K\u00e1ri appears to be the heir to his father's kingdoms as in the ''Hversu'' K\u00e1ri's descendants emerge also as rulers of ''\"K\u00e6nlandi and Finnlandi\"''. K\u00e1ri is father of a son who is named Frosti ('frost') according to the ''Orkneyinga saga'' but named J\u00f6kul (''j\u01ebkull'': 'icicle, ice, glacier') according to the ''Hversu''. This son in turn is the father of Sn\u00e6r the Old (''Sn\u00e6rr inn gamli'' 'Snow the Old').\n\nSee '''[[Sn\u00e6r]]''' to follow this lineage further.\n\n==More traditions about Frosti and Logi==\nIn the [[Ynglinga saga]] the names Logi and Frosti are otherwise connected when it relates that King [[Agne]] of [[Sweden]] in a raid on Finland killed Frosti, the leader of the Finns who opposed him and captured Skj\u00e1lf, Frosti's daughter, and her brother Logi. (But the verse of the ''Ynglingtal'' quoted here as confirmation says only that Skj\u00e1lf is Logi's kin.) Skj\u00e1lf married to Agni and avenged her father by arranging to have Agni hanged. Agni himself, as discussed under '''[[Sn\u00e6r]]''', is here a descendant of Sn\u00e6r through Sn\u00e6r's daughter Dr\u00edfa who married King [[Vanlade|Vanlandi]] of Sweden.\n\n===As an ancestor of the House of Yngling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThis is the mythic [[Yngling]] family tree based on ''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]'', ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', ''[[Beowulf]]'' and other [[Old Norse]] sources.

opens with Futaro Uesugi on his wedding day, waking from a dream about the day that he met his  bride (whose identity is obscured). The narrative then flashes back to Futaro\u2019s schooldays; in the cafeteria, he encounters Itsuki Nakano when she sits at his usually-solitary lunch table. Seeing his perfect score on a recent test paper, she asks him to help her study, and offers to share her lunch; however, he is rude to her and she becomes upset with him. Futaro receives a call from his little sister Raiha, telling him that their father has secured him a part-time job as a tutor &mdash; to, as he soon realises, Itsuki. He tries to seek her out to apologise for earlier, but ends up meeting her sisters; Ichika, Yotsuba, Miku and Nino (without realizing their identity). He goes to the Nakano apartment and tells Itsuki he is her tutor, before finding out (to his shock) that the five are identical quintuplets, all of whom he has been hired to tutor. He attempts to hold their first study session, but only Yotsuba is responsive. Nino puts sleeping pills into Futaro's water and sends him home in a taxi; Itsuki accompanies him, and meets Raiha as she greets her brother's arrival. She ends up eating dinner with the Uesugi family, discovering their financial struggles, and accepts Raiha's invitation to return.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Rooftop Confession\n| TranslitTitle   = Okuj\u014d no kokuhaku\n| NativeTitle     = \u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u544a\u767d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|17}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story02.html|title=\u7b2c\uff12\u8a71\u300c\u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u544a\u767d\u300d|trans-title=Episode 2 - \"Rooftop Confession\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 17, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story02.html|archivedate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = At their next tutoring session, Futaro (in response to how hostile the quintuplets are to the idea of having him as a tutor) challenges them to take a test, assuring them that if they pass, he will never speak to them again. They all fail, achieving only 100 between the five of them. The next day, he asks them a history question that none of them can answer &mdash; only, he notices that Miku answered that question correctly on her test. He tries to ask her about it, but they are interrupted by Yotsuba and Ichika, who embarrass Miku by talking about crushes and conclude that she is in love. Futaro meets Miku on the roof, and briefly misinterprets her admission about the earlier question as being a love confession. He discovers her interest in history (specifically Japanese warlords) and she tries catch him out with an obscure reference &mdash; even going as far as to \"disguise\" herself as Yotsuba when running from him. Futaro presents her with her favourite soda as a peace offering, and realises that each of the quintuplets got different questions correct on their tests, using this as encouragement and refusing to give up on a despondent Miku. Miku then joins Futaro and Yotsuba in the library for a study session.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = A Mountain of Problems\n| TranslitTitle   = Mondai wa yamadzumi\n| NativeTitle     = \u554f\u984c\u306f\u5c71\u7a4d\u307f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|24}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story03.html|title=\u7b2c\uff13\u8a71\u300c\u554f\u984c\u306f\u5c71\u7a4d\u307f\u300d|trans-title=Episode 3 - \"A Mountain of Problems\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 24, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story03.html|archivedate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Futaro arrives for the quintuplets' next tutoring session, but as they are about to study, Nino appears and sends away Yotsuba, Ichika and Itsuki &mdash; much to the annoyance of both Futaro and Miku. Nino challenges Miku to a cooking competition, on the condition that they will stop studying if Nino wins. Nino's dish turns out much better-looking than Miku's, but Futaro still judges the contest to be a draw, endearing him further to Miku. Futaro leaves, but quickly realises that he has left his flash cards, so he returns to the apartment, where he encounters a towel-clad Nino, who mistakes him for Miku without her contact lenses. She vents her anger at Futaro disrupting their sisterly unity, and unsettles a pile of books on a high shelf; Futaro rushes to protect her from the falling books, but is then caught in a compromising position by Itsuki. The other sisters return home and convene a court-like meeting to decide if Futaro should continue as their tutor after the incident. Miku helps Futaro protest his innocence, and after examining a photograph, so does Itsuki. Nino remains unimpressed, but leaves, upset at a comment from Ichika. She locks herself out but, too stubborn to ask the others to be let back in, ends up talking to Futaro, denying his accurate observations about her defensiveness of her sisters. She declares that she won't accept him, regardless of her sisters' protestations.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Day Off\n| TranslitTitle   = Ky\u014d wa o yasumi\n| NativeTitle     = \u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u304a\u4f11\u307f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|31}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story04.html|title=\u7b2c\uff14\u8a71\u300c\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u304a\u4f11\u307f\u300d|trans-title=Episode 4 - \"Day Off\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 31, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story04.html|archivedate=January 31, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Futaro is studying at home when Itsuki arrives to give him his tutoring pay. Futaro attempts to refuse it because he has not succeeded at making all of them study. However, his sister Raiha persuades them both to take her out for a trip to the arcade, where they have fun and take pictures in a photo-booth. As the sun starts to set, they run into the other four quintuplets, who are all wearing [[yukata]] for the upcoming festival. Yotsuba invites Raiha to come see the fireworks with them, which Futaro agrees to \u2013 provided that they all study first. Later, at the festival, Ichika flirts with Futaro but then takes a secretive phone call, while Yotsuba muses that Raiha would be her little sister if she were to marry Futaro one day. Miku explains to Futaro that watching the fireworks together is a special quintuplets tradition, as it reminds them of their mother. Nino loses her sisters in the crowd and Futaro goes out to find them before the fireworks show ends. He finds Ichika first, but is sent away by a moustached stranger. Bemused, Futaro next encounters Miku, who has injured her foot. They are mistaken for a couple by two women taking a survey, and Futaro unknowingly upsets Miku by denying that they are even friends. Spotting Itsuki, Futaro runs to catch up with her, but is quickly dragged into an alley by Ichika, where she [[kabe-don]]s him and asks him not to tell the others about their earlier encounter.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Five Fifths\n| TranslitTitle   = Zen'in de go-t\u014dbun\n| NativeTitle     = \u5168\u54e1\u3067\u4e94\u7b49\u5206\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|7}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story05.html|title=\u7b2c\uff15\u8a71\u300c\u5168\u54e1\u3067\u4e94\u7b49\u5206\u300d|trans-title=Episode 5 - \"Five Fifths\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 7, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story05.html|archivedate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the alley, Ichika explains to Futaro that she got a call from work and will not be able to watch the fireworks with her sisters this year. She sees the moustached man from earlier and embraces Futaro so as to hide behind him. Futaro again dismisses the notion that he is friends with the quintuplets, which Ichika tells him is hurtful; Futaro guiltily thinks back to Miku's earlier reaction, realising that he hurt her feelings. Meanwhile, the man searching for Ichika accosts Miku, mistaking her for her sister; Futaro stops him and declares defensively that he is the quintuplets' \"partner\". The man turns out to be Ichika's agent, calling her a \"talented young actress\", revealing her secret job. Futaro tries to persuade Ichika to not leave, but she has an important audition and insists on going. Instead, he helps her run lines, ironically reading the part of a professor to her thankful student. Ichika arrives late to her audition but wows the casting panel. When she returns, the festival is over, but Futaro brings her to the park, where her sisters are waiting for her with a mini-fireworks set. They forgive her for skipping out on their tradition. Ichika and Miku reach for the same sparkler (an implied metaphor for Futaro) but Ichika lets go, saying \"seems like you're pretty attached\", and tells Futaro she will co-operate more in study sessions.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = What's Been Built Up\n| TranslitTitle   = Tsumiageta mono\n| NativeTitle     = \u7a4d\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3082\u306e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|14}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story06.html|title=\u7b2c\uff16\u8a71\u300c\u7a4d\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3082\u306e\u300d|trans-title=Episode 6 - \"What's Been Built Up\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 13, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story06.html|archivedate=February 13, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = With midterms looming, Futaro tries to encourage Itsuki and Nino to join his tutoring sessions, but with no success (though Itsuki studies hard on her own). After skipping out on parfaits, Futaro learns through a phone call with the quintuplets father, Maruo, that he will be fired if even a single one of them fails their exam. He argues with Itsuki, with both of them declaring that they'll never work together again (something he quickly regrets). Back at the Nakano apartment, Futaro and the study group are playing [[The Game of Life]] when Nino attempts to eject him; Ichika pretends that Futaro had promised to stay overnight to ensure that he stays. While Futaro takes a bath, Nino pretends to be Itsuki and learns that he will be fired if any of them fail, much to her glee. When they return to studying, Miku asks what kind of girls Futaro likes, which he reveals in the style of a top-three countdown as each quintuplet completes a page of her studies: always cheerful, good at cooking and cares about her big brother (revealing that he was just talking about Raiha; he reiterates his lack of interest in dating). Ichika, who has been not-so-subtly setting up Futaro and Miku all evening, talks to him on the balcony, opining that he and Itsuki fight because they are so alike. Miku allows Futaro to sleep in her bed, rooming with Ichika for the night, but after getting up in the night for the bathroom, she forgets and returns to her own room. The next day, Futaro wakes to find himself next to a sleeping Miku.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Liar McLieface\n| TranslitTitle   = Usotsuki usotarou\n| NativeTitle     = \u5618\u3064\u304d\u5618\u305f\u308d\u3046\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|21}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story07.html|title=\u7b2c\uff17\u8a71\u300c\u5618\u3064\u304d\u5618\u305f\u308d\u3046\u300d|trans-title=Episode 7 - \"Liar McLieface\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 21, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story07.html|archivedate=February 21, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Over breakfast, Itsuki bemoans her difficulties in getting along with Futaro after their recent fight; Ichika playfully suggests that she disguise herself as Miku to talk to him, and Nino soon joins in. In Miku's room, Futaro wakes to find himself next to a sleeping Miku; deducing her identity from her pyjamas, he sneaks out of the room, only to find himself confronted by \"Miku\" (Itsuki in disguise). He is not fooled and quickly retreats, much to her chagrin. Futaro, Ichika and Yotsuba go to the library, where Ichika pretends to have left her pencil case at home to cover for Futaro going back to speak to Itsuki. He encounters Miku half-way and tells her that he slept on the living room floor, a lie to save them both embarrassment. Finding a sleeping Itsuki, Futaro feigns ignorance of her Miku disguise to allow her to speak more freely with him. They both apologise for their fight. Futaro stays over for another night to help the quintuplets study for their midterm exams, which they almost miss by over-sleeping. All manage to sneak in by disguising themselves as Yotsuba (who arrived on-time) using green hair ribbons. On their midterms, each quintuplet passes one subject out of five, and Futaro prepares to be fired as their tutor. However, much to everyone's surprise, Nino takes the phone and tricks their father into believing that they have all passed.

However, Futaro forgets to take his student handbook owning to the curiosity and care about Yotsuba's sudden leave, which is to decline the invitation of the school women's basketball team. To retrieve his student handbook back, Futaro goes to Nino's room, where Nino happens to see the photo of Futaro's childhood, which she says that boy is her cake unknowingly. Nino also reminds the quintuplets' childhood life and takes out the photos of their childhood.

To look after her, Futaro still misses the school unit despite Raiha's speedy recovery. So are the quintuplets, who all wish Futaro's participation. As a result, the six take their private car to the destination. However, due to the poor weather condition, they are stuck on road. Therefore, they have to stay in a hotel, where they have to sleep in the same room, which triggers the quintuplets a debate about who should sleep next to Futaro.

opens with Futaro Uesugi on his wedding day, waking from a dream about the day that he met his  bride (whose identity is obscured). The narrative then flashes back to Futaro\u2019s schooldays; in the cafeteria, he encounters Itsuki Nakano when she sits at his usually-solitary lunch table. Seeing his perfect score on a recent test paper, she asks him to help her study, and offers to share her lunch; however, he is rude to her and she becomes upset with him. Futaro receives a call from his little sister Raiha, telling him that their father has secured him a part-time job as a tutor &mdash; to, as he soon realises, Itsuki. He tries to seek her out to apologise for earlier, but ends up meeting her sisters; Ichika, Yotsuba, Miku and Nino (without realizing their identity). He goes to the Nakano apartment and tells Itsuki he is her tutor, before finding out (to his shock) that the five are identical quintuplets, all of whom he has been hired to tutor. He attempts to hold their first study session, but only Yotsuba is responsive. Nino puts sleeping pills into Futaro's water and sends him home in a taxi; Itsuki accompanies him, and meets Raiha as she greets her brother's arrival. She ends up eating dinner with the Uesugi family, discovering their financial struggles, and accepts Raiha's invitation to return.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Rooftop Confession\n| TranslitTitle   = Okuj\u014d no kokuhaku\n| NativeTitle     = \u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u544a\u767d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|17}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story02.html|title=\u7b2c\uff12\u8a71\u300c\u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u544a\u767d\u300d|trans-title=Episode 2 - \"Rooftop Confession\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 17, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story02.html|archivedate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = At their next tutoring session, Futaro (in response to how hostile the quintuplets are to the idea of having him as a tutor) challenges them to take a test, assuring them that if they pass, he will never speak to them again. They all fail, achieving only 100 between the five of them. The next day, he asks them a history question that none of them can answer &mdash; only, he notices that Miku answered that question correctly on her test. He tries to ask her about it, but they are interrupted by Yotsuba and Ichika, who embarrass Miku by talking about crushes and conclude that she is in love. Futaro meets Miku on the roof, and briefly misinterprets her admission about the earlier question as being a love confession. He discovers her interest in history (specifically Japanese warlords) and she tries catch him out with an obscure reference &mdash; even going as far as to \"disguise\" herself as Yotsuba when running from him. Futaro presents her with her favourite soda as a peace offering, and realises that each of the quintuplets got different questions correct on their tests, using this as encouragement and refusing to give up on a despondent Miku. Miku then joins Futaro and Yotsuba in the library for a study session.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = A Mountain of Problems\n| TranslitTitle   = Mondai wa yamadzumi\n| NativeTitle     = \u554f\u984c\u306f\u5c71\u7a4d\u307f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|24}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story03.html|title=\u7b2c\uff13\u8a71\u300c\u554f\u984c\u306f\u5c71\u7a4d\u307f\u300d|trans-title=Episode 3 - \"A Mountain of Problems\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 24, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story03.html|archivedate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Futaro arrives for the quintuplets' next tutoring session, but as they are about to study, Nino appears and sends away Yotsuba, Ichika and Itsuki &mdash; much to the annoyance of both Futaro and Miku. Nino challenges Miku to a cooking competition, on the condition that they will stop studying if Nino wins. Nino's dish turns out much better-looking than Miku's, but Futaro still judges the contest to be a draw, endearing him further to Miku. Futaro leaves, but quickly realises that he has left his flash cards, so he returns to the apartment, where he encounters a towel-clad Nino, who mistakes him for Miku without her contact lenses. She vents her anger at Futaro disrupting their sisterly unity, and unsettles a pile of books on a high shelf; Futaro rushes to protect her from the falling books, but is then caught in a compromising position by Itsuki. The other sisters return home and convene a court-like meeting to decide if Futaro should continue as their tutor after the incident. Miku helps Futaro protest his innocence, and after examining a photograph, so does Itsuki. Nino remains unimpressed, but leaves, upset at a comment from Ichika. She locks herself out but, too stubborn to ask the others to be let back in, ends up talking to Futaro, denying his accurate observations about her defensiveness of her sisters. She declares that she won't accept him, regardless of her sisters' protestations.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Day Off\n| TranslitTitle   = Ky\u014d wa o yasumi\n| NativeTitle     = \u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u304a\u4f11\u307f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|31}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story04.html|title=\u7b2c\uff14\u8a71\u300c\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u304a\u4f11\u307f\u300d|trans-title=Episode 4 - \"Day Off\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 31, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story04.html|archivedate=January 31, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Futaro is studying at home when Itsuki arrives to give him his tutoring pay. Futaro attempts to refuse it because he has not succeeded at making all of them study. However, his sister Raiha persuades them both to take her out for a trip to the arcade, where they have fun and take pictures in a photo-booth. As the sun starts to set, they run into the other four quintuplets, who are all wearing [[yukata]] for the upcoming festival. Yotsuba invites Raiha to come see the fireworks with them, which Futaro agrees to \u2013 provided that they all study first. Later, at the festival, Ichika flirts with Futaro but then takes a secretive phone call, while Yotsuba muses that Raiha would be her little sister if she were to marry Futaro one day. Miku explains to Futaro that watching the fireworks together is a special quintuplets tradition, as it reminds them of their mother. Nino loses her sisters in the crowd and Futaro goes out to find them before the fireworks show ends. He finds Ichika first, but is sent away by a moustached stranger. Bemused, Futaro next encounters Miku, who has injured her foot. They are mistaken for a couple by two women taking a survey, and Futaro unknowingly upsets Miku by denying that they are even friends. Spotting Itsuki, Futaro runs to catch up with her, but is quickly dragged into an alley by Ichika, where she [[kabe-don]]s him and asks him not to tell the others about their earlier encounter.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Five Fifths\n| TranslitTitle   = Zen'in de go-t\u014dbun\n| NativeTitle     = \u5168\u54e1\u3067\u4e94\u7b49\u5206\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|7}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story05.html|title=\u7b2c\uff15\u8a71\u300c\u5168\u54e1\u3067\u4e94\u7b49\u5206\u300d|trans-title=Episode 5 - \"Five Fifths\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 7, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story05.html|archivedate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the alley, Ichika explains to Futaro that she got a call from work and will not be able to watch the fireworks with her sisters this year. She sees the moustached man from earlier and embraces Futaro so as to hide behind him. Futaro again dismisses the notion that he is friends with the quintuplets, which Ichika tells him is hurtful; Futaro guiltily thinks back to Miku's earlier reaction, realising that he hurt her feelings. Meanwhile, the man searching for Ichika accosts Miku, mistaking her for her sister; Futaro stops him and declares defensively that he is the quintuplets' \"partner\". The man turns out to be Ichika's agent, calling her a \"talented young actress\", revealing her secret job. Futaro tries to persuade Ichika to not leave, but she has an important audition and insists on going. Instead, he helps her run lines, ironically reading the part of a professor to her thankful student. Ichika arrives late to her audition but wows the casting panel. When she returns, the festival is over, but Futaro brings her to the park, where her sisters are waiting for her with a mini-fireworks set. They forgive her for skipping out on their tradition. Ichika and Miku reach for the same sparkler (an implied metaphor for Futaro) but Ichika lets go, saying \"seems like you're pretty attached\", and tells Futaro she will co-operate more in study sessions.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = What's Been Built Up\n| TranslitTitle   = Tsumiageta mono\n| NativeTitle     = \u7a4d\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3082\u306e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|14}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story06.html|title=\u7b2c\uff16\u8a71\u300c\u7a4d\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3082\u306e\u300d|trans-title=Episode 6 - \"What's Been Built Up\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 13, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story06.html|archivedate=February 13, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = With midterms looming, Futaro tries to encourage Itsuki and Nino to join his tutoring sessions, but with no success (though Itsuki studies hard on her own). After skipping out on parfaits, Futaro learns through a phone call with the quintuplets father, Maruo, that he will be fired if even a single one of them fails their exam. He argues with Itsuki, with both of them declaring that they'll never work together again (something he quickly regrets). Back at the Nakano apartment, Futaro and the study group are playing [[The Game of Life]] when Nino attempts to eject him; Ichika pretends that Futaro had promised to stay overnight to ensure that he stays. While Futaro takes a bath, Nino pretends to be Itsuki and learns that he will be fired if any of them fail, much to her glee. When they return to studying, Miku asks what kind of girls Futaro likes, which he reveals in the style of a top-three countdown as each quintuplet completes a page of her studies: always cheerful, good at cooking and cares about her big brother (revealing that he was just talking about Raiha; he reiterates his lack of interest in dating). Ichika, who has been not-so-subtly setting up Futaro and Miku all evening, talks to him on the balcony, opining that he and Itsuki fight because they are so alike. Miku allows Futaro to sleep in her bed, rooming with Ichika for the night, but after getting up in the night for the bathroom, she forgets and returns to her own room. The next day, Futaro wakes to find himself next to a sleeping Miku.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Liar McLieface\n| TranslitTitle   = Usotsuki usotarou\n| NativeTitle     = \u5618\u3064\u304d\u5618\u305f\u308d\u3046\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|21}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story07.html|title=\u7b2c\uff17\u8a71\u300c\u5618\u3064\u304d\u5618\u305f\u308d\u3046\u300d|trans-title=Episode 7 - \"Liar McLieface\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 21, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/story07.html|archivedate=February 21, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Over breakfast, Itsuki bemoans her difficulties in getting along with Futaro after their recent fight; Ichika playfully suggests that she disguise herself as Miku to talk to him, and Nino soon joins in. In Miku's room, Futaro wakes to find himself next to a sleeping Miku; deducing her identity from her pyjamas, he sneaks out of the room, only to find himself confronted by \"Miku\" (Itsuki in disguise). He is not fooled and quickly retreats, much to her chagrin. Futaro, Ichika and Yotsuba go to the library, where Ichika pretends to have left her pencil case at home to cover for Futaro going back to speak to Itsuki. He encounters Miku half-way and tells her that he slept on the living room floor, a lie to save them both embarrassment. Finding a sleeping Itsuki, Futaro feigns ignorance of her Miku disguise to allow her to speak more freely with him. They both apologise for their fight. Futaro stays over for another night to help the quintuplets study for their midterm exams, which they almost miss by over-sleeping. All manage to sneak in by disguising themselves as Yotsuba (who arrived on-time) using green hair ribbons. On their midterms, each quintuplet passes one subject out of five, and Futaro prepares to be fired as their tutor. However, much to everyone's surprise, Nino takes the phone and tricks their father into believing that they have all passed.

However, Futaro forgets to take his student handbook owning to the curiosity and care about Yotsuba's sudden leave, which is to decline the invitation of the school women's basketball team. To retrieve his student handbook back, Futaro goes to Nino's room, where Nino happens to see the photo of Futaro's childhood, which she says that boy is her cake unknowingly.

The two communicates a lot, which further enhances Miku's crush to Futaro.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Quintessential Quintuplets (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Legend of Fate Day 2000\n| TranslitTitle   = Musubi no densetsu 2000-nichime\n| NativeTitle     = \u7d50\u3073\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac 2000\u65e5\u76ee\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|3|28}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"ep12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/index.html|title=\u7b2c\uff11\uff12\u8a71\u300c\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\uff12\uff10\uff10\uff10\u65e5\u76ee\u300d|trans-title=Episode 12 - \"Legend of Fate Day 2000\"|website=www.tbs.co.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 28, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020657/http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/story/index.html|archivedate=March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Futaro identifies Itsuki disguising as Ichika, so he reveals the fact on the ropeway. However, Futaro's fever falls him down to Itsuki's bosom. Before he faints, Futaro rejects Nino as the identity of Kintar\u014d. As a consequence, Nino enjoy fireworks alone. Meanwhile, Ichika and Miku confess their feelings about Futaro to each other. Yotsuba and Itsuki blame themselves for Futaro's illness. Later, Itsuki sneaks into the ward to look after him. Much to her surprise, the remaining four come to the ward as well. In this way, the six spends their time enjoying the fireworks festival. Several years later, it is the wedding ceremony. However, Futaro forgets the wedding ring. His sister Raiha sends the ring to him and finds that Futaro still carries the amulet she sent when she was in childhood. It turns out that Futaro engages with one of the quintuplets.\n| LineColor       = ffa6ff\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|anime and manga}}\n* {{Official site|http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/5hanayome/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|anime|21514|The Quintessential Quintuplets}}\n\n{{The Quintessential Quintuplets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quintessential Quintuplets, The}}\n[[Category:2019 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quintessential_Quintuplets_(season_1)"}
