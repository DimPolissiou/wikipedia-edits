{"title_page": "List of attacks related to secondary schools", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of attacks related to secondary schools''' that have occurred around the world. These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

The child turned out to be a girl, [[Ciri (character)|Cirilla]], commonly known as Ciri; since then the two are linked to each other. At first, Geralt did not take her because women cannot become witchers. However, fate caused Geralt and Ciri to cross their paths thrice, with him claiming her for a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter; and after the death of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of Cintra, Geralt ends up taking the girl into his care, training and loving her as his own daughter. \n\nFollowing the short stories, the novels unfold as Geralt is pulled into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect Ciri from those who would do her harm, becoming reluctantly embroiled in the political contentions of monarchs and emperors.\n\n==Literary analysis and reception ==\nGeralt is described as being emblematic of Polish popular culture's spirit of \"[[neo-liberal]] anti-politics\" in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Apor2008\">{{cite book|last=Apor|first=P\u00e9ter|title=Past for the eyes: East European representations of communism in cinema and museums after 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO8LAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639776050|page=198}}</ref> He is a professional, carrying out his duties and unwilling to become involved in the \"petty quarrels\" of the contemporary politics.<ref name=\"Apor2008\"/> [[Marek Oramus]] compared Geralt to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Oramus |first=Marek |author-link=Marek Oramus |date=2 September 2000 |title=Only the right image of a witcher |trans-title=Jedynie s\u0142uszny wizerunek wied\u017amina |url=https://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html |language=Polish |work=[[Polityka]] |location=[[Poland]] |access-date=30 May 2011 |pages=52\u201354}}</ref> In 2018, [[GamesRadar]] ranked him as the 6th best hero in video game history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/heroes-in-video-games/3/ |title=The best heroes in video games |last= |first= |date=28 February 2018 |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |access-date=31 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref> In 2018, Geralt was included in [[Tom's Guide]] Top 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1544-best-video-game-characters-of-all-time.html|title=The 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time|last=July 2018|first=Tom's Guide Staff 07|website=Tom's Guide|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n=== Film ===\n[[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]] portrays Geralt in the Polish-language adaptation movie ''[[The Hexer (film)|The Hexer]]''.\n\n===Television===\n* [[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]] portrays Geralt in the polish adaptation series ''[[The Hexer (TV series)|The Hexer]]''.\n* [[Henry Cavill]] portrays Geralt in the [[Netflix]] [[The Witcher (TV series)|adaptation of the books]], the first season of which was released in 2019.<ref name=\"directors\">{{cite web | url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-pivotal-roles-of-ciri-yennefer | title=Netflix\u2019S The Witcher casts pivotal roles of Ciri & Yennefer | date=10 October 2018 | publisher=Netflix | accessdate=16 January 2019 }}</ref> Sapkowski served as a creative consultant on the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/witcher-saga-tv-series-adaptation-ordered-at-netflix-1004558|title='The Witcher' Saga TV Series Adaptation Ordered at Netflix|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Geralt of Rivia.png|thumb|Geralt as he appears in ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' (2015)]] -->[[File:W3 SS Geralt.png|thumb|208x208px|Geralt in ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'']]\nGeralt's adventures continues in a non-canonical version by CD Projekt Red's video game trilogy (''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'', ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]''), where he is still alive after being killed by a mob during an anti non-human riot at the end of the Witcher novel saga and his body was taken in a boat by his daughter Ciri to [[Avalon]].\n\nSapkowski stated that the games are a work of art of their own and that they cannot be considered either an \"alternative version\", or a sequel, \"because this can only be told by Geralt's creator.

Officers from the NCA travelled to Malaysia to engage local charities, who performed child protection workshops in the community where Huckle lived, but they were kept in the dark about the gravity of his crimes.

For the same reason, severe media restrictions were put in place, which prevented anybody from reporting the story until the British Government had taken steps to ensure that all of Huckle's material had been taken down and that steps had been taken to protect his victims from other predators.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK paedophile admits string of sex attacks on Malaysian children|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/uk-paedophile-admits-string-of-sex-attacks-on-malaysian-children/news-story/85d11fecb09522879f41f15c210875b2|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|date=2 June 2016}}</ref> On 6 June 2016, however, the National Crime Agency referred itself to the police watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]], due to the fact that they were aware of Huckle's continued attendance at two churches in the UK up until the time of his re-arrest in January 2015 but did not contact them until sentencing had already begun.
