Gill was soon joined by Benny Johnson (a [[John Pople|Pople]] graduate student) and Carlos Gonzalez (another [[John Pople|Pople]] postdoc), but the latter left the company shortly thereafter. In mid-1993, [[Martin Head-Gordon]], formerly a [[John Pople|Pople]] student, but at that time on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] tenure track, joined the growing team of academic developers.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\n[[File:Q-Chem Postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard advertising the release of Q-Chem 1.0.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Citations-to-qchem-papers.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2.

The first commercial product, Q-Chem 1.0, was released in March 1997. Advertising postcards celebrated the release with the proud headline, \"Problems which were once impossible are now routine\"; however, version 1.0 had many shortcomings, and a wit once remarked that the words \"impossible\" and \"routine\" should probably be interchanged!<ref name='qc.engine' /> However, vigorous code development continued, and by the following year Q-Chem 1.1 was able to offer most of the basic [[Quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] functionality as well as a growing list of features (the continuous fast multipole method, J-matrix engine, COLD PRISM for integrals, and G96 [[density functional theory|density functional]], for example) that were not available in any other package.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nFollowing a setback when Johnson left, the company became more decentralized, establishing and cultivating relationships with an ever-increasing circle of research groups in universities around the world. In 1998, [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Fritz Schaefer]] accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors and, early in 1999, as soon as his non-compete agreement with [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]] had expired, [[John Pople]] joined as both a Director and code developer.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nIn 2000, Q-Chem established a collaboration with Wavefunction Inc., which led to the incorporation of Q-Chem as the [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] engine in all subsequent versions of the Spartan package. The Q-Chem Board was expanded in March 2003 with the addition of [[Anna Krylov]] and Jing Kong.  In 2012, John Herbert joined the Board and [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Fritz Schaefer]] became a Member Emeritus.  In 2018, Evgeny Epifanovsky was named Chief Operations Officer.  The following year, Shirin Faraji joined the Board; Peter Gill, who had been President of Q-Chem since 1988, stepped down; and [[Anna Krylov]] became the new president. The active Board of Directors currently consists of Faraji, Gill (past-President), Herbert, [[Anna Krylov|Krylov]] (President), and Hilary Pople ([[John Pople|John's]] daughter). [[Martin Head-Gordon]] remains a Scientific Advisor to the Board.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nCurrently, there are thousands of Q-Chem licenses in use, and Q-Chem's user base is expanding, as illustrated by citation records for releases 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, which reached 400 per year in 2016 (see Figure 2).<ref name='qc.engine' /> [[File:Citations.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2.

This transition, from in-house code to major electronic structure engine, has become possible due to contributions from numerous scientific collaborators; the Q-Chem business model encourages broad developer participation.  Q-Chem defines its genre as open-teamware:<ref name=\"qc.engine\" /> its source code is open to a large group of developers. In addition, some Q-Chem modules are distributed as open source.<ref name=\"qc.engine\" />  Since 1992, over 400 man- (and woman-) years have been devoted to code development. Q-Chem 5.2.2, released in December 2019, consists of 7.5 million lines of code, which includes contributions by more than 300 active developers (current estimate is 312).<ref name=\"qc.url\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.q-chem.com/|title=Quantum Computational Software; Molecular Modeling; Visualization|website=www.q-chem.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"qc.engine\" /> See Figure 3.\n\n==Features==\nQ-Chem can perform a number of general quantum chemistry calculations, such as [[Hartree\u2013Fock method|Hartree\u2013Fock]], [[density functional theory]] (DFT) including time-dependent DFT ([[Time-dependent density functional theory|TDDFT]]), [[M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory]] (MP2), [[coupled cluster]] (CC), equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC),<ref name='eom-krylov' /><ref name='eom-sneskov' /><ref name='eom-bartlett' /> [[configuration interaction]] (CI), algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), and other advanced electronic structure methods. Q-Chem also includes [[QM/MM]] functionality. Q-Chem 4.0 and higher releases come with the graphical user interface, [http://www.iqmol.org IQMol], which includes a hierarchical input generator, a molecular builder, and general visualization capabilities (MOs, densities, molecular vibrations, reaction pathways, etc.). IQMol is developed by Andrew Gilbert (in coordination with Q-Chem) and is distributed as free open-source software.  IQmol is written using the Qt libraries, enabling it to run on a range of platforms, including OS X, Widows, and Linux. It provides an intuitive environment to set up, run, and analyze Q-Chem calculations. It can also read and display a variety of file formats, including the widely available formatted checkpoint format. A complete, up-to-date list of features is published on the Q-Chem website and in the user manual.<ref name=\"qc.url\" />\n\nIn addition, Q-Chem is interfaced with WebMO and is used as the computing engine in [[Spartan (chemistry software)|Spartan]], or as a back-end to [[CHARMM]], [[GROMACS]], and ChemShell.

Gill was soon joined by Benny Johnson (a [[John Pople|Pople]] graduate student) and Carlos Gonzalez (another [[John Pople|Pople]] postdoc), but the latter left the company shortly thereafter. In mid-1993, [[Martin Head-Gordon]], formerly a [[John Pople|Pople]] student, but at that time on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] tenure track, joined the growing team of academic developers.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\n[[File:Q-Chem Postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard advertising the release of Q-Chem 1.0.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Citations-to-qchem-papers.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2.

The first commercial product, Q-Chem 1.0, was released in March 1997. Advertising postcards celebrated the release with the proud headline, \"Problems which were once impossible are now routine\"; however, version 1.0 had many shortcomings, and a wit once remarked that the words \"impossible\" and \"routine\" should probably be interchanged!<ref name='qc.engine' /> However, vigorous code development continued, and by the following year Q-Chem 1.1 was able to offer most of the basic [[Quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] functionality as well as a growing list of features (the continuous fast multipole method, J-matrix engine, COLD PRISM for integrals, and G96 [[density functional theory|density functional]], for example) that were not available in any other package.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nFollowing a setback when Johnson left, the company became more decentralized, establishing and cultivating relationships with an ever-increasing circle of research groups in universities around the world. In 1998, [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Fritz Schaefer]] accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors and, early in 1999, as soon as his non-compete agreement with [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]] had expired, [[John Pople]] joined as both a Director and code developer.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nIn 2000, Q-Chem established a collaboration with Wavefunction Inc., which led to the incorporation of Q-Chem as the [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] engine in all subsequent versions of the Spartan package. The Q-Chem Board was expanded in March 2003 with the addition of [[Anna Krylov]] and Jing Kong.  In 2012, John Herbert joined the Board and [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Fritz Schaefer]] became a Member Emeritus.  In 2018, Evgeny Epifanovsky was named Chief Operations Officer.  The following year, Shirin Faraji joined the Board; Peter Gill, who had been President of Q-Chem since 1988, stepped down; and [[Anna Krylov]] became the new President. The active Board of Directors currently consists of Faraji, Gill (past-President), Herbert, [[Anna Krylov|Krylov]] (President), and Hilary Pople ([[John Pople|John's]] daughter). [[Martin Head-Gordon]] remains a Scientific Advisor to the Board.<ref name='qc.url' /><ref name='qc.engine' />\n\nCurrently, there are thousands of Q-Chem licenses in use, and Q-Chem's user base is expanding, as illustrated by citation records for releases 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, which reached 400 per year in 2016 (see Figure 2).<ref name='qc.engine' /> [[File:Citations.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2.

This transition, from in-house code to major electronic structure engine, has become possible due to contributions from numerous scientific collaborators; the Q-Chem business model encourages broad developer participation.  Q-Chem defines its genre as open-teamware<ref name=\"qc.engine\" />: its source code is open to a large group of developers. In addition, some Q-Chem modules are distributed as open source.<ref name=\"qc.engine\" />  Since 1992, over 400 man- (and woman-) years have been devoted to code development. Q-Chem 5.2.2, released in December 2019, consists of 7.5 million lines of code, which includes contributions by more than 300 active developers (current estimate is 312).<ref name=\"qc.url\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.q-chem.com/|title=Quantum Computational Software; Molecular Modeling; Visualization|website=www.q-chem.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"qc.engine\" /> See Figure 3.\n\n==Features==\nQ-Chem can perform a number of general quantum chemistry calculations, such as [[Hartree\u2013Fock method|Hartree\u2013Fock]], [[density functional theory]] (DFT) including time-dependent DFT ([[Time-dependent density functional theory|TDDFT]]), [[M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory]] (MP2), [[coupled cluster]] (CC), equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC),<ref name='eom-krylov' /><ref name='eom-sneskov' /><ref name='eom-bartlett' /> [[configuration interaction]] (CI), algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), and other advanced electronic structure methods. Q-Chem also includes [[QM/MM]] functionality. Q-Chem 4.0 and higher releases come with the graphical user interface, [http://www.iqmol.org IQMol], which includes a hierarchical input generator, a molecular builder, and general visualization capabilities (MOs, densities, molecular vibrations, reaction pathways, etc.). IQMol is developed by Andrew Gilbert (in coordination with Q-Chem) and is distributed as free open-source software.  IQmol is written using the Qt libraries, enabling it to run on a range of platforms, including OS X, Widows, and Linux. It provides an intuitive environment to set up, run, and analyze Q-Chem calculations. It can also read and display a variety of file formats, including the widely available formatted checkpoint format. A complete, up-to-date list of features is published on the Q-Chem website and in the user manual.<ref name=\"qc.url\" />\n\nIn addition, Q-Chem is interfaced with WebMO and is used as the computing engine in [[Spartan (chemistry software)|Spartan]], or as a back-end to [[CHARMM]], [[GROMACS]], and ChemShell. Other popular visualization programs such as [[Jmol]] and [[Molden]] can also be used.\n\nIn 2018, Q-Chem established a partnership with [https://www.brianqc.com BrianQC], produced by [http://www.streamnovation.com StreamNovation, Ltd.], a new integral engine exploiting the computational power of GPUs.

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as [[Vedism]], [[Orthodoxy]], and [[Old Believers|Old Belief]].\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|Slavic paganism}}\n[[File:Russian Rodnover women.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover women with child.]]\n\n[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Szczodre Gody MIR 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar.]]\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A.

Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood\u2014at least in part\u2014as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}\n\n===Slavic folk religion and double belief===\n[[File:\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b \u00ab\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u00bb .jpg|thumb|''The Fiery Chariot of the Word''\u201419th-century [[Russian icon]] of the ''[[Theotokos]]'' as [[Ognyena Maria]] (\"Fiery Mary\"), fire goddess sister of [[Perun]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Rou\u010dek |editor-first=Joseph Slabey |title=Ognyena Maria |encyclopedia=Slavonic Encyclopedia |year=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York}} p. 905</ref> Belief in a [[mother goddess]] as the receptacle of life, [[Mat Syra Zemlya]] (\"Damp Mother Earth\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=15, 16}} The fiery \"six-petaled roses\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}}]]\n\nA different perspective is offered by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by [[Romanticism]] and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia;{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=132\u2013133}} according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition.<ref>''vide'' {{cite magazine |last=Sadowski |first=Marcin |date=2015 |title=Polityka jedno\u015bci w rodzimowierstwie polskim |trans-title=Politics of unity in Polish Rodnovery |magazine=Gniazdo.

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J.

The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God\u2014generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' (\"Judge\") and ''Prabog'' (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}\n\nThe root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities.

Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is \"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing \"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\".{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=65\u201366}} Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for [[individual and group rights|collective rights than individual rights]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\n\n\nSlavic Native Faith's world-view is often [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] in basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}}\n\nMany Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=235}} Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=229}} and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} Some Rodnovers promote [[racial segregation]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|p=98}} and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of [[social injustice]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} an approach that could require [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=234|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284}} for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nMany Rodnovers oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]] and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind;

Glory to Dazhboh!\"{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=3}} Simpson noted that in Poland, several Rodnovers launched a poster campaign against [[Valentines Day]], which they regarded as not being an authentically Polish celebration.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=120}} In Russia, Rodnovers have vandalised and torched various churches.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=70}}\n\nChristians have also been responsible for opposition to Slavic Native Faith, for instance through the establishment of social media groups against the movement.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=325}} The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has expressed opposition to the growth and spread of Slavic Native Faith across Russia on various occasions.{{Sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} Some Russian Rodnovers have however attempted to improve relations with the Orthodox Church, arguing that Russian Orthodoxy had adopted many elements of historical Slavic belief and rites.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1pp=198\u2013199|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=290}} In this way they argue that Russian Orthodoxy is distinct from other forms of Christianity,{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} and seek to portray it as the \"younger brother\" of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|p=199}} The Orthodox Christian [[Old Believers]], a movement that split out from the Russian Orthodox Church during the reform of [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] in the seventeenth century, is seen by Rodnovers in a more positive light than the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church, as Old Believers are considered to have elements similar to those of the Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=61}}\n\n==Organisation, rites and practices==\n[[File:Kupala 2017 in Krasotinka, Kaluga (4).jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover priest drawing a dot on the forehead of believers for the celebrations of [[Kupala Night]] festival.]]\n\nRodnovery is essentially a religion of the community, with most adherents actively joining organisations; only a minority of believers choose solitary practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=118|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=63}} Sometimes, Slavic Native Faith groups send guests to the religious meetings of other groups, including those in other countries.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=79}} Most Slavic Native Faith groups strongly emphasise the commemoration of ancestors in their religious practices.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given to creating what they perceive as \"genuine\" Slavic rituals rather than those which will be psychologically empowering.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}}\n\nThere is much variation in the patterns of organisation and practice between different groups, and depending on the level such groups intend to represent, whether national or local. For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of ''[[sobornost]]'' formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=191}} ''Veche'' is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international \"Veche of Slavic Native Faith\", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves\u2014that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses. The Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova is one of such centres, located in the Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slavkreml.ru/ |title=\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c \u0412\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0421\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 |website=slavkreml.ru |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref> Some Rodnover networks have established thorough villages all over Russia; this is the case, among other examples, of those Rodnovers who are part of the [[Ringing Cedars]]' movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}}\n\nRituals and religious meetings are often performed in rural settings, such as clearings in woodland.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The basic structure of a [[temple]] of the Slavic Native Faith (\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0449\u0435, ''kapishche''; or \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c, ''khram'') is constituted by a sacred precinct at the centre of which are placed poles with carved images of the gods enshrined.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}\n\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev;

He says that Meryan Native Faith is mostly Slavic Native Faith whose concepts, names and iconoraphy are [[Finnicised]]. Meryan Rodnovers also rely upon the uninterrupted traditions of [[Mari Native Faith]]; on 27 September 2015, they organised a joint Mari-Merya prayer in the Moscow region.

There are at least four such churches: the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the fellowship established by Volodymyr Chornyi centred in [[Lviv]], and the more independent Union of the Native Ukrainian Faith.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|pp=17\u201318}} According to the definition of Sylenko himself, his doctrine is that of a solar \"absolute monotheism\", in which the single God is Dazhbog,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} that is to say the sky, the Sun, and the self-giving of the world itself.\n\nSylenko proclaimed himself a prophet, bringing to the Slavs a new understanding of God that, according to him, corresponds to their own and original understanding of God. By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \"breath of his ancestors\" being united with them \"by divine holiness\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \"false prophet\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\", the \"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=22}}\n\n====Yagnovery, Ladovery, and Orantism====\nYagnovery (Ukrainian: \u042f\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430), Ladovery (\u041b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430) and Orantism (\u041e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=238}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kutuzova |first=N.

They hold that the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' of the [[Edda]] (itself composed by [[Snorri Sturluson]] on the basis of an older ''[[Ynglingatal]]''), proves their ideas about the origins of the Ynglings in Omsk and is ultimately a more recent version of texts contained in their own sacred books, the ''Slavo-Aryan Vedas''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe spiritual academy of the Ynglist Church teaches their Vedas, \"Aryan mathematics\" and grammar, and health techniques.

The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\",{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|pp=450\u2013451}}\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n====Tezaurus' Authentism====\n{{Main|Authentism}}\n\nAuthentism (Russian: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c), incorporated as the \"Tezaurus Spiritual Union\" (\u0414\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \"\u0422\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0441\"), is a Rodnover spiritual philosophy and psychological order created by the psychologist Sergey Petrovich Semenov in 1984, in Saint Petersburg.

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as [[Vedism]], [[Orthodoxy]], and [[Old Believers|Old Belief]].\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by [[Romanticism]] and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia;{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=132\u2013133}} according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition.<ref>''vide'' {{cite magazine |last=Sadowski |first=Marcin |date=2015 |title=Polityka jedno\u015bci w rodzimowierstwie polskim |trans-title=Politics of unity in Polish Rodnovery |magazine=Gniazdo.

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J. Ivanits reports ethnographic studies documenting that even in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia there were entire villages maintaining indigenous religious beliefs, whether in pure form or under the cover of a superficial Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=4}} According to her, the case of Russia is exceptional compared to western Europe, because Russia neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the [[Renaissance]], nor the [[Reformation]], nor the other movements which severely weakened folk spirituality in Europe.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=3}}\n\n===Symbolism===\n:''{{Commonscat-inline|Rodnover symbols}}''\n[[File:Rodnover symbols.png|thumb|From left to right: [[Swastika#Slavic|Kolovrat]], Hands of Svarog, Thundermark, symbol of [[Veles (god)|Veles]].]]\n\nThe most commonly used religious symbol within Rodnovery is the ''kolovrat'' (\"spinning wheel\"), a variant of the ''[[swastika]]'' (Sanskrit: \"wellbeing\", \"wellness\").{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=282}} As such, it represents wholeness, the ultimate source of renewal, the cosmic order and the four directions.{{sfn|Leeming|2005|p=369: ''Svastika''}} According to the studies of [[Boris Rybakov]], whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the \"six-petalled rose inside a circle\" (e.g. [[File:RozetaSolarSymbol.svg|30px]]) and the \"thunder mark\" (''gromovoi znak''), represent the supreme God (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), expressing itself as power of birth and reproduction, in its various forms (whether Triglav, Svetovid, Perun and other gods) and were still carved in folk traditions of north Russia up to the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=14, 17}} The contemporary design of the symbol called ''kolovrat'', the eight-spoked wheel, used by Rodnovers was already present in [[woodcut]]s produced in the 1920s by the Polish artist Stanis\u0142aw Jakubowski, under the name ''s\u0142oneczko'' (\"little sun\").<ref>{{cite book |author=Stanis\u0142aw Jakubowski |title=Pras\u0142owia\u0144skie motywy architektoniczne |year=1923 |publisher=Orbis |location=D\u0119bniki, Krak\u00f3w}} [http://www.slowianie.republika.pl/drzeworyty.htm Illustrations of Jakubowski's artworks].</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\n===\"Rodnovery\" (Native Faith)===\n[[File:Svetoary community celebrating Mokosh 2016.jpg|thumb|The Svetoary community of the [[Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities]] celebrating Mokosh.]]\n\nThe majority of practitioners of modern Slavic Paganism call their religion \"Native Faith\".{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=27}} This term appears in slightly different forms depending on the Slavic language in question: in Ukrainian, it is ''Ridnovirstvo'' or ''Ridnovirya'', in Russian ''Rodnoverie'', in Polish ''Rodzimowierstwo'', and in Czech ''Rodnov\u0115\u0159\u00ed''.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=27}} The term derives from the [[Proto-Slavic]] roots *''rod'' (\u0440\u043e\u0434), which means anything \"indigenous\", \"ancestral\" and \"native\", also \"genus\", \"generation\", \"kin\", \"race\" (cf.

The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God\u2014generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' (\"Judge\") and ''Prabog'' (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}\n\nThe root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is called upon as the god of literature and communication.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}}\n\nIn Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} Conversely, Sylenko's [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] (RUNVira; also called \"Sylenkoism\") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=225|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=90|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=130}} For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}}\n\nSylenko characterised Dazhbog as \"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] rather than monotheistic.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=91}} A similar view is adopted by Russian [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}\n\n===Morality and ethics===\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping Perun in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine.png|thumb|upright|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a ''kapy'' (pole) of [[Perun]], in [[Ternopil Oblast]], Ukraine.]]\n\nRodnovery emphasises the \"this-worldliness\" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit\u2013matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \"suppress knowledge\" carried forward either by Soviet-style [[scientism]] or by \"Judaic cosmopolitan\" forces.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include ''The Songs of the Bird Gamayon'', ''Koliada's Book of Stars'', ''The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave'' or ''The Rigveda of Kiev''.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=291}} Some Rodnovers pejoratively dismiss movements such as that of the ''Vseyasvetnaya gramota'' as \"[[New Age]]\" and claim that reliance on them discredits the Slavic Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=159}}\n\n[[File:Ukraine, outdoor Sylenkoite worship (0).png|thumb|left|Worship ceremony led by the priests of the General Fire of Slavic Native Faith.]]\n\nSome Rodnovers believe that Slavs constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of an ancient Aryan race, whom they equate with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} Some Rodnovers believe that the Aryans originated at the [[North Pole]] but moved south as a result of declining temperatures,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=187|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=292}} while others claim that the Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=103}}\n\nSome Rodnovers regard Slavic countries as having a messianic role in humanity's future, for instance with the belief that Ukraine will be the world's future geopolitical centre,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}} or that Russia will be the home of a post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} Such racially eschatological beliefs are explicitly rejected by other Rodnovers, like the Circle of Pagan Tradition.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\nAlthough their understanding of the past is typically rooted in spiritual conviction rather than in arguments that would be acceptable within academia, many Rodnovers seek to promote their beliefs about the past among academics.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=155}} For instance, in 2002 Serbian Rodnovers established Svevlad, a research group devoted to historical Slavic religion which simulated academic discourse but was \"highly selective, unsystematic, and distorted\" in its examination of the evidence.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=60\u201361}} In several Slavic countries, many archaeologists and historians have been hesitant about giving credence to Rodnover interpretations of the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=120|2a1=Aitamurto|2a2=Gaidukov|2y=2013|2p=155}} In turn, practitioners have accused academics of being part of a conspiracy to conceal the truth about the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=292|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===Views on Christianity===\n{{main|Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies}}\n[[File:Initiation of a woman into the Native Faith (Rodnovery), near Moscow.jpg|thumb|The initiation of a woman into Rodnovery, in [[Moscow]], Russia.]]\n\nMany Rodnovers actively reject Christianity or adopt anti-Christian views.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=223|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=7|3a1=Simpson|3y=2013|3p=121}} Practitioners generally regard [[Abrahamic religions]] as a destructive force that erodes what they view as organic peoples,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|pp=43\u201344}} with Christianity being perceived as a foreign force that is destroying Slavic culture.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=131}} Some Rodnovers also take a hostile stance toward [[Judaism]], which they regard as having spawned Christianity,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} or believe that Christianity has left Russia under the control of Jews.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} Rodnovers often reject Christian ideas of humility, regarding them as antithetical to a Rodnover emphasis on courage and fighting spirit.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} Christianity is considered as a system that destroys morality by casting human responsibility away from the present world and into a transcendent future,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} and it is also criticised as being anthropocentric, and thus responsible for ecological disruption.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} In Russia, Rodnovers often criticise Christianity for its claim to have a monopoly on truth;

For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history.

Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}\n\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \"breath of his ancestors\" being united with them \"by divine holiness\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \"false prophet\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\", the \"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=22}}\n\n====Yagnovery, Ladovery, and Orantism====\nYagnovery (Ukrainian: \u042f\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430), Ladovery (\u041b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430) and Orantism (\u041e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=238}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kutuzova |first=N.

They believe that \"[[Yngling]]\", a name that identifies the earliest royal dynasties of [[Scandinavia]], means \"offspring of Yngly\", and that the historical Ynglings migrated to Scandinavia from the region of Omsk, which was a spiritual centre of the early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].

The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\",{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|pp=450\u2013451}}\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n====Tezaurus' Authentism====\n{{Main|Authentism}}\n\nAuthentism (Russian: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c), incorporated as the \"Tezaurus Spiritual Union\" (\u0414\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \"\u0422\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0441\"), is a Rodnover spiritual philosophy and psychological order created by the psychologist Sergey Petrovich Semenov in 1984, in Saint Petersburg.

It means explosive.\n\n== Plot ==\nNasir Jamal (Aditya Rawal), a teenager boy, resident of Kareli area in Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh). His friends call him 'Naate' despite him being quite tall.  Naate brings home complaints regularly. His father Shahid Jamal, a reputed contractor overlooks his son's deeds and in turn encourages his behaviour for the worse while his mom worried sick about her son and his carelessness. \n\nOne evening, Nasir goes to drop off a parcel at Sanam CD Music shop on Zahid's request, Naate's childhood friend. There, he finds the shop closed and coincidently meets a young girl, Neelam ([[Shalini Pandey]]) who lives right above the shop. An interesting conversation takes place between them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and Naate is now drawn to her. its not very different for Neelam. She appreciates Nasir's genuine gestures towards her, however she seems hesitant when things start to get real. Having had a tough journey, she battles to make things work with Nasir, but he is too light hearted about it all to see any red flags. \n\nWhile Nasir and Neelam get closer, Jigar Fareedi ([[Vijay Varma]]), a seemingly charming, influential person and a role model for many youngsters alike across paths with Nasir on account of his fight with Rajeeb Mehndi, a college student politician who is Jigar's candidate. Jigar demands that Nasir make a public apology and is arrogantly turned down leading to the beginning of an ego conflict between the two. \n\nNeelam struggles to understand her relationship with Nasir, but is unaware of how much she has grown to like him. They face multiple obstacle and are presented with testing times to really explore their journey together and what it would have mean for them to stay together anywhere. \n\nThis leads us to find out whether Nasir and Neelam will ever be able to be together?\n   \n== Production ==\n\n\n'''Scripting'''\n\nDirector Ranjan met his co-writer Hanzalah Shahid after coming back from the shoot of the film \u2018[[Mukkabaaz]]\u2019.

Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face?

The striking introduction melds realism, humour and an earthy song. She mentioned, \"The second half of ''Bamfaad'' does not live up to the promise of the pre-interval portion.

For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\".

There were too many airlines in Anchorage at the time, and not enough demand to support them. In the next few years the airline performed many mergers and acquisitions that produced changes in the name and saw business expand throughout Alaska. The first of these mergers was in 1934, when McGee sold his namesake airline for US$50,000 to [[Star Air Service]], an airline also located in Anchorage. This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\">{{cite news|last=Glab |first=Jim |title=Alaska Airlines 75th Anniversary |url=http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503104421/http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |work=[[Air Transport World]] |archivedate=May 3, 2012 |access-date=May 17, 2012 |date=December 1, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> With a fleet of fifteen aircraft, Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska.

That year, Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as '''Star Air Lines'''.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/> Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1938, federal regulation began when Congress created the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II.

It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In 1986 Alaska Air Group acquired regional airline [[Horizon Air]], which remained a separate brand from Alaska Airlines; since then, both airlines have been subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group. In 1987, Alaska Airlines purchased [[Jet America Airlines]].<ref name=HistoricalOverviewAlaska>{{cite web |url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/overview.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505164024/http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/overview.aspx |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |access-date=May 17, 2012 |title=Historical Overview |work=Alaska Airlines |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjY4fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1 |title=Alaska Air Group: 2008 Annual Report |work=corporate-ir.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105045952/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjY4fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1 |archivedate=January 5, 2019 |access-date=June 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alaska initially operated Jet America as a separate airline, but this proved economically unviable and Jet America's operations were merged into Alaska's.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter. An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> This concept, known as \"Airport of the Future\" by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines as well.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /> The airline would also become the first airline in the world to integrate [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[Ground proximity warning system|Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System]] (EGPWS) technology, adding a real-time, three-dimensional display of terrain. The system was operational in all the carrier's Boeing 737-400s by April 1999.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the carrier recording much profitability. The airline added new training and maintenance facilities.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Also, the airline began buying new 737s, ordering three [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-700|Boeing 737-700s]] and becoming the launch customer for the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] when it placed an order for ten of the jets in November 1997.<ref name=\"Launch customer for B737-900\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|title=Alaska Airlines Order Launches Boeing 737-900 Program|date=November 10, 1997|publisher=[[Boeing]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106182308/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|archivedate=November 6, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=July 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"737Order-1997_ST\">{{cite news|last=Lane |first=Polly |title=Boeing Gets $2 Billion In New Orders For Jets |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |access-date=July 4, 2012 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 10, 1997 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517022655/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Introducing flights across the U.S. (2000s)===\n[[File:B737-900 Alaska Seatac.JPG|thumb|left|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport.

In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] and rising costs for maintenance, fuel and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out the remaining 26 MD-80s and trained the pilots to fly the newer 737-800s that were being ordered to replace them. The last MD-80 flights took place on August 25, 2008.<ref name=\"md80 retired\" />\n\nAlaska also used eight [[Boeing 737#737-200|Boeing 737-200 Combi/QCs]] to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska. These [[combi aircraft]] operated with mixed load of passengers and freight on the main deck were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured (hence the moniker QC or \"Quick Change\") to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight. In the all-freight configuration, the 737-200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers, known as \"igloos.\" The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats. The 737-200s were also gravel-kitted, which allowed them to be used at airports such as [[Red Dog Airport|Red Dog]], which formerly featured a gravel runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/news/feature/737qc.html |title=The Airplane That Never Sleeps |publisher=Boeing |date=July 15, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009170942/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/news/feature/737qc.html |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |access-date=August 18, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Alaska replaced the 737-200s with six reconfigured 737-400s between 2006 and 2007.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased [[Douglas DC-3]]s, [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]]s.<ref name=history_link /> Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nAlaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to [[Paine Field]], an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

Most include the [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] (HF) and some [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock]] methods. They may also include [[density functional theory]] (DFT), [[molecular mechanics]] or [[semi-empirical quantum chemistry method]]s. The programs include both [[Open-source software|open source]] and commercial software. Most of them are large, often containing several separate programs, and have been developed over many years.\n\nThe following table illustrates some of their main capabilities.\n\n{| class=\"sortable
