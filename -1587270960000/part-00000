It stands in front of the old country courthouse in the town of [[Kapaau, Hawaii|Kapa\u02bbau]], located in [[North Kohala]] on the [[Island of Hawai\u02bbi]]. Made of cast [[brass]] and painted with lifelike colors, it depicts [[Kamehameha I]], and represents an important cultural and spiritual object for the local community.\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Kamehameha I'' sculpture is an oversized painted brass casting of King Kamehameha I, the ruler credited with unifying the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in the early nineteenth century and establishing the [[Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1810. Though the surface of the sculpture was originally finished with a brown chemical [[patina]] and [[gold leaf]], it has become local tradition to paint the statue with lifelike colors, and it appears as such to this day. Originally commissioned to celebrate the [[centennial]] of [[Captain Cook]]\u2019s arrival to the Hawaiian Islands and to stand in front of the [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]] government building in [[Honolulu]], extenuating circumstances during its delivery to Hawai{{okina}}i delayed its arrival, and resulted in its being placed instead in Kapa{{okina}}au, near Kamehameha I's birthplace.\n\n==Historical information==\n\n===Commission and delivery to Hawai{{okina}}i===\nThe statue had its origins in 1878 when [[Walter M. Gibson]], a member of the Hawaiian legislature at the time, decided to commission a sculpture to commemorate the 100 year arrival of [[Captain Cook]] to the Hawaiian Islands. The legislature appropriated $10,000 for the project and made Gibson chairman of the Commemorative Monument Committee formed to oversee the process. While the committee did include Native Hawaiians, it was strongly directed by Gibson and by King David [[Kal\u0101kaua]].<ref>McConnel. 1898. ''The Great Kamehameha''. The Paradise of the Pacific 9 (9): 131 \u2013 132, 137.</ref>  After searching several prominent U.S. cities for an appropriate artist, Gibson contracted [[Thomas Ridgeway Gould]], a Boston sculptor living abroad in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], to create the statue.<ref>Wharton, Glenn. 2012. ''The Painted King: Art, Activism, and Authenticity in Hawai''{{okina}}i. University of Hawai{{okina}} Press: 20</ref>\n\nBy 1880, Gould finished the full-size plaster model for the work and sent it to the Barbedienne Foundry in [[Paris]], [[France]] to be cast in brass. The finished brass sculpture was shipped from [[Bremen]], [[Germany]] in August 1880 en route to Hawai{{okina}}i, but after encountering a storm in the south Atlantic, a fire broke out on deck and the ship sank near the [[Falkland Islands]]. Its entire cargo, including the sculpture, was presumed lost. When news of the shipwreck reached Honolulu, officials decided to commission a second cast using the insurance funds collected after the loss of the original. Ironically, and unbeknownst to Honolulu officials, fishermen managed to recover the sunken statue, which was recognized and bought by a British ship captain who then sold it in 1882 to the Hawaiian government for $875. Now in possession of two identical statues, government officials decided to place the second cast, in considerably better condition than the original that had been damaged in the shipwreck, in the location originally intended to receive the statue, the [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]] government building in Honolulu. After some debate, the original was installed near Kamehameha I's birthplace in North Kohala. Due to the shipwreck, neither statue was on-hand in Hawai{{okina}}i to fulfill Gibson's original plan of celebrating the 100th anniversary of Cook's arrival to the islands. However, Gibson was able to convince King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] to incorporate the unveiling of the Honolulu cast into his coronation ceremonies in February, 1883.<ref>Wharton, 39.</ref>\n\n===Features===\nDuring the initial stages of the statue's design, Gould and Gibson made efforts to create an accurate likeness of King Kamehameha's face, body, and clothing. This proved to be a challenging task, as there was no consensus on what exactly Kamehameha I looked like. When in Boston, Gibson provided Gould with an engraving of King Kamehameha, a French copy of a Chinese copy of the king's official watercolor portrait by Russian artist Louis Choris in 1816.<ref>Wharton, 22.</ref>  Gibson directed Gould to use this copy of a copy of a copy, but to portray Kamehameha at approximately age forty-five, much younger than he appeared in the original watercolor. Attention was also focused on the proper way to depict Kamehameha's body; it was eventually determined that to convey his heroic and larger-than-life status, Kamehameha should be depicted with typical Herculean features, including a broad back and shoulders, strong, powerful arms, and a commanding chin. \n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Augustus of Prima Porta]]\nSome evidence exists to support the claim that Gould used the Roman sculpture of Augustus Caesar from Prima Porta (see [[Augustus of Prima Porta]]) as a model for ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast). The Augustus sculpture was well known throughout the United States and Europe at the time, and would most certainly have been known by Gould, whose neoclassical work was often inspired by Classical pieces. In addition, there are striking similarities between the Augustus of Prima Porta and ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast), including the raised right arm and the fact that Kamehameha holds his spear in his left hand like Augustus, even though Kamehameha was thought to have been right-handed.<ref>Charlot, John. 1979. \u201cThat Statue of Kamehameha.\u201d Honolulu 13 (9): 35-40.</ref>  It has been argued that this fusion of Hawaiian cultural attributes with Roman heroic imagery was a deliberate attempt to portray Kamehameha I as a \u201cPacific Hero\u201d and bolster the Hawaiian monarchy at a time of political and economic instability.<ref>Wharton, 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Tamatoa Baker modeling as Kamehameha I, composite (PP-67-8-013).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photograph of [[John Timoteo Baker]], by [[Christian Hedemann]], composite version]]\nFor use as reference for Gould, King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] commissioned a series of photographs of Hawaiians modeling King Kamehameha's \nOf the photographs that were sent to Gould, certain features of the statues were influenced by Hawaiian brothers [[John Timoteo Baker]] and [[Robert Hoapili Baker]].

The sash consists of a central band of tiny red feathers, likely from the {{okina}}i{{okina}}iwi, the [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]] (Vestiaria coccinea), surrounded on either side by bands of yellow feathers from the [[\u02bb\u014d\u02bb\u014d]] (Moho nobilis). The {{okina}}ahu {{okina}}ula is composed of nearly 450,000 golden feathers from the now-extinct [[mamo]].<ref>Rose, Roger G. 1978. ''Symbols of Sovereignty: Feather Girdles of Tahiti and Hawai{{okina}}i''. Honolulu: Bernice P. Bishop Museum.</ref>\n\nIn order to avoid criticism from both American and Native Hawaiian critics, Gould and [[Kal\u0101kaua]] made an effort to observe the many complex customs and ritualistic insignia needed to produce an accurate representation of a high-ranking Native Hawaiian chief. Still, some aspects of Kamehameha's depiction draw heavy criticism to this day. The main point of contention is the pair of sandals adorning Kamehameha's feet. While at the time, Hawaiians did wear sandals, it was only for traveling long distances or over heavy terrain, and the obviously Western Classical style of the shoes only compounds their inaccuracy. Additional problems include the fact that Kamehameha's sash drags on the ground behind him like a royal European train (an arrangement that would be considered degrading by Native Hawaiians and that would also damage the delicate feathers composing the sash), and Gould's decision to adorn the cloak with a European-style tassel.<ref>Brigham, W.T. 1899. \"Hawaiian Featherwork.\u201d Bishop Museum Memoirs 1: 1.</ref>  Although no early criticisms on the subject have been found, contemporary critics also take issue with Kamehameha's open-hand gesture, since traditional Hawaiian beckons are made with the palm down, not the palm up.<ref>Wharton, 28.</ref>\n\n==Conservation history==\nThroughout its history, maintenance of the sculpture has proven to be challenging to carry out due to jurisdictional confusion\u2014though the statue is located on county land, it is unclear if it belongs to the state or not, and therefore deciding who should be responsible for caring for it can be difficult to determine. Older residents of the island claim that during the plantation era, the sugar company bosses maintained the sculpture. Sometime after World War II, the County Department of Public Works in [[Hilo, Hawaii]] assumed responsibility for the statue's care; after government reorganization in 1973, the crew tasked with cleaning and repainting the sculpture was transferred to state control. Having little to no experience caring for public works of art, the crews often utilized materials and techniques that would be considered aggressive and potentially damaging by modern art conservators, including wire brushes, power washers, and house paint. When funds for this maintenance dried up in 1992, state crews stopped repainting the sculpture. Though the Art in Public Places Division of the [[Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts]] maintains most Hawaiian public art, including ''Kamehameha the Great'' (second cast), it does not allocate funds to care for the North Kohala cast. Local residents suspect this may be due to the agency's disapproval of painting the sculpture. Between 1992 and 2001, any repainting and general maintenance the statue received was from local volunteers working with common household materials.<ref>Wharton, 98-101.</ref>\n\nIn early 2001, Honolulu-contracted and the California-based conservator Glenn Wharton, who led an effort to conserve the statue. After helping to regild ''Kamehameha the Great'' (second cast) in 1994, Wharton visited the North Kohala statue in the spring of 1996 with the initial intent of determining and then restoring the statue to its original nineteenth-century appearance. Upon visiting the sculpture for the first time, Wharton discovered that the statue's current coat of paint had faded due to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet (UV)]] light from the Sun, was lifting in many areas, and in some places had flaked away completely to reveal underlying corrosion. Wharton later identified this as [[bronze disease]], a detrimental form of corrosion that can occur on [[copper]], brass, and [[bronze]] surfaces when exposed to chloride salts, water, and oxygen, and, when left untreated, can eat away into the surface of the metal. In addition, Wharton noted signs of corrosion of the interior [[iron]] armature (See [[armature (sculpture)]]), and stress cracks in the metal base, all issues which would need to be dealt with in the final treatment plan.<ref>Wharton, 5-6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the conservation of ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast) was determining the original appearance of the statue. Since conservators traditionally strive to uphold the artist's intent when caring for an artwork, figuring out this piece of information was of critical importance. While the Honolulu cast sported a patinated surface with gilt (See [[gilding]]) garments, the North Kohala cast had been painted in lifelike colors for as long as any local residents of the island could remember, and it wasn't clear whether the statue had been originally gilt or painted. Historical accounts provided little assistance to the investigation, as articles written on the sculpture at the time of its unveiling in the 1880s offered conflicting and often contradictory descriptions of the artwork. However, by analyzing paint chip samples taken from the statue's surface using [[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[X-ray diffraction]], Wharton was eventually able to gather evidence of 24kt gold leaf residue beneath the layers of paint, effectively concluding that the statue had, like its Honolulu counterpart, an original patinated and gilded surface.<ref>Wharton, 110.</ref>  Wharton theorized that because of damage caused by the shipwreck, the sculpture's surface had corroded badly before its eventual transport to Hawai{{okina}}i in 1883, and due to lack of materials and technical expertise to regild and patinate the surface, the statue was instead cleaned and then painted entirely brown in order to prepare it in time for [[Kal\u0101kaua]]\u2019s coronation ceremony. At some point between 1883 and 1912, the tradition of painting the sculpture in multiple colors began.<ref>Wharton, 111-112.</ref>\n\nBecause of the complexity of the decision as well as the deep cultural connection many local residents felt to the statue, Wharton devised a novel scheme to allow the Hawaiian people to decide if the statue should remain painted with lifelike colors or be restored to its original gilded appearance. An effort was made to interest young children and local students in the sculpture, in order to get adults talking about the Kamehameha the Great as a conservation object. Teachers coordinated art projects centering on the sculpture, and local community groups also got involved, making crafts and conducting research projects to increase awareness of the sculpture and the efforts to restore it. Journalists reported on the ongoing projects in the local newspapers, sometimes offering their own opinions on whether the statue should be painted or gilt.<ref>Wharton, 103-106.</ref>  Debate centered on whether it was best to restore the statue's gilded surface, which would uphold the artist's original intent and, some argued, make the statue more aesthetically appealing, or to repaint, which would honor a local tradition and increase the statue's lifelike appearance. Eventually, after listening to the input of the k\u016bpuna (community elders), who spoke out in favor of painting the sculpture, a local ballot was held in late 2000. The results were 71% in favor of repainting.<ref>Wharton, 135-138.</ref>\n\nHands-on work began on the sculpture in February 2001. After documenting the statue's initial condition, the paint was stripped away using a combination of [[pressure washers]], [[propane]] torching, and [[solvent]] application. Once the brass surface had been cleaned, Wharton assessed the various stress cracks and gouges in the metal and determined that the damage was all relatively old, probably dating back to the shipwreck and its recovery from the sea. (Ref: Wharton 148-152.) In addition, much of the bronze disease once visible on the surface of the sculpture had been blasted away during the paint stripping process. After it was determined that the statue was in stable condition, any holes or gaps in the metal were filled in using a pH-neutral [[epoxy putty]], and the brass surface was misted with a [[benzotriazole]] solution in order to prevent future corrosion. To repaint the sculpture, Wharton selected a hearty paint system that could withstand the harsh Hawaiian sun and rain, which consisted of an automotive [[epoxy]] primer (See [[primer (paint)]]), a [[polyurethane]] paint, and a polyurethane clear top coat. Special care was taken to choose the proper colors for Kamehameha's skin tone and red and yellow feathered garments.<ref>Wharton, 153-155.</ref>  Once the treatment was complete, Wharton helped train a group of local volunteers to carry out annual maintenance on the sculpture, and to watch for and record any condition changes or damage.\n\n==Spiritual and cultural significance==\nSince its unveiling in 1883, ''Kamehameha the Great'' has come to be regarded by Hawaiians as an important cultural, economic, and spiritual object. Despite its Western origins, influences and artist, and despite the fact that the statue was not considered a spiritual object at the time of its creation (Ref: Wharton, 78), some Hawaiians consider the statue a receptacle of [[mana]], a term that translates to \u201csupernatural or divine power,\u201d and associations have been drawn between it and [[ki\u02bbi]], figurative sculptures created by Native Hawaiians prior to Cook's arrival to the Islands. While scholars debate the exact functions of these sculptures, Hawaiian oral traditions describe that ki{{okina}}i could represent various entities, including akua (spirits, divinities) and manifestations of natural phenomena, and could serve as \u0101umaka sculptures (family or personal gods, deified ancestors). It was believed that through various prayers and ho\u2018okupu (offerings), the mana held within these figures increased.<ref>Cox, J. Halley, and William H. Davenport. 1988. ''Hawaiian Sculpture''. Honolulu: University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press.; Valeri, Valerio. 1985. ''Kingship and Sacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.</ref>  For some Hawaiians, any image of Kamehameha is considered a very strong ki{{okina}}i, even a Western facsimile such as ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast), and it is common to find offerings of food, ribbons, and p\u014dhaku left as tribute upon the sculpture's pedestal. Even Hawaiians who do not believe the statue contains mana often still respect the statue as a representation of the spirit of Kamehameha I, and regard it as a connection to their ancestral history.<ref>Wharton, 77-81.</ref>\n\nOne of the statue's most important cultural functions is its role in the annual celebration of [[Kamehameha Day]], a two-day festival starting on June 11 in which much of the Hawaiian population participates. Activities include [[hula]], chanting, singing, and telling stories about Kamehameha and the significance of the holiday. Various cultural groups, including representatives of each island, travel to the sculpture to present and drape it with long lei (See [[lei (garland)]].) In addition, a parade takes place during the festival, beginning in H\u0101w\u012b (See Hawi, Hawaii) and ending at a location just past the sculpture in Kapa{{okina}}au. Those participating often stop at the sculpture to bestow offerings before moving on.<ref>Wharton, 88.</ref>\n\n''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast) has also become an important political symbol for the Hawaiian Islands. It is featured on the official Hawaiian state seal (See [[Seal of Hawaii]]), and in the logo of the [[Kamehameha Schools]], which has campuses located throughout the Islands. In 1959, a [[Kamehameha I (Gould)|replica of the statue]] was cast and placed inside the [[United States Capitol]] as part of the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] to honor Hawai{{okina}}i becoming the fiftieth state. Various businesses, especially those working in the tourist trade, have capitalized on the resulting popularity of the sculpture; its image has been used to decorate brochures, postcards, T-shirts, folk-art, etc., and small reproductions of the sculpture are popular souvenirs in many shops.<ref>Wharton, 92.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Kamehameha Statue (Kapa\u02bbau)}}\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n{{coord|20.23029|-155.79831|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-HI|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hawaii County, Hawaii]]\n[[Category:1883 establishments in Hawaii]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Kamehameha'' statue (original cast)}}\n[[File:FEMA - 26842 - Photograph by Adam Dubrowa taken on 11-01-2006 in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n\nThe '''''Kamehameha I''''' statue (original cast) is an [[outdoor sculpture]] by American artist [[Thomas Ridgeway Gould]], cast in 1880 and installed in 1883.

In addition, there are striking similarities between the Augustus of Prima Porta and ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast), including the raised right arm and the fact that Kamehameha holds his spear in his left hand like Augustus, even though Kamehameha was thought to have been right-handed.<ref>Charlot, John. 1979. \u201cThat Statue of Kamehameha.\u201d Honolulu 13 (9): 35-40.</ref>  It has been argued that this fusion of Hawaiian cultural attributes with Roman heroic imagery was a deliberate attempt to portray Kamehameha I as a \u201cPacific Hero\u201d and bolster the Hawaiian monarchy at a time of political and economic instability.<ref>Wharton, 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Timoteo Baker modeling as Kamehameha I, composite (PP-67-8-013).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photograph of [[John Timoteo Baker]], by [[Christian Hedemann]], composite version]]\nFor use as reference for Gould, King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] commissioned a series of photographs of Hawaiians modeling King Kamehameha's \nOf the photographs that were sent to Gould, certain features of the statues were influenced by Hawaiian brothers [[John Timoteo Baker]] and [[Robert Hoapili Baker]].

The sash consists of a central band of tiny red feathers, likely from the {{okina}}i{{okina}}iwi, the [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]] (Vestiaria coccinea), surrounded on either side by bands of yellow feathers from the [[\u02bb\u014d\u02bb\u014d]] (Moho nobilis). The {{okina}}ahu {{okina}}ula is composed of nearly 450,000 golden feathers from the now-extinct [[mamo]].<ref>Rose, Roger G. 1978. ''Symbols of Sovereignty: Feather Girdles of Tahiti and Hawai{{okina}}i''. Honolulu: Bernice P. Bishop Museum.</ref>\n\nIn order to avoid criticism from both American and Native Hawaiian critics, Gould and [[Kal\u0101kaua]] made an effort to observe the many complex customs and ritualistic insignia needed to produce an accurate representation of a high-ranking Native Hawaiian chief. Still, some aspects of Kamehameha's depiction draw heavy criticism to this day. The main point of contention is the pair of sandals adorning Kamehameha's feet. While at the time, Hawaiians did wear sandals, it was only for traveling long distances or over heavy terrain, and the obviously Western Classical style of the shoes only compounds their inaccuracy. Additional problems include the fact that Kamehameha's sash drags on the ground behind him like a royal European train (an arrangement that would be considered degrading by Native Hawaiians and that would also damage the delicate feathers composing the sash), and Gould's decision to adorn the cloak with a European-style tassel.<ref>Brigham, W.T. 1899. \"Hawaiian Featherwork.\u201d Bishop Museum Memoirs 1: 1.</ref>  Although no early criticisms on the subject have been found, contemporary critics also take issue with Kamehameha's open-hand gesture, since traditional Hawaiian beckons are made with the palm down, not the palm up.<ref>Wharton, 28.</ref>\n\n==Conservation history==\nThroughout its history, maintenance of the sculpture has proven to be challenging to carry out due to jurisdictional confusion\u2014though the statue is located on county land, it is unclear if it belongs to the state or not, and therefore deciding who should be responsible for caring for it can be difficult to determine. Older residents of the island claim that during the plantation era, the sugar company bosses maintained the sculpture. Sometime after World War II, the County Department of Public Works in [[Hilo, Hawaii]] assumed responsibility for the statue's care; after government reorganization in 1973, the crew tasked with cleaning and repainting the sculpture was transferred to state control. Having little to no experience caring for public works of art, the crews often utilized materials and techniques that would be considered aggressive and potentially damaging by modern art conservators, including wire brushes, power washers, and house paint. When funds for this maintenance dried up in 1992, state crews stopped repainting the sculpture. Though the Art in Public Places Division of the [[Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts]] maintains most Hawaiian public art, including ''Kamehameha the Great'' (second cast), it does not allocate funds to care for the North Kohala cast. Local residents suspect this may be due to the agency's disapproval of painting the sculpture. Between 1992 and 2001, any repainting and general maintenance the statue received was from local volunteers working with common household materials.<ref>Wharton, 98-101.</ref>\n\nIn early 2001, Honolulu-contracted and the California-based conservator Glenn Wharton, who led an effort to conserve the statue. After helping to regild ''Kamehameha the Great'' (second cast) in 1994, Wharton visited the North Kohala statue in the spring of 1996 with the initial intent of determining and then restoring the statue to its original nineteenth-century appearance. Upon visiting the sculpture for the first time, Wharton discovered that the statue's current coat of paint had faded due to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet (UV)]] light from the Sun, was lifting in many areas, and in some places had flaked away completely to reveal underlying corrosion. Wharton later identified this as [[bronze disease]], a detrimental form of corrosion that can occur on [[copper]], brass, and [[bronze]] surfaces when exposed to chloride salts, water, and oxygen, and, when left untreated, can eat away into the surface of the metal. In addition, Wharton noted signs of corrosion of the interior [[iron]] armature (See [[armature (sculpture)]]), and stress cracks in the metal base, all issues which would need to be dealt with in the final treatment plan.<ref>Wharton, 5-6.</ref>\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the conservation of ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast) was determining the original appearance of the statue. Since conservators traditionally strive to uphold the artist's intent when caring for an artwork, figuring out this piece of information was of critical importance. While the Honolulu cast sported a patinated surface with gilt (See [[gilding]]) garments, the North Kohala cast had been painted in lifelike colors for as long as any local residents of the island could remember, and it wasn't clear whether the statue had been originally gilt or painted. Historical accounts provided little assistance to the investigation, as articles written on the sculpture at the time of its unveiling in the 1880s offered conflicting and often contradictory descriptions of the artwork. However, by analyzing paint chip samples taken from the statue's surface using [[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[X-ray diffraction]], Wharton was eventually able to gather evidence of 24kt gold leaf residue beneath the layers of paint, effectively concluding that the statue had, like its Honolulu counterpart, an original patinated and gilded surface.<ref>Wharton, 110.</ref>  Wharton theorized that because of damage caused by the shipwreck, the sculpture's surface had corroded badly before its eventual transport to Hawai{{okina}}i in 1883, and due to lack of materials and technical expertise to regild and patinate the surface, the statue was instead cleaned and then painted entirely brown in order to prepare it in time for [[Kal\u0101kaua]]\u2019s coronation ceremony. At some point between 1883 and 1912, the tradition of painting the sculpture in multiple colors began.<ref>Wharton, 111-112.</ref>\n\nBecause of the complexity of the decision as well as the deep cultural connection many local residents felt to the statue, Wharton devised a novel scheme to allow the Hawaiian people to decide if the statue should remain painted with lifelike colors or be restored to its original gilded appearance. An effort was made to interest young children and local students in the sculpture, in order to get adults talking about the Kamehameha the Great as a conservation object. Teachers coordinated art projects centering on the sculpture, and local community groups also got involved, making crafts and conducting research projects to increase awareness of the sculpture and the efforts to restore it. Journalists reported on the ongoing projects in the local newspapers, sometimes offering their own opinions on whether the statue should be painted or gilt.<ref>Wharton, 103-106.</ref>  Debate centered on whether it was best to restore the statue's gilded surface, which would uphold the artist's original intent and, some argued, make the statue more aesthetically appealing, or to repaint, which would honor a local tradition and increase the statue's lifelike appearance. Eventually, after listening to the input of the k\u016bpuna (community elders), who spoke out in favor of painting the sculpture, a local ballot was held in late 2000. The results were 71% in favor of repainting.<ref>Wharton, 135-138.</ref>\n\nHands-on work began on the sculpture in February 2001. After documenting the statue's initial condition, the paint was stripped away using a combination of [[pressure washers]], [[propane]] torching, and [[solvent]] application. Once the brass surface had been cleaned, Wharton assessed the various stress cracks and gouges in the metal and determined that the damage was all relatively old, probably dating back to the shipwreck and its recovery from the sea. (Ref: Wharton 148-152.) In addition, much of the bronze disease once visible on the surface of the sculpture had been blasted away during the paint stripping process. After it was determined that the statue was in stable condition, any holes or gaps in the metal were filled in using a pH-neutral [[epoxy putty]], and the brass surface was misted with a [[benzotriazole]] solution in order to prevent future corrosion. To repaint the sculpture, Wharton selected a hearty paint system that could withstand the harsh Hawaiian sun and rain, which consisted of an automotive [[epoxy]] primer (See [[primer (paint)]]), a [[polyurethane]] paint, and a polyurethane clear top coat. Special care was taken to choose the proper colors for Kamehameha's skin tone and red and yellow feathered garments.<ref>Wharton, 153-155.</ref>  Once the treatment was complete, Wharton helped train a group of local volunteers to carry out annual maintenance on the sculpture, and to watch for and record any condition changes or damage.\n\n==Spiritual and cultural significance==\nSince its unveiling in 1883, ''Kamehameha the Great'' has come to be regarded by Hawaiians as an important cultural, economic, and spiritual object. Despite its Western origins, influences and artist, and despite the fact that the statue was not considered a spiritual object at the time of its creation (Ref: Wharton, 78), some Hawaiians consider the statue a receptacle of [[mana]], a term that translates to \u201csupernatural or divine power,\u201d and associations have been drawn between it and [[ki\u02bbi]], figurative sculptures created by Native Hawaiians prior to Cook's arrival to the Islands. While scholars debate the exact functions of these sculptures, Hawaiian oral traditions describe that ki{{okina}}i could represent various entities, including akua (spirits, divinities) and manifestations of natural phenomena, and could serve as \u0101umaka sculptures (family or personal gods, deified ancestors). It was believed that through various prayers and ho\u2018okupu (offerings), the mana held within these figures increased.<ref>Cox, J. Halley, and William H. Davenport. 1988. ''Hawaiian Sculpture''. Honolulu: University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press.; Valeri, Valerio. 1985. ''Kingship and Sacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.</ref>  For some Hawaiians, any image of Kamehameha is considered a very strong ki{{okina}}i, even a Western facsimile such as ''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast), and it is common to find offerings of food, ribbons, and p\u014dhaku left as tribute upon the sculpture's pedestal. Even Hawaiians who do not believe the statue contains mana often still respect the statue as a representation of the spirit of Kamehameha I, and regard it as a connection to their ancestral history.<ref>Wharton, 77-81.</ref>\n\nOne of the statue's most important cultural functions is its role in the annual celebration of [[Kamehameha Day]], a two-day festival starting on June 11 in which much of the Hawaiian population participates. Activities include [[hula]], chanting, singing, and telling stories about Kamehameha and the significance of the holiday. Various cultural groups, including representatives of each island, travel to the sculpture to present and drape it with long lei (See [[lei (garland)]].) In addition, a parade takes place during the festival, beginning in H\u0101w\u012b (See Hawi, Hawaii) and ending at a location just past the sculpture in Kapa{{okina}}au. Those participating often stop at the sculpture to bestow offerings before moving on.<ref>Wharton, 88.</ref>\n\n''Kamehameha the Great'' (original cast) has also become an important political symbol for the Hawaiian Islands. It is featured on the official Hawaiian state seal (See [[Seal of Hawaii]]), and in the logo of the [[Kamehameha Schools]], which has campuses located throughout the Islands. In 1959, a [[Kamehameha I (Gould)|replica of the statue]] was cast and placed inside the [[United States Capitol]] as part of the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] to honor Hawai{{okina}}i becoming the fiftieth state. Various businesses, especially those working in the tourist trade, have capitalized on the resulting popularity of the sculpture; its image has been used to decorate brochures, postcards, T-shirts, folk-art, etc., and small reproductions of the sculpture are popular souvenirs in many shops.<ref>Wharton, 92.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Kamehameha Statue (Kapa\u02bbau)}}\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n{{coord|20.23029|-155.79831|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-HI|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hawaii County, Hawaii]]\n[[Category:1883 establishments in Hawaii]]\n", "name_user": "KAVEBEAR", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:John Timoteo Baker modeling as Kamehameha I, composite (PP-67-8-013).jpg\u2192File:John Tamatoa Baker modeling as Kamehameha I, composite (PP-67-8-013).jpg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_statue_(original_cast)"}

Its objective was to obtain the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of the [[Earth]]. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard ''Endeavour'' during its 11-day mission. This radar system gathered around 8 terabytes of data to produce high-quality 3-D images of the Earth's surface.\n\nSRTM used C-band and X-band [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (IFSAR) to acquire topographic data of Earth's land mass (between 60\u00b0N and 56\u00b0S). It produced digital topographic map products which met Interferometric Terrain Height Data (ITHD)-2 specifications (30 meter x 30 meter spatial sampling with 16 meter absolute vertical height accuracy, 10 meter relative vertical height accuracy and 20 meter absolute horizontal circular accuracy). The result of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was close to 1&nbsp;trillion measurements of the Earth's topography. Besides contributing to the production of better maps, these measurements could lead to improved water drainage modeling, more realistic flight simulators, better locations for cell phone towers, and enhanced navigation safety.\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission mast was deployed successfully to its full length, and the antenna was turned to its operation position. After a successful checkout of the radar systems, mapping began at 00:31 EST, less than 12 hours after launch. Crewmembers split into two shifts so they could work around the clock, and began mapping an area from [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] to [[56th parallel south|56 degrees south]]. Data was sent to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] for analysis, and early indications showed the data to be of excellent quality.\n\n[[File:Aterrizaje endeavour.jpg|thumb|STS-99 ends as Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' lands at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]], 22 February 2000.]]\n\nMapping proceeded fairly smoothly, but during an attitude-hold period for payload mapping during the second day of flight, it was determined that orbiter propellant usage had doubled from 0.07 to 0.15% an hour. The increase was caused by a failure of the payload cold-gas thrust system that was used to offset the gravity gradient torque of the mast. As a result of this failure, orbiter propellant was being used at a higher-than-planned rate to maintain the attitude of the vehicle. Measures to reduce the expenditure were evaluated and based on the analysis, enough propellant could be saved to complete the planned 9-day plus science mission.\n\nThe first of a series of \"flycast\" maneuvers during the mission was also made on the second day of flight. The flycast maneuver was designed to reduce strain on the almost 200 foot (60 m) mast extending from ''Endeavour''{{'}}s payload bay when adjustments to ''Endeavour''{{'}}s orbit were needed.\n\nThe orbiter, which flew tail-first during mapping operations, was moved to a nose-first attitude with the mast extending upward. A brief reaction control system pulse began the maneuver. This caused the mast to deflect slightly backwards then rebound forward. As it reached vertical, a stronger thrust was applied, arresting the mast's motion and increasing the orbiter's speed.\n\nRadar data gathering concluded at 06:54 EST on the tenth day of flight after a final sweep across Australia. During 222 hours and 23 minutes of mapping, ''Endeavour''{{'}}s radar images filled 332 high density tapes and covered 99.98% of the planned mapping area \u2013 land between [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] latitude and [[56th parallel south|56 degrees south]] latitude \u2013 at least once and 94.6% of it twice. Only about {{convert|80000|sqmi|km2}} in scattered areas remained unimaged, most of them in North America and most already well mapped by other methods. Enough data was gathered to fill the equivalent of 20,000 [[compact disc|CD]]s.\n\nAlso aboard ''Endeavour'' was a student experiment called [[EarthKAM]], which took 2,715 digital photos during the mission through an overhead flight-deck window. The NASA-sponsored program allowed middle school students to select photo targets and receive the images via the Internet. The pictures were used in classroom projects on Earth science, geography, mathematics and space science. More than 75 [[middle school]]s around the world participated in the experiment, which set a record. On four previous flights combined, EarthKAM sent down a total of 2,018 images.\n\nSTS-99 also saw the recommissioning of the [[Spacelab]] pallet system, despite the Spacelab system being discontinued almost two years prior.\n\nThe 2007 [[Smithsonian Networks]] documentary Oasis Earth was made about the mission, containing HD video from inside ''Endeavour'', including many views looking at the Earth below. One highlight of the documentary features [[Mamoru Mohri]] shooting video of the Moon and [[Mount Fuji]].\n\nThis was the last mission to fly with the original Space Shuttle cockpit layout in 18 straight years.

The primary objective of the mission was the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM) project. This was also the last solo flight of ''Endeavour''; all future flights for ''Endeavour'' became devoted to the [[International Space Station]]. This was also the first shuttle mission of the 2000s.\n\n==Crew==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology       = Astronaut\n|position1         = Commander\n|crew1_up          = {{flagicon|USA}} [[Kevin R.

Its objective was to obtain the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of the [[Earth]]. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard ''Endeavour'' during its 11-day mission. This radar system gathered around 8 terabytes of data to produce high-quality 3-D images of the Earth's surface.\n\nSRTM used C-band and X-band [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (IFSAR) to acquire topographic data of Earth's land mass (between 60\u00b0N and 56\u00b0S). It produced digital topographic map products which met Interferometric Terrain Height Data (ITHD)-2 specifications (30 meter x 30 meter spatial sampling with 16 meter absolute vertical height accuracy, 10 meter relative vertical height accuracy and 20 meter absolute horizontal circular accuracy). The result of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was close to 1&nbsp;trillion measurements of the Earth's topography. Besides contributing to the production of better maps, these measurements could lead to improved water drainage modeling, more realistic flight simulators, better locations for cell phone towers, and enhanced navigation safety.\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission mast was deployed successfully to its full length, and the antenna was turned to its operation position. After a successful checkout of the radar systems, mapping began at 00:31 EST, less than 12 hours after launch. Crewmembers split into two shifts so they could work around the clock, and began mapping an area from [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] to [[56th parallel south|56 degrees south]]. Data was sent to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] for analysis, and early indications showed the data to be of excellent quality.\n\n[[File:Aterrizaje endeavour.jpg|thumb|STS-99 ends as Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' lands at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]], 22 February 2000.]]\n\nMapping proceeded fairly smoothly, but during an attitude-hold period for payload mapping during the second day of flight, it was determined that orbiter propellant usage had doubled from 0.07 to 0.15% an hour. The increase was caused by a failure of the payload cold-gas thrust system that was used to offset the gravity gradient torque of the mast. As a result of this failure, orbiter propellant was being used at a higher-than-planned rate to maintain the attitude of the vehicle. Measures to reduce the expenditure were evaluated and based on the analysis, enough propellant could be saved to complete the planned 9-day plus science mission.\n\nThe first of a series of \"flycast\" maneuvers during the mission was also made on the second day of flight. The flycast maneuver was designed to reduce strain on the almost 200 foot (60 m) mast extending from ''Endeavour'''s payload bay when adjustments to ''Endeavour'''s orbit were needed.\n\nThe orbiter, which flew tail-first during mapping operations, was moved to a nose-first attitude with the mast extending upward. A brief reaction control system pulse began the maneuver. This caused the mast to deflect slightly backwards then rebound forward. As it reached vertical, a stronger thrust was applied, arresting the mast's motion and increasing the orbiter's speed.\n\nRadar data gathering concluded at 06:54 EST on the tenth day of flight after a final sweep across Australia. During 222 hours and 23 minutes of mapping, ''Endeavour'''s radar images filled 332 high density tapes and covered 99.98% of the planned mapping area \u2013 land between [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] latitude and [[56th parallel south|56 degrees south]] latitude \u2013 at least once and 94.6% of it twice. Only about {{convert|80000|sqmi|km2}} in scattered areas remained unimaged, most of them in North America and most already well mapped by other methods. Enough data was gathered to fill the equivalent of 20,000 [[compact disc|CD]]s.\n\nAlso aboard ''Endeavour'' was a student experiment called [[EarthKAM]], which took 2,715 digital photos during the mission through an overhead flight-deck window. The NASA-sponsored program allowed middle school students to select photo targets and receive the images via the Internet. The pictures were used in classroom projects on Earth science, geography, mathematics and space science. More than 75 [[middle school]]s around the world participated in the experiment, which set a record. On four previous flights combined, EarthKAM sent down a total of 2,018 images.\n\nSTS-99 also saw the recommissioning of the [[Spacelab]] pallet system, despite the Spacelab system being discontinued almost two years prior.\n\nThe 2007 [[Smithsonian Networks]] documentary Oasis Earth was made about the mission, containing HD video from inside ''Endeavour'', including many views looking at the Earth below. One highlight of the documentary features [[Mamoru Mohri]] shooting video of the Moon and [[Mount Fuji]].\n\nThis was the last mission to fly with the original Space Shuttle cockpit layout in 18 straight years. Although the next mission ([[STS-101]]) featured the \"glass cockpit\" on ''Atlantis'', ''Endeavour'' and sister orbiter ''Discovery'' continued flying with the original cockpit layout until after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n{{LaunchAttempt\n| date1           = 20000131 12:47:00\n| result1         = scrubbed\n| reason1         = technical\n| decision_date1  = 20000131 02:08:00\n| weathergo1         = 60%\n| notes1          = avionics problem<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/STS-99_Archive.txt|title=Shuttle Endeavour grounded by weather, avionics problem |publisher=CBS News|accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref>\n| date2           = 20000201 12:44:00\n| result2         = scrubbed\n| reason2         = technical\n| decision_date2  = 20000201 03:30:00\n| notes2          = avionics problem<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/STS-99_Archive.txt|title=MEC replacement ordered; launch postponed to at least Feb.&nbsp;9 |publisher=CBS News|accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref>\n| date3           = 20000211 12:30:00\n| result3         = success\n| weathergo3         = 90%\n\n}}\n\n== Wake-up calls ==\nNASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the [[Gemini program]], which was first used to wake up a flight crew during [[Apollo 15]].<ref name=\"chronology\">\n{{cite news\n| first = Colin\n| last = Fries\n| title = Chronology of Wakeup Calls\n| date = 25 June 2007\n| publisher = NASA\n| url = https://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf\n| format = PDF\n| access-date = 13 August 2007\n| url-status = dead\n| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5qa43IOoy?url=http://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf\n| archive-date = 18 June 2010\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\nEach track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.<ref name=\"chronology\" /><ref name=\"wakeup\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/audio/shuttle/sts-99/html/ndxpage1.html\n| title = STS-99 Wakeup Calls\n| accessdate = 31 July 2009\n| publisher = NASA\n| date = 11 May 2009\n| author = NASA\n}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He writes in five languages, namely, Persian, English, Spanish, Italian, and French.\n\n==Biography==\nBahman Sholevar was born in Tehran on February 6, 1941, in a politically conscious family.  His paternal grandfather had fought alongside [[Sattar Khan]] and [[Bagher Khan]] in the Constitutional Revolution of 1905 of Iran, and his paternal grandmother was the sister of the famous [[Mohammad Khiabani|Sheikh Mohammad Khiabani]], another of the freedom fighters for the Iranian Constitution.  His father, born in Tabriz, was the first graduate of the Law School of the University of Tehran.  He was a judge, a lawyer, and the publisher and editor of the newspaper [[Sholevar]].  He also had published a small book of verse in his youth.  Bahman's mother was among the first group of nurses graduating from the University of Tehran.\n\nBahman Sholevar finished his elementary and secondary educations in Tehran.  He studied Medicine at the University of Tehran, but left his studies before receiving his MD degree to accept a diplomatic post in Turkey, as the Economic Secretary of the [[Central Treaty Organization|Central Treaty Organization (CENTO)]].  He used this position to get the publication permit in Iran for his novel ''The Night's Journey'', a novel which he had written six years earlier but which no publisher had dared to send to the censors' office for a publication permit.  He had foreseen that the novel would be banned after publication and that his life would be in danger.  ''The Night's Journey'' was banned a few months after its publication and the author was able to escape to the United States on his diplomatic passport.  He received a fellowship to the University of Iowa's International Writing Program for 1968\u20131969 and a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. in English at the University of Iowa.  (He had a Diploma of English Studies from the University of Cambridge and a B.A. in English from the University of North Texas.)  After receiving degrees of ''M.F.A., M.A. '', and ''Ph.D.'' in ''English and Modern Letters'' (1968\u20131973) he re-studied Medicine at Hahnemann University of Philadelphia and received his M.D. degree in 1976.  He followed specialty training in psychiatry at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and became a diplomate of the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] and began teaching at Thomas Jefferson University and other Philadelphia area universities.  He has been an elected Fellow of the Philadelphia College of Physicians and an elected member of [[New York Academy of Sciences]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1979 Sholevar was an active and vocal opponent of the Shah's regime and an advocate for freedom and human rights in Iran, until the latter's overthrow by the Iranian revolution of 1979.  Immediately after that revolution, he became an equally vocal and active opponent of the corrupt theocratic tyranny that replaced the corrupt secular tyranny of the Shah.  In a satiric poem \"An Ode to the Revolution\" which he published in 1980 he wrote:\n\n         This well-favored friend, one more \n         Time after a thousand, has deceived us...\n         The crowned butcher is gone; on his \n         Throne sits the turbaned butcher.\n         But the play is the same,\n         The same the players, \n         With a thousand new masks,\n         But with one difference:\n         Yesterday's wolves are today's lambs.\n\nAnd in his novel ''Dead Reckoning'', the protagonist returns to Iran to attend his mother's funeral, after 15 years of being away, only to be handcuffed and blindfolded and be taken away to Evin prison, to be tortured by the same torturers who had tortured his brother to death 17 years earlier.  The only difference is that this time the torturers have full beards and praying beads and recite \"In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,\" before they torture.\n\nIn 2007, after 42 years in self-imposed exile, Sholevar returned to Iran at the invitation of a group of writers and publishers.  His translations of Faulkner and T. S. Eliot had been given the reprint permits and the Persian version of his latest novel, ''Dead Reckoning'', had been submitted by a publisher to the Censors' Office (euphemistically called \"the Office of Islamic Guidance.\"Even though the program to honor him at the \"House of Art\" was banned by the authorities, the reception and welcome by the writers and the newspapers and magazines were so profuse that finally even the government's radio and television decided to join the flood of interview-seekers.\n\nHe extended his self-imposed exile in the United States indefinitely and became a citizen of the United States in 1981.  He did not visit Iran again until 2007, after 42 years of absence.  Even though his translations have been allowed republication in Iran, his original writings still are under a ban.  His last novel in Persian, titled ''Bi Lengar'', has been awaiting a publication permit for nearly two years from the Censorship office of the Islamic Republic of Iran (euphemistically called \u201cDepartment of Culture and Islamic Guidance.\u201d\n\nSholevar currently resides in Pennsylvania and writes in five languages, English, Persian, Spanish, Italian, and French.  Though most of his publications in the past forty years have been in English, or other European languages.\n\n===Major works===\n\n====Poetry ====\n#\t''Epic of Life, Epic of Death'', ''\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0633\u06c0 \u0645\u0631\u06af \u060c \u062d\u0645\u0627\u0633\u06c0 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u064d'' (Tehran: 1960).\n#\t''Making Connection: Poems of Exile'' (Philadelphia: 1979).\n#\t\u201dAn Ode to Revolution\u201d (Satirical poem), ''Iranshahr'', vol. iii, no. 7, May 1960.\n#\t\u201dA Blood Covenant\u201d,  ''Iranshahr'', vol. iii, no. 16, July 1960.\n#\t''The Angel with Bush-Baby Eyes and other poems'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''The Love Song of Achilles and other poems'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''Odysseus' Homecoming'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''The New Adam: Poems of Renewal'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''Rooted in Volcanic Ashes'' (Philadelphia: 1988)\n#\t''\"Four poems\"'' in North Atlantic Review: ''Writers in Exile'', no. 4, 1992.\n#\t''Il Rimpatrio d'Odysseo/ Odysseus' Homecoming'' (Italian-English) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n\n====Novel ====\n#\t''\u0633\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0628 (Safar-e-Shab) '', Khoosheh Publications, (Tehran :1976)\n#\t''The Night's Journey & the Coming of the Messiah'', No. 7 in Modern Persian Literature Series of Columbia University's Bibliotheca Persica, (Philadelphia: 1984)\n#\tExcerpts from the novel ''Dead Reckoning'', in North Atlantic Review: Writers in Exile, No 4, 1992.\n#\t''Dead Reckoning'' (English Original) (Philadelphia: 1992)\n#\t''A La Deriva'' (Spanish Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''Alla Deriva'' (Italian Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u00c0 La D\u00e9rive'' (French Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u0628\u06cc \u0644\u0646\u06af\u0631 (Bi Lengar) '' (Persian Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0634\u0628 \u0648\u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a (Safar-e-Shab va Zohoor-e-Hazrat)'' (Philadelphia: 2009)\n\n====Criticism====\n#\t\u201dAbout William Faulkner and The Sound and the Fury,\u201d Translator's Preface, Tehran, 1959.\n#\t\u201dAbout T.

He writes in five languages, namely, Persian, English, Spanish, Italian, and French.\n\n==Biography==\nBahman Sholevar was born in Tehran on February 6, 1941 in a politically conscious family.  His paternal grandfather had fought alongside [[Sattar Khan]] and [[Bagher Khan]] in the Constitutional Revolution of 1905 of Iran, and his paternal grandmother was the sister of the famous [[Mohammad Khiabani|Sheikh Mohammad Khiabani]], another of the freedom fighters for the Iranian Constitution.  His father, born in Tabriz, was the first graduate of the Law School of the University of Tehran.  He was a judge, a lawyer, and the publisher and editor of the newspaper [[Sholevar]].  He also had published a small book of verse in his youth.  Bahman's mother was among the first group of nurses graduating from the University of Tehran.\n\nBahman Sholevar finished his elementary and secondary educations in Tehran.  He studied Medicine at the University of Tehran, but left his studies before receiving his MD degree to accept a diplomatic post in Turkey, as the Economic Secretary of the [[Central Treaty Organization|Central Treaty Organization (CENTO)]].  He used this position to get the publication permit in Iran for his novel ''The Night's Journey'', a novel which he had written six years earlier but which no publisher had dared to send to the censors' office for a publication permit.  He had foreseen that the novel would be banned after publication and that his life would be in danger.  ''The Night's Journey'' was banned a few months after its publication and the author was able to escape to the United States on his diplomatic passport.  He received a fellowship to the University of Iowa's International Writing Program for 1968\u20131969 and a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. in English at the University of Iowa.  (He had a Diploma of English Studies from the University of Cambridge and a B.A. in English from the University of North Texas.)  After receiving degrees of ''M.F.A., M.A. '', and ''Ph.D.'' in ''English and Modern Letters'' (1968\u20131973) he re-studied Medicine at Hahnemann University of Philadelphia and received his M.D. degree in 1976.  He followed specialty training in psychiatry at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and became a diplomate of the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] and began teaching at Thomas Jefferson University and other Philadelphia area universities.  He has been an elected Fellow of the Philadelphia College of Physicians and an elected member of [[New York Academy of Sciences]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1979 Sholevar was an active and vocal opponent of the Shah\u2019s regime and an advocate for freedom and human rights in Iran, until the latter's overthrow by the Iranian revolution of 1979.  Immediately after that revolution, he became an equally vocal and active opponent of the corrupt theocratic tyranny that replaced the corrupt secular tyranny of the Shah.  In a satiric poem \"An Ode to the Revolution\" which he published in 1980 he wrote:\n\n         This well-favored friend, one more \n         Time after a thousand, has deceived us\u2026\n         The crowned butcher is gone; on his \n         Throne sits the turbaned butcher.\n         But the play is the same,\n         The same the players, \n         With a thousand new masks,\n         But with one difference:\n         Yesterday's wolves are today's lambs.\n\nAnd in his novel ''Dead Reckoning'', the protagonist returns to Iran to attend his mother's funeral, after 15 years of being away, only to be handcuffed and blindfolded and be taken away to Evin prison, to be tortured by the same torturers who had tortured his brother to death 17 years earlier.  The only difference is that this time the torturers have full beards and praying beads and recite \"In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,\" before they torture.\n\nIn 2007, after 42 years in self-imposed exile, Sholevar returned to Iran at the invitation of a group of writers and publishers.  His translations of Faulkner and T. S. Eliot had been given the reprint permits and the Persian version of his latest novel, ''Dead Reckoning'', had been submitted by a publisher to the Censors' Office (euphemistically called \"the Office of Islamic Guidance.\"Even though the program to honor him at the \"House of Art\" was banned by the authorities, the reception and welcome by the writers and the newspapers and magazines were so profuse that finally even the government's radio and television decided to join the flood of interview-seekers.\n\nHe extended his self-imposed exile in the United States indefinitely and became a citizen of the United States in 1981.  He did not visit Iran again until 2007, after 42 years of absence.  Even though his translations have been allowed republication in Iran, his original writings still are under a ban.  His last novel in Persian, titled ''Bi Lengar'', has been awaiting a publication permit for nearly two years from the Censorship office of the Islamic Republic of Iran (euphemistically called \u201cDepartment of Culture and Islamic Guidance.\u201d\n\nSholevar currently resides in Pennsylvania and writes in five languages, English, Persian, Spanish, Italian, and French.  Though most of his publications in the past forty years have been in English, or other European languages.\n\n===Major Works===\n\n====Poetry ====\n#\t''Epic of Life, Epic of Death'', ''\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0633\u06c0 \u0645\u0631\u06af \u060c \u062d\u0645\u0627\u0633\u06c0 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u064d'' (Tehran: 1960).\n#\t''Making Connection: Poems of Exile'' (Philadelphia: 1979).\n#\t\u201dAn Ode to Revolution\u201d (Satirical poem), ''Iranshahr'', vol. iii, no. 7, May 1960.\n#\t\u201dA Blood Covenant\u201d,  ''Iranshahr'', vol. iii, no. 16, July 1960.\n#\t''The Angel with Bush-Baby Eyes and other poems'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''The Love Song of Achilles and other poems'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''Odysseus' Homecoming'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''The New Adam: Poems of Renewal'' (Philadelphia: 1982)\n#\t''Rooted in Volcanic Ashes'' (Philadelphia: 1988)\n#\t''\"Four poems\"'' in North Atlantic Review: ''Writers in Exile'', no. 4, 1992.\n#\t''Il Rimpatrio d'Odysseo/ Odysseus' Homecoming'' (Italian-English) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n\n====Novel ====\n#\t''\u0633\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0628 (Safar-e-Shab) '', Khoosheh Publications, (Tehran :1976)\n#\t''The Night's Journey & the Coming of the Messiah'', No. 7 in Modern Persian Literature Series of Columbia University's Bibliotheca Persica, (Philadelphia: 1984)\n#\tExcerpts from the novel ''Dead Reckoning'', in North Atlantic Review: Writers in Exile, No 4, 1992.\n#\t''Dead Reckoning'' (English Original) (Philadelphia: 1992)\n#\t''A La Deriva'' (Spanish Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''Alla Deriva'' (Italian Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u00c0 La D\u00e9rive'' (French Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u0628\u06cc \u0644\u0646\u06af\u0631 (Bi Lengar) '' (Persian Translation) (Philadelphia: 2009)\n#\t''\u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0634\u0628 \u0648\u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a (Safar-e-Shab va Zohoor-e-Hazrat)'' (Philadelphia: 2009)\n\n====Criticism====\n#\t\u201dAbout William Faulkner and The Sound and the Fury,\u201d Translator\u2019s Preface, Tehran, 1959.\n#\t\u201dAbout T.
