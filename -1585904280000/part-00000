It mounted the [[QF 17-pounder]] anti-tank gun on a chassis derived from the [[Cromwell tank]] to add anti-tank firepower to the [[cruiser tank]] units. The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell [[chassis]] resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon and reduced armour. The extemporised 17-pounder [[Sherman Firefly]] conversion of the US-supplied Sherman was easier to produce and, with delays in production, only 200 Challengers were built. The Challenger was able to keep up with the fast Cromwell tank and was used with them.\n\n==History==\nThe driving force in the development of the Challenger was [[William Arthur Robotham]]. \"Roy\" Robotham had been a Rolls-Royce executive in the car division who, with no work to do, had led a team to develop a tank powerplant from the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] aircraft engine. The [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] gave the British a powerful, reliable engine, which was used in the A27M Cruiser Mk VIII [[Cromwell tank]]. Robotham's contributions gained him a place in the [[Ministry of Supply]] and on the Tank Board, despite his lack of experience in tank design.{{sfnp|Fletcher|1993}}\n\nThe [[General Staff]] brought forward specification A29 for a 45 ton, 17 pounder-armed cruiser tank based on needs identified in the African desert campaign. British tanks were generally underarmed compared to German vehicles. The design weight of this vehicle was subsequently seen as excessive and the specification was passed over in favour of the alternate specification, A30, which was {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} lighter.<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_cruiser_tank_A29.html ; retrieved 18 June 2016</ref> In 1942, an order for the development of an A30 based tank was placed with [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]] (BRC&W) expecting it to be based on the Cromwell components also being manufactured by BRC&W. The turret and gun mounting were in the hands of [[Stothert & Pitt]]. Birmingham Carriage had to modify the Cromwell hull to take a bigger turret.\n\nThe first prototype was ready in August 1942, only seven months after development had commenced, but proved to be very flawed.  An improved second prototype was presented in January 1943 but was still considered unacceptable.  A committee met to determine whether a requirement for a 17-pounder tank existed. The Challenger had been developed in anticipation of more heavily armoured Axis tanks, following the trend in Nazi German tank design. At roughly the same time the [[Tiger 1]] entered service with the German army, placing an immediate need for a 17-pounder armed tank in response.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}} When the second prototype was tested at [[Lulworth]], it was found that although it would be effective at long range against the current best-gunned tank in German service (the [[Panzer IV]] \"Special\" with the long {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun), at shorter ranges it would be at a disadvantage due to its slow firing rate and thin armour. The design received additional emphasis when, in May 1943, it was found in that the Cromwell could not carry its intended armament. [[Vickers]] had been developing a {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} L 50 calibre high velocity tank gun. It was realised late in the design process that the Cromwell's turret ring was too small for this gun.{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006}}{{page needed|date=June 2015}} The Challenger would be the only British cruiser tank to mount a weapon that could tackle heavier German armour until the arrival of the [[Comet tank|A34 Comet]]. Therefore already in February 1943 an order was made of two hundred vehicles.\n\nBritish tank production was constrained by limited resources and insufficient numbers could be made. This was compensated by American production. In the lead up to [[D-Day]], [[Sherman tank]]s were fitted with the 17 pounder, creating the interim 17 pounder [[Sherman Firefly]]. Converting Sherman tanks was simpler than producing Challengers, so it was decided in November 1943 to terminate the A30 production run after the two hundred vehicles had been built, allowing BRC&W to concentrate on the Cromwell. At the same time the A 40 \"Challenger Stage II\" project was cancelled, which had envisaged a 36 tonne type with heavier armour. Future design priority was concentrated on the A34 Comet, which eventually replaced the Cromwell, Firefly and Challenger. Challenger production started in March 1944. That year 145 vehicles were delivered with another 52 in 1945. Production was in two batches. A first run of forty vehicles had a 40 mm gun mantlet; with the second batch this was replaced by a 102 mm mantlet. From the hundredth vehicle onwards appliqu\u00e9 25 mm armour plates were fitted on the turret, that had already been applied to existing vehicles by field units.   \n\nThe tank was rendered obsolete when the Vickers HV 75&nbsp;mm gun was developed to become the {{nowrap|77 mm HV}} (actually 3 inch = 76.2&nbsp;mm calibre) to arm the Comet tank. The {{nowrap|77 mm HV}} used the same projectiles as the 17 pounder with a reduced propellant charge. The 17 pounder gun was reintroduced briefly on earlier marks of the Comet's successor, the [[Centurion tank]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Tanks and Afvs of the British Army 1939-45 KID906.jpg|thumb|Cruiser tank Challenger (A30)]]\nThe turret mounted the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder]] gun required in the Tank Board specification and the hull machine gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17-pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders, which raised the turret crew to four, the commander, gunner, loader 1 and loader 2. To fit the larger weapon ''and'' additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was specified, developed separately, which had a significant effect on the design and was not resolved until later development of Avenger.\n\nTo carry the weight of the 17-pounder and ammunition, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25&nbsp;mph. To limit the weight, the amount of [[Vehicle armour|armour]] was reduced but this could only be achieved on the turret, {{convert|63|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the front and {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the sides compared to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the Cromwell. The turret did not use a conventional turret ring: to increase the aperture diameter with four inches, it rested on a ball mount on the hull floor. As therefore the base of the turret was unprotected, and it would cantilever when struck by enemy rounds, a jacking feature, with four internal semi-automatic jacks, was fitted to clear jams. The additional length allowed larger hatches to be fitted in the hull while still clearing the turret, providing easier access than Cromwell.\n\n==Controversy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nUpon Robotham's appointment as Chief Engineer to the Department of Tank Design, the lack of progress on an (A29) 17-pounder armed tank could not adequately be explained. Robotham's memoirs indicate a lack of awareness that any such requirement existed within the department and military users were still unsure whether the tank was required at the point when the rushed A30 design had been completed and prototype vehicles run.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970|p=165}} The Challenger was then rushed into production alongside existing production runs of Cromwell, limiting the number of tanks that could be produced.\n\nThe dubious reliability of earlier British tank designs, along with limited manufacturing capacity, led to a joint mission to the US to explore US tank options and share design experiences learned from action. Consequently, British and other Commonwealth forces introduced a much larger contingent of US-made vehicles, each using dual purpose 75 mm guns with reduced anti-armour capability (US doctrine placed artillery as the primary anti-tank weapon, while tanks used the dual-purpose gun to fire high-explosive shells at un-armoured targets).\n\nCromwells carrying the 6-pounder had been delayed in design and the move to cancel Challenger while switching Cromwell to the dual purpose 75 mm gun (with a corresponding drop in anti-armour performance) left British and other Commonwealth forces without a main-force tank weapon capable of taking on the equivalent generation of Axis tanks. The lack of firepower was keenly felt by tank crews fighting heavier armed and sometimes more heavily armoured, Axis tanks. The Firefly was used as a stop-gap, which was only resolved, much later, with the A34 Comet. While Comet improved significantly upon both Cromwell and Challenger designs, its design and production followed that of the Cromwell and was delayed much longer than an equivalent production (and evolution) of Challenger.\n\n==Performance==\nThe 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the [[Tiger I]] and [[Panther tank]] and had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the [[Panzer IV]] or [[StuG III]]. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.\n\nIn combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.\n\nThe Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the [[Crusader tank]]. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field.<ref>Track Throwing, 15.11.44; Rm/GB.5/SW.15.11.44</ref> Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.\n\nIn comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly's constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10{{formatnum:}}\u00b0 of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5{{formatnum:}}\u00b0, which was significant disadvantage in combat.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}} It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification, the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults, such as the D-day landings.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11374.jpg|thumb|A Challenger tank crosses a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Dommel river in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint-Michielsgestel, the Netherlands]]. 27 October 1944.]]\nNo provision was made for [[deep wading]], before the design went into production; as a result, the A30 could not be landed in the initial phase of the [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of Normandy]]. Challenger crews had to wait until July 1944, when [[Mulberry harbour]]s were operational and ports had been captured.\n\nThe Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], with about sixteen vehicles in each unit. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown.<ref>Note from Service Engineer, 15.11.44; AA.2/JB.11.11.44</ref> The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.\n\nConfidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others.<ref>The Rolls Royce Meteor - Cromwell and other applications; Historical Series No. 35 published by the Rolls Royce Heritage Trust</ref> Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the [[1st Polish Armoured Division]] receiving several in mid-1945 and the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]] used it during the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1944\u201345)|siege of Dunkirk in late 1944.]]<ref>Hayward ''The Other Challenger'' quoting Six Monthly RAC Progress Reports</ref>{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006|p=47}} After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.<ref>{{cite book |last= Francev|first= Vladim\u00edr|title=\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 tankov\u00e9 s\u00edly 1945-1992 |year=2012 |publisher=Grada |location=Prague |isbn=9788024740294 |page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n'''A30 Avenger SP2''' or '''SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger)''' was a development of Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader's position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}<!-- note that the open top without cover is the prototype - please don't confuse this with a production vehicle -->\n\nAs many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its production with the [[Valentine Archer]] (SP1) and [[Alecto (SPG)|Alecto]] (SP3).{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to run the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when Avenger's steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of Achilles, its US derived equivalent.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nWhile the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful as a self-propelled artillery piece, in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an interesting example of what could have been possible for the Challenger tank had it not been forced to accommodate the second loader and larger turret during the tank design. This is highlighted in Robotham's memoirs, indicating that it may have been corrected had design effort not moved to the Comet.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}\n\n==Survivors==\n[[File:A30 Challenger pic2.JPG|thumb|A30 Challenger, [[Overloon War Museum]]]]\nTwo vehicles survive, one at the [[Overloon War Museum]] in the Netherlands, acquired from the [[Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl]] in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure.

It mounted the [[QF 17-pounder]] anti-tank gun on a chassis derived from the [[Cromwell tank]] to add anti-tank firepower to the [[cruiser tank]] units. The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell [[chassis]] resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon and reduced armour.

While Comet improved significantly upon both Cromwell and Challenger designs, its design and production followed that of the Cromwell and was delayed much longer than an equivalent production (and evolution) of Challenger.\n\n==Performance==\nThe 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the [[Tiger I]] and [[Panther tank]] and had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the [[Panzer IV]] or [[StuG III]]. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.\n\nIn combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.\n\nThe Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the [[Crusader tank]]. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field.<ref>Track Throwing, 15.11.44; Rm/GB.5/SW.15.11.44</ref> Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.\n\nIn comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly's constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10{{formatnum:}}\u00b0 of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5{{formatnum:}}\u00b0, which was significant disadvantage in combat.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}} It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification, the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults, such as the D-day landings.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11374.jpg|thumb|A Challenger tank crosses a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Dommel river in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint-Michielsgestel, the Netherlands]]. 27 October 1944]]\nThe vehicle entered front-line service in July 1944 during the Allied invasion of Normandy but no provision had been made for [[deep wading]] trunking and the A30 was unable to participate in the landings; Challenger crews had to wait until the [[Mulberry harbour]]s were built and ports captured. The Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], with about sixteen vehicles in each unit. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown.<ref>Note from Service Engineer, 15.11.44; AA.2/JB.11.11.44</ref> The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.\n\nConfidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others.<ref>The Rolls Royce Meteor - Cromwell and other applications; Historical Series No. 35 published by the Rolls Royce Heritage Trust</ref> Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the [[1st Polish Armoured Division]] receiving several in mid-1945 and the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]] used it during the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1944\u201345)|siege of Dunkirk in late 1944.]]<ref>Hayward ''The Other Challenger'' quoting Six Monthly RAC Progress Reports</ref>{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006|p=47}} After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.<ref>{{cite book |last= Francev|first= Vladim\u00edr|title=\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 tankov\u00e9 s\u00edly 1945-1992 |year=2012 |publisher=Grada |location=Prague |isbn=9788024740294 |page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n'''A30 Avenger SP2''' or '''SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger)''' was a development of Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader's position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}<!-- note that the open top without cover is the prototype - please don't confuse this with a production vehicle -->\n\nAs many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its production with the [[Valentine Archer]] (SP1) and [[Alecto (SPG)|Alecto]] (SP3).{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to run the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when Avenger's steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of Achilles, its US derived equivalent.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nWhile the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful as a self-propelled artillery piece, in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an interesting example of what could have been possible for the Challenger tank had it not been forced to accommodate the second loader and larger turret during the tank design. This is highlighted in Robotham's memoirs, indicating that it may have been corrected had design effort not moved to the Comet.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}\n\n==Survivors==\n[[File:A30 Challenger pic2.JPG|thumb|A30 Challenger, [[Overloon War Museum]]]]\nTwo vehicles survive, one at the [[Overloon War Museum]] in the Netherlands, acquired from the [[Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl]] in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure.

The bedroom included eight narrowly shaped double beds as well as a walk-in wardrobe for housemates to store their belongings. In the garden, the Treehouse was replaced by a spiral staircase leading to a \"[[Gogglebox]]\" pod where housemates could spy on each other. The garden also featured a large circular pool and a smoking area. Geometric heads were a common theme within the house as they served as ornaments, containers and planters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0602/big-brother-2014-power-trip-new-look-house-revealed-picture-gallery|title=Big Brother 2014: Power Trip house revealed|publisher=bbspy|date=|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nA new addition to the House in the series was the Control Room, which was used as part of the series' Power theme. The Housemate who was equipped with the Power was able to access the Control Room and view various information about the other Housemates, such as their VTs, Diary Room entries and public opinions of them, in order to inform their decisions as the Power Housemate. The Control Room was occupied by a computerised female voice known as Iris, who communicated with the Power Housemate and talked them through their options.\n\n===Teasers===\nOn 9 May 2014, Channel 5 released the first 10-second teaser for the new series hinting at the \"Power\" theme and also featured the new eye logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0509/first-big-brother-2014-teaser-advert-hints-at-power-theme-watch-video|title=First Big Brother 2014 advert hints at 'power' theme|last=Scott|first=Matt|date=9 May 2014|publisher=bbspy|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 16 May 2014, a second teaser was released confirming the new title for the series \u2013 ''Big Brother: Power Trip''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0516/second-big-brother-power-trip-teaser-advert-airs-channel-5|title=New Big Brother: Power Trip teaser advert airs|last=Scott|first=Matt|date=16 May 2014|publisher=bbspy|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> A minute-long trailer confirming the new series title was revealed on 22 May 2014.

They refused, therefore no more money was added. The next chance to add to the prize fund was given to the housemates that did not receive their letters from home; Chris, Christopher and Mark as they were to be told they can spend time with one of their family members.

However, the housemates then banked a further \u00a35,000 by unlocking a vault by identifying what housemates said about them from the quotes read out to them. The public then voted for who they thought was the best judge of character. They chose Ashleigh. For the last part of the ''Power of Money'' twist, all housemates except Ashleigh were told they had been selected by the public to face a dilemma: take the banked \u00a315,500 for themselves, or leave it for the winner. However this was a lie, but Ash, Chris and Mark all said they would take the money. Ashleigh's role in the task was then revealed as she had to predict the three housemates who said they would take it. As she failed the predict all three, she failed the task and lost the extra money meaning the prize fund stayed at \u00a3100,000.<ref name=\"bbspy9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0806/ashleigh-coyle-loses-25k-power-of-money-bonus-ash-chris-mark-take-money-big-brother-2014 |title=Ashleigh loses \u00a325k prize fund bonus in task conclusion \u2013 Big Brother 2014: Power Trip UK Channel 5 News |publisher=bbspy |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 68, in the ''Power of Knowledge'', the Power returned for the final time, this time to Ash and Christopher.

A typical week began with nominations, followed by the shopping task, and then the eviction of a housemate during the live Friday episode. Evictions, tasks, and other events for a particular week are noted in order of sequence.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 96%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=5 style=\"width: 6%;\" | Week 1\n| '''Tasks''' ||\n* On Day 3, housemates participated in the 'Crack the Category' task in order to win luxury ingredients for dinner that night. ''Power Housemate'' Pauline chose Christopher as 'most perceptive' Housemate and together they sat in the Diary Room while the other Housemates ranked themselves from most to least in various different categories such as fake, manipulative or obnoxious. Pauline and Christopher then had to guess from three choices what category the Housemates were ranking on. Pauline and Christopher correctly guessed four out of six categories, and therefore, passed the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0608/big-brother-2014-seven-housemates-get-suitcases-first-task-passed |title=Seven housemates get suitcases, first task passed |publisher=bbspy |date=8 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 4, the housemates without their suitcases had a chance to win them back by competing in a task. Chris and Ashleigh went head-to-head to see who was the most weird, Jale and Kimberly had to settle who was the most sexy, whilst Tamara and Toya, Ash and Marlon attempted to be most disgusting. The remaining housemates voted as to which housemate was best in the categories and chose Chris, Jale, Tamara and Toya to receive their suitcases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s149/big-brother/news/a576497/big-brother-housemates-battle-to-be-weirdest-grossest-in-new-task.html |title=Big Brother: Housemates battle to be weirdest, grossest in new task \u2013 Big Brother News \u2013 Reality TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=9 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Days 6 and 7, housemates took part in their first shopping task of the series, entitled 'Power of Positivity'. Over these two days, housemates had to remain positive throughout the entire challenge, with any display of negativity incurring a fail. To make things more difficult, Big Brother set up mini-challenges (such as drinking disgusting 'cocktail' drinks) and banned certain products (such as cigarettes and beauty products) to make the task more difficult to complete. Housemates incurred 5 out of a maximum 10 fails, and therefore passed the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0612/big-brother-2014-housemates-pass-power-of-positivity-shopping-task |title=Housemates pass 'Power of Positivity' shopping task |publisher=bbspy |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 9, after claiming he was psychic, Mark's claims were put to the test as he had to predict the future in the house and answer questions from three housemates; Helen, Danielle and Winston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s149/big-brother/news/a577715/big-brother-mark-gets-mystical-in-latest-task.html |title=Big Brother: Mark gets mystical in latest task \u2013 Big Brother News \u2013 Reality TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''Twists''' ||\n* On Day 1, after the housemates entered, Pauline was voted as the ''Power Housemate'' by the public. She then had to enter the Control Room to make a decision. She was shown all the housemate's VTs and based on her impressions she had to reward a housemate and punish one. She chose to reward Mark and punish Matthew. As a result, Mark was given \u00a35,000 and Matthew spent the first night in a box above the garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0605/big-brother-2014-launch-twist-pauline-first-power-trip-housemate-mark-5k-reward-matthew-punishment |title=Pauline becomes power housemate, Mark wins \u00a35k \u2013 News |publisher=bbspy |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 2, after the final six housemates entered, Pauline had to decide which housemate would win a free pass to the Final, granting them immunity from every single eviction.

Despite not being able to be nominated, in some cases, ''Power Housemates'' could face the public vote and be evicted, see [[#endnote 4|note 4]] & [[#endnote 8|note 8]].\n* {{Note|2|Note 2}}: On Day 2, ''Power Housemate'' Pauline granted Helen a pass to the final, granting her immunity from every eviction of the series and therefore could not be nominated by her fellow housemates. On Day 4, as housemates nominated for the first time, Pauline was told she\u2019d make one ''Killer Nomination'' and that whoever she chose would automatically face every eviction of the series until they were evicted. Pauline decided to give the ''Killer Nomination'' to Jale, meaning she also could not be nominated by her fellow housemates in following weeks.\n* {{Note|3|Note 3}}: On Day 9, Big Brother announced that this week's nominations were cancelled and only the secret ''Power Housemate'', Chris, was eligible to nominate. Chris nominated Pauline and Christopher on Day 9, Steven on Day 10, Ash on Day 11, and Marlon on Day 12. On Day 15, Big Brother announced that Housemates would be choosing the next ''Power Housemate''. All Housemates were eligible to receive the power except for those who were currently facing the public vote.\n* {{Note|4|Note 4}}: Toya was voted the ''Power Housemate'' by the group on Day 16, and she chose Matthew to join her in forming the ''Power Couple''. Together they picked Christopher to automatically face the third eviction. All other housemates later nominated as normal, but before they did, Toya and Matthew had the chance to cancel three housemates\u2019 nominations. They chose Ash, Marlon and Steven. Had this not happened Kimberly would have also faced the public vote. On Day 18, Toya and Matthew were able to save one of the nominees (excluding Christopher and Jale). They chose Steven, who in return had to put either Toya or Matthew up for eviction. He chose Toya.\n* {{Note|5|Note 5}}: After Toya's eviction, Big Brother announced ''Girl Power'', with the female housemates getting control of the house and immunity for the week. As a result of this, Jale was given a one-week reprieve from her ''Killer Nomination'' and all male housemates were automatically put up for eviction. Before the lines opened, the girls were allowed to save three of the boys. They saved Chris, Marlon and Steven.\n* {{Note|6|Note 6}}: Marlon was originally nominated alongside Ashleigh, Chris, Christopher and Jale, however he won safety in the Battery Power shopping task meaning he no longer faced eviction.\n* {{Note|7|Note 7}}: On Day 39, housemates nominated as normal, unaware that as part of \"Armageddon Week\" the housemate who received the most nominations would be instantly evicted the next day. Marlon received the most nominations (7 out of a possible 10 nominations) and was therefore evicted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0711/big-brother-2014-armageddon-twist-eviction-without-public-vote-controversy-viewers |title=Confirmed: No public vote for next Big Brother eviction \u2013 Big Brother 2014: Power Trip UK Channel 5 News |publisher=bbspy |date= |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* {{Note|8|Note 8}}: Unbeknownst to them, new housemates Biannca, Pav and Zoe all faced the public vote this week. Unlike previous weeks, this week was a vote to save.\n* {{Note|9|Note 9}}: After Marlon's eviction, Big Brother told the rest of the housemates that they all faced the public vote this week. In reality, Big Brother handed the power to the new housemates, who had to decide whom to evict. As Helen had a free pass to the final, she could not be chosen. Kimberly also could not be chosen as she temporarily left the house on Day 44 due to an illness. Following Biannca's eviction, Pav and Zoe had 30 seconds to decide who to evict, and they unanimously decided to evict Danielle.\n* {{Note|10|Note 10}}: On Day 46, Ashleigh was chosen by the public to become the next ''Power Housemate''. On Day 47, she chose Chris to join her in forming a ''Power Alliance''. Together they decided to nominate Steven and selected Mark to join the Alliance, which then nominated Ash. On Day 48, the ''Power Alliance'' nominated Pav and Zoe. In a further twist, the nominated housemates were told to decide between them which of them should be saved from eviction and which of the ''Power Alliance'' to replace themselves with. The nominated housemates decided to save Ash from eviction and replaced him with Ashleigh.\n* {{Note|11|Note 11}}: On Day 51, the power was given to the public. Via the Big Brother app, the public voted for Ashleigh to be immune from eviction this week and therefore, she could not be nominated.\n* {{Note|12|Note 12}}: On Day 61, housemates nominated face-to-face. On Day 62, as part of Big Brother's \"Power of Money\" scheme, the remaining housemates eligible to face the public vote (Ash, Ashleigh and Chris) each chose an envelope: one containing \u00a31,000, another containing \u00a35,000, and the final containing \u00a310,000. The already nominated housemates had to choose one of the remaining housemates to join them in facing eviction, with the amount in their envelope supposedly added to the prize fund. They chose Chris, and \u00a310,000 was added to the fund (although all the money won in the ''Power of Money'' was not put in the prize fund as Ashleigh failed a task).\n* {{Note|13|Note 13}}: This week the public voted to win, rather than to evict. Whilst the public were voting to win, Helen and Chris were fake evicted on Day 68 and moved into the 'Spare Room', but they were still eligible to win. They returned to the house the following day.\n</small>\n\n==Ratings and reception==\n\n===Television ratings===\nOfficial ratings are taken from [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] and include +1, but not +24.<ref>{{cite web|title=BARB \u2013 Weekly Top 30 Programmes|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?_s=4|accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12%;\"|\n! scope=col colspan=13| Viewers (millions)\n|-\n! colspan=2| Week 1\n!

Despite this, on Day 48 the ''Power Alliance'' twist came to an end with Ashleigh being put up for eviction. Big Brother fans responded furiously to the news, accusing show bosses of lying and misleading both the housemates and the public. However, the broadcaster declined the opportunity to explain the twist, instead answering simply: \"No comment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0723/exclusive-big-brother-2014-channel-5-refuses-to-comment-on-ashleigh-coyle-immunity-nomination-scandal |title=Exclusive: C5 refuses to comment on immunity scandal \u2013 BBSpy |publisher=Bbspy.co.uk |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nShortly after his eviction, ex-housemate Steven Goode criticised the show for unhygienic living conditions within the house, complaining of food and dirty clothes being left lying around, and a general bad smell in the house.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Huffington Post UK |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/29/big-brother-house-dirty-illness-kimberly_n_5630060.html |title='Big Brother' House 'Could Shut For Health And Safety Reasons' After Housemates Fall Ill...

Similar to the previous series, the Diary Room was at the top of the stairs. However the layout for the house remained almost identical to ''[[Big Brother 14 (UK)|Big Brother 14]]'', except for the bedroom, which was located where the Safe House was, and the bathroom, which replaced the bedroom. The bedroom included eight narrowly shaped double beds as well as a walk-in wardrobe for housemates to store their belongings. In the garden, the Treehouse was replaced by a spiral staircase leading to a \"[[Gogglebox]]\" pod where housemates could spy on each other. The garden also featured a large circular pool and a smoking area. Geometric heads were a common theme within the house as they served as ornaments, containers and planters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0602/big-brother-2014-power-trip-new-look-house-revealed-picture-gallery|title=Big Brother 2014: Power Trip house revealed|publisher=bbspy|date=|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nA new addition to the House in the series was the Control Room, which was used as part of the series' Power theme. The Housemate who was equipped with the Power was able to access the Control Room and view various information about the other Housemates, such as their VTs, Diary Room entries and public opinions of them, in order to inform their decisions as the Power Housemate. The Control Room was occupied by a computerised female voice known as Iris, who communicated with the Power Housemate and talked them through their options.\n\n===Teasers===\nOn 9 May 2014, Channel 5 released the first 10-second teaser for the new series hinting at the \"Power\" theme and also featured the new eye logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0509/first-big-brother-2014-teaser-advert-hints-at-power-theme-watch-video|title=First Big Brother 2014 advert hints at 'power' theme|last=Scott|first=Matt|date=9 May 2014|publisher=bbspy|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 16 May 2014, a second teaser was released confirming the new title for the series - ''Big Brother: Power Trip''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0516/second-big-brother-power-trip-teaser-advert-airs-channel-5|title=New Big Brother: Power Trip teaser advert airs|last=Scott|first=Matt|date=16 May 2014|publisher=bbspy|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> A minute-long trailer confirming the new series title was revealed on 22 May 2014.

They refused, therefore no more money was added. The next chance to add to the prize fund was given to the housemates that did not receive their letters from home; Chris, Christopher and Mark as they were to be told they can spend time with one of their family members.

However, the housemates then banked a further \u00a35,000 by unlocking a vault by identifying what housemates said about them from the quotes read out to them. The public then voted for who they thought was the best judge of character. They chose Ashleigh. For the last part of the ''Power of Money'' twist, all housemates except Ashleigh were told they had been selected by the public to face a dilemma: take the banked \u00a315,500 for themselves, or leave it for the winner. However this was a lie, but Ash, Chris and Mark all said they would take the money. Ashleigh's role in the task was then revealed as she had to predict the three housemates who said they would take it. As she failed the predict all three, she failed the task and lost the extra money meaning the prize fund stayed at \u00a3100,000.<ref name=\"bbspy9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0806/ashleigh-coyle-loses-25k-power-of-money-bonus-ash-chris-mark-take-money-big-brother-2014 |title=Ashleigh loses \u00a325k prize fund bonus in task conclusion - Big Brother 2014: Power Trip UK Channel 5 News |publisher=bbspy |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 68, in the ''Power of Knowledge'', the Power returned for the final time, this time to Ash and Christopher.

A typical week began with nominations, followed by the shopping task, and then the eviction of a housemate during the live Friday episode. Evictions, tasks, and other events for a particular week are noted in order of sequence.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 96%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=5 style=\"width: 6%;\" | Week 1\n| '''Tasks''' ||\n* On Day 3, housemates participated in the 'Crack the Category' task in order to win luxury ingredients for dinner that night. ''Power Housemate'' Pauline chose Christopher as 'most perceptive' Housemate and together they sat in the Diary Room while the other Housemates ranked themselves from most to least in various different categories such as fake, manipulative or obnoxious. Pauline and Christopher then had to guess from three choices what category the Housemates were ranking on. Pauline and Christopher correctly guessed four out of six categories, and therefore, passed the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0608/big-brother-2014-seven-housemates-get-suitcases-first-task-passed |title=Seven housemates get suitcases, first task passed |publisher=bbspy |date=8 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 4, the housemates without their suitcases had a chance to win them back by competing in a task. Chris and Ashleigh went head-to-head to see who was the most weird, Jale and Kimberly had to settle who was the most sexy, whilst Tamara and Toya, Ash and Marlon attempted to be most disgusting. The remaining housemates voted as to which housemate was best in the categories and chose Chris, Jale, Tamara and Toya to receive their suitcases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s149/big-brother/news/a576497/big-brother-housemates-battle-to-be-weirdest-grossest-in-new-task.html |title=Big Brother: Housemates battle to be weirdest, grossest in new task - Big Brother News - Reality TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=9 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Days 6 and 7, housemates took part in their first shopping task of the series, entitled 'Power of Positivity'. Over these two days, housemates had to remain positive throughout the entire challenge, with any display of negativity incurring a fail. To make things more difficult, Big Brother set up mini-challenges (such as drinking disgusting 'cocktail' drinks) and banned certain products (such as cigarettes and beauty products) to make the task more difficult to complete. Housemates incurred 5 out of a maximum 10 fails, and therefore passed the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0612/big-brother-2014-housemates-pass-power-of-positivity-shopping-task |title=Housemates pass 'Power of Positivity' shopping task |publisher=bbspy |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n* On Day 9, after claiming he was psychic, Mark's claims were put to the test as he had to predict the future in the house and answer questions from three housemates; Helen, Danielle and Winston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s149/big-brother/news/a577715/big-brother-mark-gets-mystical-in-latest-task.html |title=Big Brother: Mark gets mystical in latest task - Big Brother News - Reality TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''Twists''' ||\n* On Day 1, after the housemates entered, Pauline was voted as the ''Power Housemate'' by the public.

Despite not being able to be nominated, in some cases, ''Power Housemates'' could face the public vote and be evicted, see [[#endnote 4|note 4]] & [[#endnote 8|note 8]].\n* {{Note|2|Note 2}}: On Day 2, ''Power Housemate'' Pauline granted Helen a pass to the final, granting her immunity from every eviction of the series and therefore could not be nominated by her fellow housemates. On Day 4, as housemates nominated for the first time, Pauline was told she\u2019d make one ''Killer Nomination'' and that whoever she chose would automatically face every eviction of the series until they were evicted. Pauline decided to give the ''Killer Nomination'' to Jale, meaning she also could not be nominated by her fellow housemates in following weeks.\n* {{Note|3|Note 3}}: On Day 9, Big Brother announced that this week's nominations were cancelled and only the secret ''Power Housemate'', Chris, was eligible to nominate. Chris nominated Pauline and Christopher on Day 9, Steven on Day 10, Ash on Day 11, and Marlon on Day 12. On Day 15, Big Brother announced that Housemates would be choosing the next ''Power Housemate''. All Housemates were eligible to receive the power except for those who were currently facing the public vote.\n* {{Note|4|Note 4}}: Toya was voted the ''Power Housemate'' by the group on Day 16, and she chose Matthew to join her in forming the ''Power Couple''. Together they picked Christopher to automatically face the third eviction. All other housemates later nominated as normal, but before they did, Toya and Matthew had the chance to cancel three housemates\u2019 nominations. They chose Ash, Marlon and Steven. Had this not happened Kimberly would have also faced the public vote. On Day 18, Toya and Matthew were able to save one of the nominees (excluding Christopher and Jale). They chose Steven, who in return had to put either Toya or Matthew up for eviction. He chose Toya.\n* {{Note|5|Note 5}}: After Toya's eviction, Big Brother announced ''Girl Power'', with the female housemates getting control of the house and immunity for the week. As a result of this, Jale was given a one-week reprieve from her ''Killer Nomination'' and all male housemates were automatically put up for eviction. Before the lines opened, the girls were allowed to save three of the boys. They saved Chris, Marlon and Steven.\n* {{Note|6|Note 6}}: Marlon was originally nominated alongside Ashleigh, Chris, Christopher and Jale, however he won safety in the Battery Power shopping task meaning he no longer faced eviction.\n* {{Note|7|Note 7}}: On Day 39, housemates nominated as normal, unaware that as part of \"Armageddon Week\" the housemate who received the most nominations would be instantly evicted the next day. Marlon received the most nominations (7 out of a possible 10 nominations) and was therefore evicted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0711/big-brother-2014-armageddon-twist-eviction-without-public-vote-controversy-viewers |title=Confirmed: No public vote for next Big Brother eviction - Big Brother 2014: Power Trip UK Channel 5 News |publisher=bbspy |date= |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* {{Note|8|Note 8}}: Unbeknownst to them, new housemates Biannca, Pav and Zoe all faced the public vote this week. Unlike previous weeks, this week was a vote to save.\n* {{Note|9|Note 9}}: After Marlon's eviction, Big Brother told the rest of the housemates that they all faced the public vote this week. In reality, Big Brother handed the power to the new housemates, who had to decide whom to evict. As Helen had a free pass to the final, she could not be chosen. Kimberly also could not be chosen as she temporarily left the house on Day 44 due to an illness. Following Biannca's eviction, Pav and Zoe had 30 seconds to decide who to evict, and they unanimously decided to evict Danielle.\n* {{Note|10|Note 10}}: On Day 46, Ashleigh was chosen by the public to become the next ''Power Housemate''. On Day 47, she chose Chris to join her in forming a ''Power Alliance''. Together they decided to nominate Steven and selected Mark to join the Alliance, which then nominated Ash. On Day 48, the ''Power Alliance'' nominated Pav and Zoe. In a further twist, the nominated housemates were told to decide between them which of them should be saved from eviction and which of the ''Power Alliance'' to replace themselves with. The nominated housemates decided to save Ash from eviction and replaced him with Ashleigh.\n* {{Note|11|Note 11}}: On Day 51, the power was given to the public. Via the Big Brother app, the public voted for Ashleigh to be immune from eviction this week and therefore, she could not be nominated.\n* {{Note|12|Note 12}}: On Day 61, housemates nominated face-to-face. On Day 62, as part of Big Brother's \"Power of Money\" scheme, the remaining housemates eligible to face the public vote (Ash, Ashleigh and Chris) each chose an envelope: one containing \u00a31,000, another containing \u00a35,000, and the final containing \u00a310,000. The already nominated housemates had to choose one of the remaining housemates to join them in facing eviction, with the amount in their envelope supposedly added to the prize fund. They chose Chris, and \u00a310,000 was added to the fund (although all the money won in the ''Power of Money'' was not put in the prize fund as Ashleigh failed a task).\n* {{Note|13|Note 13}}: This week the public voted to win, rather than to evict. Whilst the public were voting to win, Helen and Chris were fake evicted on Day 68 and moved into the 'Spare Room', but they were still eligible to win. They returned to the house the following day.\n</small>\n\n==Ratings and reception==\n\n===Television ratings===\nOfficial ratings are taken from [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] and include +1, but not +24.<ref>{{cite web|title=BARB - Weekly Top 30 Programmes|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?_s=4|accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12%;\"|\n! scope=col colspan=13| Viewers (millions)\n|-\n! colspan=2| Week 1\n!

After she joined forces with Chris and Mark to become the ''Power Alliance'', which would exclusively decide who would face eviction, Channel 5 announced to the public that all members of the ''Power Alliance'' would be immune from eviction. Despite this, on Day 48 the ''Power Alliance'' twist came to an end with Ashleigh being put up for eviction. Big Brother fans responded furiously to the news, accusing show bosses of lying and misleading both the housemates and the public. However, the broadcaster declined the opportunity to explain the twist, instead answering simply: \"No comment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb15/news/0723/exclusive-big-brother-2014-channel-5-refuses-to-comment-on-ashleigh-coyle-immunity-nomination-scandal |title=Exclusive: C5 refuses to comment on immunity scandal - BBSpy |publisher=Bbspy.co.uk |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nShortly after his eviction, ex-housemate Steven Goode criticised the show for unhygienic living conditions within the house, complaining of food and dirty clothes being left lying around, and a general bad smell in the house.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Huffington Post UK |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/29/big-brother-house-dirty-illness-kimberly_n_5630060.html |title='Big Brother' House 'Could Shut For Health And Safety Reasons' After Housemates Fall Ill...
