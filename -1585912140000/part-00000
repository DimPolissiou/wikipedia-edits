Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]], where he established his own laboratory and research.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately, Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].<ref name=\"Schultz\" />\n\n===Historical misconceptions===\nAmerican [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\">{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634\u2013654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}</ref><ref name=\"Clegg 2013\">{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}</ref> is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology, privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article \"[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']\", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.<ref name=\"Clegg 2013\"/> It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.\n\n===Recent developments===\n{{See also|Introspection illusion}}\nPartly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /><ref>{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the \"[[think aloud protocol]]\", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S.

[[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Sch\u00fctz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere \"inner sensation\", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.<ref>Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.</ref> Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. \nRecent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment.

Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.\n\nAnother question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.\nThat is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371\u2013372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}</ref>\n\nEven when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being \"unaware of their unawareness\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046\u20131047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}</ref> This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37\u201343|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}</ref> and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.<ref name=\"selfismagic\">{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately, Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].<ref name=\"Schultz\" />\n\n===Historical misconceptions===\nAmerican [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\">{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634\u2013654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}</ref><ref name=\"Clegg 2013\">{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}</ref> is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology, privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article \"[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']\", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.<ref name=\"Clegg 2013\"/> It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.\n\n===Recent developments===\n{{See also|Introspection illusion}}\nPartly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /><ref>{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the \"[[think aloud protocol]]\", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S.

[[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Sch\u00fctz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere \"inner sensation\", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.<ref>Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.</ref> Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. \nRecent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly [[confabulation|confabulated]].<ref name=\"telling\">{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D.

Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.\n\nAnother question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.\nThat is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371\u2013372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}</ref>\n\nEven when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being \"unaware of their unawareness\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046\u20131047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}</ref> This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37\u201343|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}</ref> and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.<ref name=\"selfismagic\">{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

While searching for the embezzler, they fall in love with each other.\n\nAfter the failure of her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'', Madonna decided to sign up for another comedy film titled ''Slammer'', which was later renamed ''Who's That Girl''. However, she had to convince both Warner Bros. and the producers of the film that she was ready for the project. Madonna enlisted her friend James Foley to direct the film. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall in New York. Madonna utilized the time to work on her next tour and the soundtrack of the film.\n\nThe film was released on August 7, 1987, and  was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only  $2.5&nbsp;million in its first week, with its final domestic total being about $7.3&nbsp;million on a budget between $17 million and $20 million. Critics were highly disappointed with the film, and Foley's direction. Madonna's accompanying [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] went on to be a critical and commercial success, grossing a total of US$25&nbsp;million, and playing in front of audiences totaling 1.5&nbsp;million people. The [[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] also enjoyed commercial success, with the [[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|title track]] becoming Madonna's sixth number one single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] record chart.\n\n==Plot==\nNikki Finn is a carefree young woman who usually wears a leather jacket and skirt, sports fire-red lips and a platinum bob, and speaks in a high-pitched voice; she's also resourceful and intelligent. One day her boyfriend Johnny sees two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes a picture of this theft. He puts the pictures in a [[safe deposit box]] and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch and murder Johnny and frame Nikki by dumping his body into the trunk of her car, and she's sentenced to seven years in prison. \n\nAfter four years, tax attorney Loudon Trott ([[Griffin Dunne]]) is marrying the daughter of one of the richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington ([[Haviland Morris]]) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in her fianc\u00e9's well-being. Loudon, on the other hand, has many duties entrusted to him by his boss--and future father-in-law--Mr. Worthington ([[John McMartin]]): First he must pick up a [[cougar]] for an exotic-animal activist Montgomery Bell ([[John Mills]]), then he must pick up Nikki, and lastly he must make sure she catches the next bus to her hometown, Philadelphia.  \n\nMeanwhile, Nikki's determined to catch the actual thieves and expose the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After they take a Rolls-Royce into Harlem to buy a gun--and are nearly arrested during a police raid--she tells Loudon her story; believing she's innocent, he decides to help her. She's also on the run from a [[pimp]] named Raoul ([[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]]) and his lackey Benny ([[Dennis Burkley]]), the ones who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage does he tell her the bank and the box number (6111) of her slain boyfriend.\n\nAfterward Nikki vanishes with the cougar, whom she names Murray. Loudon visits Mr. Bell to apologize for losing the animal, then finds that Nikki had delivered Murray and was waiting for Loudon at Mr. Bell's home; he has created a [[Amazon rainforest|Brazilian rainforest]] filled with animals on top of his roof. There Nikki and Loudon--who have become close--express love for each other; Murray also finds a mate. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki brokenheartedly realizes that she must go back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. On the bus she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an [[embezzlement|embezzler]] and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki [[Gate-crashing|gate-crashes]] the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested, and proclaims her love for Loudon. Nikki and Loudon ride off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as Nikki Finn\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Loudon Trott\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Wendy Worthington\n* [[John McMartin]] as Simon Worthington\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Ms. Worthington\n* [[John Mills]] as Montgomery Bell\n* Robert Swan as Detective Bellson\n* Drew Pillsbury as Detective Doyle\n* [[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]] as Raoul\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=I was young, I was twenty-eight.

Following the commercially successful ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'', her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]''\u2014where she starred with her then husband [[Sean Penn]]\u2014was a critical and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she \"struggled to come to terms with her character in ''Shanghai Surprise'', because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance with my own character.\"<ref name=\"morton1\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=189}}</ref> Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less sure about backing her up.<ref name=\"morton1\"/>\n\nMadonna felt that comedy was more of her repertoire, and proceeded to sign a comedy film titled ''Slammer'', written by Andrew Smith and [[Ken Finkleman]].

It stars [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Griffin Dunne]], and depicts the story of a street-smart girl who is falsely accused of murdering her boyfriend and is sent to jail. After being released, she meets a man, who is supposed to make sure she gets on her bus back to Philadelphia, and convinces him to help her catch those responsible for her confinement. While searching for the embezzler, they fall in love with each other.\n\nAfter the failure of her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'', Madonna decided to sign up for another comedy film titled ''Slammer'', which was later renamed ''Who's That Girl''. However, she had to convince both Warner Bros. and the producers of the film that she was ready for the project. Madonna enlisted her friend James Foley to direct the film. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall in New York. Madonna utilized the time to work on her next tour and the soundtrack of the film.\n\nThe film was released on August 7, 1987, and  was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only  $2.5&nbsp;million in its first week, with its final domestic total being about $7.3&nbsp;million on a budget between $17 million and $20 million. Critics were highly disappointed with the film, and Foley's direction. Madonna's accompanying [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] went on to be a critical and commercial success, grossing a total of US$25&nbsp;million, and playing in front of audiences totaling 1.5&nbsp;million people. The [[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] also enjoyed commercial success, with the [[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|title track]] becoming Madonna's sixth number one single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] record chart.\n\n==Plot==\nNikki Finn is a carefree young woman who usually wears a leather jacket and skirt, sports fire-red lips and a platinum bob, and speaks in a high-pitched voice; she's also resourceful and intelligent. One day her boyfriend Johnny sees two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes a picture of this theft. He puts the pictures in a [[safe deposit box]] and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch and murder Johnny and frame Nikki by dumping his body into the trunk of her car, and she's sentenced to seven years in prison. \n\nAfter four years, tax attorney Loudon Trott ([[Griffin Dunne]]) is marrying the daughter of one of the richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington ([[Haviland Morris]]) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in her fianc\u00e9's well-being. Loudon, on the other hand, has many duties entrusted to him by his boss--and future father-in-law--Mr. Worthington ([[John McMartin]]): First he must pick up a [[cougar]] for an exotic-animal activist Montgomery Bell ([[John Mills]]), then he must pick up Nikki, and lastly he must make sure she catches the next bus to her hometown, Philadelphia.  \n\nMeanwhile, Nikki's determined to catch the actual thieves and expose the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After they take a Rolls-Royce into Harlem to buy a gun--and are nearly arrested during a police raid--she tells Loudon her story; believing she's innocent, he decides to help her. She's also on the run from a [[pimp]] named Raoul ([[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]]) and his lackey Benny ([[Dennis Burkley]]), the ones who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage does he tell her the bank and the box number (6111) of her slain boyfriend.\n\nAfterward Nikki vanishes with the cougar, whom she names Murray. Loudon visits Mr. Bell to apologize for losing the animal, then finds that Nikki had delivered Murray and was waiting for Loudon at Mr. Bell's home; he has created a [[Amazon rainforest|Brazilian rainforest]] filled with animals on top of his roof. There Nikki and Loudon--who have become close--express love for each other; Murray also finds a mate. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki brokenheartedly realizes that she must go back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. On the bus she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an [[embezzlement|embezzler]] and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki [[Gate-crashing|gate-crashes]] the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested, and proclaims her love for Loudon. Nikki and Loudon ride off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as Nikki Finn\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Loudon Trott\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Wendy Worthington\n* [[John McMartin]] as Simon Worthington\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Ms. Worthington\n* [[John Mills]] as Montgomery Bell\n* Robert Swan as Detective Bellson\n* Drew Pillsbury as Detective Doyle\n* [[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]] as Raoul\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=I was young, I was twenty-eight.

Following the commercially successful ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'', her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]''\u2014where she starred with her then husband [[Sean Penn]]\u2014was a critical and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she \"struggled to come to terms with her character in ''Shanghai Surprise'', because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance with my own character.\"<ref name=\"morton1\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=189}}</ref> Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less sure about backing her up.<ref name=\"morton1\"/>\n\nMadonna felt that comedy was more of her repertoire, and proceeded to sign a comedy film titled ''Slammer'', written by Andrew Smith and [[Ken Finkleman]].

Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed [[TASS (software)|TASS]], an ancestor of [[Tin (newsreader)|tin]], the popular threaded [[Usenet]] newsreader for [[Unix]] systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.\n\nThe Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] objected to the use of ''Gnu'' in the name, ''Gnuhoo'' was changed to ''NewHoo''.<ref name=\"SlashdotGnuhoo\">{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/06/23/0849239| accessdate = April 27, 2007|work=[[Slashdot]] | title=The GnuHoo BooBoo}}</ref> [[Yahoo!]] then objected to the use of ''Hoo'' in the name, prompting a proposed name change to ''ZURL''.<ref>[http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html \"Zurl Directory\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223080027/http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html |date=December 23, 2007 }}</ref> Prior to switching to ''ZURL'', NewHoo was acquired by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the [[Open Directory License]]. Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.\n\n[[File:Odp sitecount top.png|thumb|400px|DMOZ size by date, 1998 to 2015.]]\nBy the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the [[Yahoo! Directory]].<ref>[http://www.geniac.net/odp/ ODP and Yahoo Size Charts] by ODP editor geniac</ref> DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003.

On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.\n\nIn January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project.

These directories did not license their content for [[open content]] distribution.<ref>[http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml \"Terms of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202210117/http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml|date=February 2, 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html \"GO Network Terms of Service and Conditions of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510161046/http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html |date=May 10, 2000 }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as [[ChefMoz]]<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html ''ChefMoz Fine Dining Menu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513120425/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, in: Open Directory newsletter issue Autumn 2003</ref> and an encyclopedia known as [[Open Site]].<ref>[http://open-site.org/help/ help] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629225234/http://open-site.org/help |date=June 29, 2008 }} on open-site.org</ref> Finally, according to [[Larry Sanger]], DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the [[Nupedia]] project, out of which [[Wikipedia]] grew.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/13/media.newmedia|title=This time, it'll be a Wikipedia written by experts|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Moody|first=Glyn |date=July 13, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Logo history===\n<gallery>\nGnuHoo logo.png|Original logo as from June 1998\nNewHoo logo.png|Logo after rebranding as ''NewHoo''\nOpen Directory Project logo.png|Logo after acquisition by Netscape\nDMOZ Open Directory Project logo.png|Logo from 1999 to 2014 with the name ''DMOZ''\nDMOZ logo.png|Logo from March 2014\nDMOZ logo.svg|Logo from June 2016 until the closing in March 2017\nCurlie-logo.png|Curlie Logo (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n==Content==\nGnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from [[Usenet]]. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2065949/the-search-engine-report-july-1998-number#newhoo|title=NewHoo: Yahoo Built By The Masses|work=[[Search Engine Watch]]|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for ''Adult'', ''Arts'', ''Business'', ''Computers'', ''Games'', ''Health'', ''Home'', ''News'', ''Recreation'', ''Reference'', ''Regional'', ''Science'', ''Shopping'', ''Society'', ''Sports'' and \"World\". While these sixteen ''top-level'' categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.\n\nIn July 1998, the directory became [[multilingualism|multilingual]] with the addition of the ''World'' top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the ''World'' level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.\n\nSeveral of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The ''Adult'' category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: ''Regional'' and ''Topical''.\n\nOn November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html Kids and Teens Launches!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221200521/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html |date=February 21, 2008 }} Open Directory Project Newsletter, November/December 2000</ref> Key factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:\n* stricter guidelines which limit the listing of sites to those which are targeted or \"appropriate\" for people under 18 years of age;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |title=Kids&Teens Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716060749/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |archive-date=July 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* category names as well as site descriptions use vocabulary which is \"[[age appropriate]]\";\n* ''age tags'' on each listing distinguish content appropriate for kids (age 12 and under), teens (13 to 15 years old) and mature teens (16 to 18 years old);\n* Kids and Teens content is available as a separate RDF dump;\n* editing permissions are such that the community is parallel to that of DMOZ.\n\nBy May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.\n\nSince early 2004, the whole site has been in [[UTF-8]] encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be [[ISO 8859-1]] for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.\n\n===Maintenance===\nDirectory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.\n\nRobozilla is a [[Web crawler]] written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the [[link rot]] in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.\n\nDue to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on [[Web search engine|search engine]] rankings (See [[PageRank]]), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted [[domain hijacking]], an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.\n\nWhile corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, [[bookmarklet]]s to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/176740 \"ODPExtension\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }} Mozilla based add-on, ODP Magic. formerly known as ODP Extension</ref> and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.\n\n===License and requirements===\nDMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the [[Open Directory License]], which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.\n\nThe Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the [[Free Software Foundation]] to refer to the [[Open Directory License]] as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.\n\nIn 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution license{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, which is a free license (and GPL compatible).<ref>GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccby on the Creative Commons Attribution license]</ref>\n\n===RDF dumps===\nDMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |title=Open Directory RDF Dump |publisher=Rdf.dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626235229/http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |archivedate=June 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> New versions are usually generated weekly. A DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.steevithak.com/sw/odp/rdflist.html|title=ODP/dmoz Data Dump ToDo List|work=steevithak.com|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid [[XML]], it is not valid [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.\n\n===Content users===\nDMOZ data powers the core [[directory service]]s for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]. [[Google Directory]] used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Google Streamlining: Say Goodbye to the Google Directory and Labs!|url=http://www.pandia.com/sew/3963-google-streamlining-say-goodbye-to-the-google-directory-and-labs.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Pandia Search Engine News|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Overture]] announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigablast.com/prdir.html|title=Gigablast Launches 500,000 Vertical Search Engines|work=[[Gigablast]]|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2006|9|8}}, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ Category: Sites Using ODP Data] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316003426/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ |date=March 16, 2009 }} on www.dmoz.org.

The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}, and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi |title=Become an Editor at the Open Directory Project |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827045332/http://www.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi |archive-date=August 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ's editing model is a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.<ref name=\"commguide\" />\n\nOver time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are ''editall'' privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. ''Meta'' privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. ''Cateditall'' privileges are similar to ''editall'', but only for a single directory category. Similarly, ''catmod'' privileges are similar to ''meta'', but only for a single directory category. ''Catmv'' privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with ''meta'' editors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn August 2004, a new level of privileges called ''admin'' was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.<ref name=\"adminguide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |title=Open Directory Project Administrator Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722205313/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |archive-date=July 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAll DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |title=ODP Directory Editorial Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701150829/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |archive-date=July 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely.

According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors.<ref name=\"yahooxodp\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.traffick.com/story/06-2000-xodp.asp|title=Life After the Open Directory Project|work=traffick.com|last=Prenatt, Jr|first=David F.|date=June 1, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200320/http://www.traffick.com/story/06-2000-xodp.asp|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=CmdrTaco |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/00/10/24/1252232.shtml |title=Dmoz (aka AOL) Changing Guidelines In Sketchy Way |work=[[Slashdot]]|date=October 24, 2000|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Blacklisting allegations===\nSenior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach \"warning\" or \"do not list\" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/urlnote.html Add Note to URL Feature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513105131/http://www.dmoz.org/urlnote.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, in ODP Documentation</ref>\n\n===Hierarchical structure===\nCriticism of DMOZ's [[hierarchical]] structure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of [[Web 2.0]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]] began to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, [[network (mathematics)|networks]] and [[directed graph]]s are more \"natural\" and easier to manage than hierarchies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hri\u0163cu|first=C.|url=http://hritcu.wordpress.com/2005/04/08/folksonomies-vs-ontologies/ |title=Folksonomies vs. Ontologies|work=hritcu.wordpress.com|date=April 8, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail470.html \"Ontology is Overrated\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729231420/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail470.html |date=July 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Hammond, Tony |author2=Hannay, Timo |author3=Lund, Ben |author4=Scott, Joanna |url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html |title=Social Bookmarking Tools (I)|work=[[D-Lib Magazine]]|date=April 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}\n</ref>\n\n==Software==\n===Search===\nThe ODPSearch software is a derivative version of [[Isearch]] which is [[open-source software|open-source]], licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/docs/en/searchguide.html |title=Open Directory Search Guide |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616140811/http://www.dmoz.org/docs/en/searchguide.html |archive-date=June 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Editor forums===\nThe ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary [[Ultimate Bulletin Board]] system. In June 2003, they switched to the open source [[phpBB]] system. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.\n\n===Bug tracking===\nThe bug tracking software used by the ODP is [[Bugzilla]] and the web server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]. [[Squid cache|Squid]] web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.\n\n===Interface===\nThe DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the [[GNU General Public License]]). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license. The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OtherLicenses|title=Licenses for Works of Practical Use besides Software and Documentation|work=[[GNU Project]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n* [[List of web

Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed [[TASS (software)|TASS]], an ancestor of [[Tin (newsreader)|tin]], the popular threaded [[Usenet]] newsreader for [[Unix]] systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.\n\nThe Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] objected to the use of ''Gnu'' in the name, ''Gnuhoo'' was changed to ''NewHoo''.<ref name=\"SlashdotGnuhoo\">{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/06/23/0849239| accessdate = April 27, 2007|work=[[Slashdot]] | title=The GnuHoo BooBoo}}</ref> [[Yahoo!]] then objected to the use of ''Hoo'' in the name, prompting a proposed name change to ''ZURL''.<ref>[http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html \"Zurl Directory\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223080027/http://blog.topix.com/archives/2004_05.html |date=December 23, 2007 }}</ref> Prior to switching to ''ZURL'', NewHoo was acquired by [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the [[Open Directory License]]. Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.\n\n[[File:Odp sitecount top.png|thumb|400px|DMOZ size by date, 1998 to 2015.]]\nBy the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the [[Yahoo! Directory]].<ref>[http://www.geniac.net/odp/ ODP and Yahoo Size Charts] by ODP editor geniac</ref> DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.\n\nIn January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006.<ref name=\"odpreports\">[http://freenet-homepage.de/miscellanea/odp_reports/ ODP reports] by ODP volunteer administrator chris2001</ref> These reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included \"Test\" and \"Bookmarks\" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users.

These directories did not license their content for [[open content]] distribution.<ref>[http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml \"Terms of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202210117/http://www.zeal.com/about/terms_of_use.jhtml|date=February 2, 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html \"GO Network Terms of Service and Conditions of Use\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510161046/http://info.go.com/doc/policy/terms.html |date=May 10, 2000 }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as [[ChefMoz]]<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html ''ChefMoz Fine Dining Menu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513120425/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2003Autumn/chefmoz-column.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, in: Open Directory newsletter issue Autumn 2003</ref> and an encyclopedia known as [[Open Site]].<ref>[http://open-site.org/help/ help] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629225234/http://open-site.org/help |date=June 29, 2008 }} on open-site.org</ref> Finally, according to [[Larry Sanger]], DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the [[Nupedia]] project, out of which [[Wikipedia]] grew.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/13/media.newmedia|title=This time, it'll be a Wikipedia written by experts|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Moody|first=Glyn |date=July 13, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Logo history===\n<gallery>\nGnuHoo logo.png|Original logo as from June 1998\nNewHoo logo.png|Logo after rebranding as ''NewHoo''\nOpen Directory Project logo.png|Logo after acquisition by Netscape\nDMOZ Open Directory Project logo.png|Logo from 1999 to 2014 with the name ''DMOZ''\nDMOZ logo.png|Logo from March 2014\nDMOZ logo.svg|Logo from June 2016 until the closing in March 2017\nCurlie-logo.png|Curlie Logo (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n==Content==\nGnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from [[Usenet]]. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2065949/the-search-engine-report-july-1998-number#newhoo|title=NewHoo: Yahoo Built By The Masses|work=[[Search Engine Watch]]|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=July 1, 1998|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for ''Adult'', ''Arts'', ''Business'', ''Computers'', ''Games'', ''Health'', ''Home'', ''News'', ''Recreation'', ''Reference'', ''Regional'', ''Science'', ''Shopping'', ''Society'', ''Sports'' and \"World\". While these sixteen ''top-level'' categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.\n\nIn July 1998, the directory became [[multilingualism|multilingual]] with the addition of the ''World'' top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the ''World'' level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.\n\nSeveral of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The ''Adult'' category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: ''Regional'' and ''Topical''.\n\nOn November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html Kids and Teens Launches!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221200521/http://www.dmoz.org/newsletter/2000Nov/press.html |date=February 21, 2008 }} Open Directory Project Newsletter, November/December 2000</ref> Key factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:\n* stricter guidelines which limit the listing of sites to those which are targeted or \"appropriate\" for people under 18 years of age;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |title=Kids&Teens Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716060749/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/kguidelines/ |archive-date=July 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* category names as well as site descriptions use vocabulary which is \"[[age appropriate]]\";\n* ''age tags'' on each listing distinguish content appropriate for kids (age 12 and under), teens (13 to 15 years old) and mature teens (16 to 18 years old);\n* Kids and Teens content is available as a separate RDF dump;\n* editing permissions are such that the community is parallel to that of DMOZ.\n\nBy May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.\n\nSince early 2004, the whole site has been in [[UTF-8]] encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be [[ISO 8859-1]] for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.\n\n===Maintenance===\nDirectory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.\n\nRobozilla is a [[Web crawler]] written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the [[link rot]] in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.\n\nDue to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on [[Web search engine|search engine]] rankings (See [[PageRank]]), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted [[domain hijacking]], an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.\n\nWhile corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, [[bookmarklet]]s to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons,<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/176740 \"ODPExtension\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }} Mozilla based add-on, ODP Magic. formerly known as ODP Extension</ref> and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.\n\n===License and requirements===\nDMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the [[Open Directory License]], which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.\n\nThe Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the [[Free Software Foundation]] to refer to the [[Open Directory License]] as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.\n\nIn 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution license{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, which is a free license (and GPL compatible).<ref>GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccby on the Creative Commons Attribution license]</ref>\n\n===RDF dumps===\nDMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |title=Open Directory RDF Dump |publisher=Rdf.dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626235229/http://rdf.dmoz.org/ |archivedate=June 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> New versions are usually generated weekly. A DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.steevithak.com/sw/odp/rdflist.html|title=ODP/dmoz Data Dump ToDo List|work=steevithak.com|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref> So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid [[XML]], it is not valid [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.\n\n===Content users===\nDMOZ data powers the core [[directory service]]s for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]. [[Google Directory]] used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Google Streamlining: Say Goodbye to the Google Directory and Labs!|url=http://www.pandia.com/sew/3963-google-streamlining-say-goodbye-to-the-google-directory-and-labs.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Pandia Search Engine News|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Overture]] announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigablast.com/prdir.html|title=Gigablast Launches 500,000 Vertical Search Engines|work=[[Gigablast]]|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2006|9|8}}, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages.<ref>[http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ Category: Sites Using ODP Data] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316003426/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/ |date=March 16, 2009 }} on www.dmoz.org.

The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}, and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi |title=Become an Editor at the Open Directory Project |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827045332/http://www.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi |archive-date=August 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ's editing model is a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.<ref name=\"commguide\" />\n\nOver time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are ''editall'' privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. ''Meta'' privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. ''Cateditall'' privileges are similar to ''editall'', but only for a single directory category. Similarly, ''catmod'' privileges are similar to ''meta'', but only for a single directory category. ''Catmv'' privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with ''meta'' editors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn August 2004, a new level of privileges called ''admin'' was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.<ref name=\"adminguide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |title=Open Directory Project Administrator Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722205313/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/admin/ |archive-date=July 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAll DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |title=ODP Directory Editorial Guidelines |publisher=Dmoz.org |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701150829/http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/ |archive-date=July 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely.

[[Squid cache|Squid]] web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.\n\n===Interface===\nThe DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the [[GNU General Public License]]).

The power button is recessed on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2, while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom have a red accent instead. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 have dual front-facing cameras housed in a pill-shaped cutout, resembling the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10+]], while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom retain the pop-up camera from the K20. At the rear, the camera protrusion is a single unit with a dual-LED flash below surrounded by a circular accent. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 have an oval module, while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom have a circular module. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 launched in (Phoenix) Red, (Matrix) Purple and (Atlantis) Blue, with an additional White finish available on the 5G version; the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom will launch in Grey, Purple, White and Blue. Branding varies between devices, with the K30 and K30 5G having a vertically oriented Redmi logo, the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom having a horizontally oriented Redmi logo, and the Poco X2 having a horizontally oriented Poco logo.\n\n===Hardware & Software===\nThe primary camera has been upgraded from a 48 MP sensor to a 64 MP sensor on all variants, while the telephoto lens is exclusive to the K30 Pro Zoom along with optical image stabilization on the wide lens, with other variants having a macro camera. The camera array on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 consists of a 64 MP wide sensor, an 8 MP ultrawide sensor, a 2 MP dedicated macro camera and a 2 MP depth sensor. On the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom, the ultrawide sensor's resolution is 13 MP, however the resolution of the wide sensor and depth sensor remain the same. The K30 Pro has a 5 MP macro camera, while the K30 Pro Zoom has an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom; the K30 Pro Zoom also has OIS on the primary lens. The selfie camera's resolution is still 20 MP, and it is joined by a 2 MP depth sensor on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2. At the front, the display itself is larger than the K20's at 6.67\" (169.4mm) and has a wider 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] with a 120Hz [[refresh rate]] and HDR10 support. However, the screen is an LCD panel as opposed to the AMOLED panel of the K20 and K20 Pro, and as a result the fingerprint sensor is located on the side rather than an in-display optical unit. The K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom use an AMOLED display with an optical sensor and HDR10+ support, but only have a 60Hz refresh rate. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 700 series SoCs, with the K30 retaining the K20's Snapdragon 730G and Adreno 618 while the K30 5G receives the newer Snapdragon 765G and Adreno 620. The K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom use the flagship Snapdragon 865 and Adreno 650. Storage and RAM options have been carried over from the K20 (64, 128 or 256 GB of UFS 2.1 storage and 6 or 8 GB of RAM), although [[microSD]] card expansion is now supported up to 256 GB on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2. The K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom have either 128 or 256 GB of storage and 6 or 8 GB of RAM with an additional 12 GB RAM/512 GB UFS variant on the K30 Pro Zoom; the 128 GB/6 GB K30 Pro model has UFS 3.0 while other models have UFS 3.1.The battery is 4500mAh on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2, and 4700mAh on the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom. Fast charging is supported for all devices; the K30 & Poco X2 support up to 27W, the K30 5G supports up to 30W, and the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom support up to 33W. All devices are pre-installed with [[MIUI]] 11, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Android

The power button is recessed on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2, while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom have a red accent instead. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 have dual front-facing cameras housed in a pill-shaped cutout, resembling the [[Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10+]], while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom retain the pop-up camera from the K20. At the rear, the camera protrusion is a single unit with a dual-LED flash below surrounded by a circular accent. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 have an oval module, while the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom have a circular module. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 launched in (Phoenix) Red, (Matrix) Purple and (Atlantis) Blue, with an additional White finish available on the 5G version; the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom will launch in Grey, Purple, White and Blue. Branding varies between devices, with the K30 and K30 5G having a vertically oriented Redmi logo, the K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom having a horizontally oriented Redmi logo, and the Poco X2 having a horizontally oriented Poco logo.\n\n===Hardware & Software===\nThe primary camera has been upgraded from a 48 MP sensor to a 64 MP sensor on all variants, while the telephoto lens is exclusive to the K30 Pro Zoom along with optical image stabilization on the wide lens, with other variants having a macro camera. The camera array on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 consists of a 64 MP wide sensor, an 8 MP ultrawide sensor, a 2 MP dedicated macro camera and a 2 MP depth sensor. On the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom, the ultrawide sensor's resolution is 13 MP, however the resolution of the wide sensor and depth sensor remain the same. The K30 Pro has a 5 MP macro camera, while the K30 Pro Zoom has an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom; the K30 Pro Zoom also has OIS on the primary lens. The selfie camera's resolution is still 20 MP, and it is joined by a 2 MP depth sensor on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2. At the front, the display itself is larger than the K20's at 6.67\" (169.4mm) and has a wider 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] with a 120Hz [[refresh rate]] and HDR10 support. However, the screen is an LCD panel as opposed to the AMOLED panel of the K20 and K20 Pro, and as a result the fingerprint sensor is located on the side rather than an in-display optical unit. The K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom use an AMOLED display with an optical sensor and HDR10+ support, but only have a 60Hz refresh rate. The K30, K30 5G and Poco X2 are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 700 series SoCs, with the K30 retaining the K20's Snapdragon 730G and Adreno 618 while the K30 5G receives the newer Snapdragon 765G and Adreno 620. The K30 Pro and K30 Pro Zoom use the flagship Snapdragon 865 and Adreno 650. Storage and RAM options have been carried over from the K20 (64, 128 or 256 GB of UFS 2.1 storage and 6 or 8 GB of RAM), although [[microSD]] card expansion is now supported up to 256 GB on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2. The K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom have either 128 or 256 GB of storage and 6 or 8 GB of RAM with an additional 12 GB RAM/512 GB UFS variant on the K30 Pro Zoom; the 128 GB/6 GB K30 Pro model has UFS 3.0 while other models have UFS 3.1.The battery is 4500mAh on the K30, K30 5G and Poco X2, and 4700mAh on the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom. Fast charging is supported for all devices; the K30 & Poco X2 support up to 27W, the K30 5G supports up to 30W, and the K30 Pro & K30 Pro Zoom support up to 33W. All devices are pre-installed with [[MIUI]] 11, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Android smartphones}}\n{{Xiaomi}}\n\n[[Category:Smartphones]]\n[[Category:Xiaomi]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019]]\n", "name_user": "Gaurav sunil Gaddapwar", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Redmi k30 come 5G smartphone chipset  Snapdragoan 865)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmi_K30"}

One Solution, Revolution! ====\nSocialist Aotearoa is a revolutionary, socialist, anti capitalist group.\u00a0 We fight for socialism from below, system change not climate change, and Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s battle cry that \u201cRevolutionaries are those who fight the hardest for reforms in the here and now!\u201d\n\n==== 2. Workers of the World, Unite ====\nSocialist Aotearoa is an international socialist group.\u00a0 We oppose all imperialist wars and occupations, and support all genuine national liberation struggles for independence.\u00a0 We demand the immediate withdrawal of New Zealand colonial troops from Afghanistan and the Pacific.\u00a0 We support the struggle for Tino Rangatiratanga and self determination for Maori in Aotearoa, fully aware of the bloody history of the New Zealand state\u2019s past and the dispossession of Maori today.\u00a0 We welcome refugees and immigrants to Aotearoa, and fight against racism wherever we find it.\n\n==== 3.\u00a0Equality For All ====\nWe oppose all oppressions based on race, gender, sexuality and religion, except Maori, they get extra stuff.\n\n==== 4.\u00a0United Fronts ====\nSocialist Aotearoa will co-operate with other left wing parties, unions and movements, but maintain its organisational independence and state its politics honestly and openly.\u00a0 We will work in United Fronts, but reserve the right to publish and contribute our own socialist ideas within them.\n\n==== 5.\u00a0For a Rank and File Network Within the Trade Union Movement ====\nThe working class movement is the force we believe will change the world.\u00a0 As demonstrated by general strikes and revolutions throughout the decades, it has the power to shut down the system and replace it with a better world based on sharing and direct democracy.\u00a0 As such, Socialist Aotearoa members are active in our unions as volunteers, members, delegates and organisers.\n\nWe are with the union leaders when they fight, but believe that union bureaucracy acts as a negotiating layer between the workers and the bosses.\u00a0 In order to counteract the influence of the Labour Party\u2019s union bosses, rank-and-file union members and delegates must organise a cross-union, cross-industry network of solidarity and struggle.\n\n== Mt.
