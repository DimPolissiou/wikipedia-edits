Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters.

The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch3.htm |title= Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter III: The Accident |publisher=NASA |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 14, 2020}}</ref> Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53&nbsp;\u00b0F (12&nbsp;\u00b0C) had been ignored by NASA managers.<ref name=challenger_report_ch6>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |publisher=Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' disintegrated during re-entry, killing its crew of seven, because of damage to the [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon]] leading edge of the wing caused during launch.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

A struggle of wills begins between the authorities and the villagers, who resort to a variety of ways to prevent damage to the historic island. Harry Tilney ([[Niall MacGinnis]]) is all for taking on the government, but his compatriot, Sally ([[Muriel Pavlow]]) has a boyfriend stationed at the nearby [[Royal Air Force]] base, Corporal Bill Morris ([[John Gregson]]), so she goes to see him first.\n\nMeanwhile, Squadron Leader Parsons ([[Kieron Moore]]) is informed that his unit's mission is being changed to ground attack. The [[de Havilland Vampire]] jets have to be modified to mount rockets. Parsons is informed he will have three weeks for the conversion, then four weeks to get his men trained. His commanding officer is not at liberty to inform him that the unit will then be sent overseas, but he takes the hint.\n\nThe land acquisition is assigned to a bureaucrat, Mr. Wentworth ([[William Mervyn]]), which is rather awkward for him, as he is a prominent member of a bird watching society. He comes to discuss the situation with Harry, but Harry is drunk and drives him away. The villagers then learn that fishing rights to the area were granted to the people by Henry VIII. \"Soapy\" ([[Bartlett Mullins]]), the professional eel catcher, can squat on the land and use those rights to block the acquisition. However, Soapy receives a letter from the government stating that there is no evidence that such rights exist.\n\n\"Bookie\" ([[Charles Lloyd-Pack]]) then discovers that the land was given to the Church by Henry VIII for assistance in quelling a rebellion. The villagers present this information to Parsons. He agrees to pass it along to the Government, but in the meantime he insists on continuing with the training.\n\nIn desperation, the local people take to their boats and sail to the island, to occupy the target area and prevent the first attack run. However, the field telephone wire is broken as they come ashore, meaning the RAF controller on the range cannot get a message through to have the flight cancelled. Low cloud cover conceals the site from the approaching aircraft, which commence their attack run, but fortunately the protestors are spotted by the leading aircraft and the attack is aborted just in time to avoid a disaster.\n\nThe near miss means that there will have to be an official inquiry, which will take months or a year, by which time the unit will have been sent to Malaya.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Gregson]] as Cpl.

The group went on to release a number of self-released singles until doing tenures at City of Angels and Warner Bros. Records from the mid-1990s into the early 2000s. Mephisto Odyssey are also credited with being the only group to officially remix [[Jane's Addiction]] for the maxi-single \"So What!\". The group released many singles and remixes as well as an EP and two full-length albums during the life of the band. This included the song \"Crash\" which was co written with [[Wayne Static]] of [[Static-X]] and \"Some Kinda Freak\" which was featured in the horror film [[Hostel]].<ref>[http://allmusic.com/artist/mephisto-odyssey-p168920 Official Mephisto Odyssey page on allmusic]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Inception and debut single (1993\u20141996)===\n\nMephisto Odyssey was originally formed in the fall of 1993 by musician, songwriter / producer [[Mikael Johnston]] and producer / songwriter Michael Ames.

After a handful of singles and the release of their first full-length album '''Catching The Skinny''' the then duo caught the ear of [[Warner Bros. Records]] A & R rep Troy Wallace. Troy offered the duo the chance to work on a remix project with Jane's Addiction for the upcoming maxi single '''So What!''' Mephisto Odyssey co produced the remixes with long-time friend and Primal Record Shop owner Barrie Eves who officially joined the group soon after.<ref>[http://allmusic.com/album/so-what-r429878/credits Jane's Addiction \"So What\" Credits on Allmusic.com]</ref> The official release featured 3 remixes by Mephisto Odyssey and went on to spend 6 weeks in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] maxi singles chart which paved the way for a [[Warner Bros.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

distancing) includes [[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

This means that the songs contain a story with characters and plot. The album's booklet contains the songs' lyrics plus a part of the story that each song narrates.\n\nThe main character of the story is Neil Legweak. He is one of the few survivors, if not the last one, of mankind. He writes down his memories about the past.\n\nThe story is about a young boy named Boris Jay who receives a crystal key from a dark creature. He uses the key and breaks the seal of hell. He returns to Earth as a young man equipped with the instruments of evil, and his political ambitions are immense. He soon rises to power and starts a world war. During this war our main character (Neil Legweak) loses his warrior sister. The war lasts three years and is devastating; one third of the Earth is contaminated. Boris is executed by his own generals. Our main character flees to a distant island only to face his nightmares again as creatures from the island's volcano gather the population and lead them into it. Our main character manages to escape and returns to a collapsed civilization. After a year he discovers that evil forces have found a new candidate for their purposes, Albert Twostone, who was one of the prisoners inside the volcano. Our character departs once again just before a new world war begins. He returns to the island where he decides to spend the rest of his days hoping one day to see other survivors return.\n\n==Additional information==\nThe band's leader Axel Julius has stated in an interview several years after the release of the album that the Balkan war was a heavy influence for him. He also stated that he believed there were many \"Upright Liars\" in today's political scene.\n\n{{Scanner (band)}}\n\n[[Category:1995 albums]]\n[[Category:Scanner (band) albums]]\n[[Category:Massacre Records albums]]\n\n\n{{1990s-metal-album-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox album\n| name       = Mental Reservation\n| type       = studio\n| artist     = [[Scanner (Band)|Scanner]]\n| cover      = Mental Reservation.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1995\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Speed metal]], [[power metal]]\n| length     = 1:03:07\n| label      = [[Massacre Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Terminal Earth]]\n| prev_year  = 1989\n| next_title = [[Ball of the Damned]]\n| next_year  = 1997\n}}\n'''''Mental Reservation''''' is the third full-length album by the [[power metal]] band [[Scanner (Band)|Scanner]].
