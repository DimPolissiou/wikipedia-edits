It can be described as such: {{quote|The Counter-Economy is the sum of all non-aggressive Human Action which is forbidden by the State. Counter-economics is the study of the Counter-Economy and its practices. The Counter-Economy includes the free market, the Black Market, the \"underground economy,\" all acts of civil and social disobedience, all acts of forbidden association (sexual, racial, cross-religious), and anything else the State, at any place or time, chooses to prohibit, control, regulate, tax, or tariff. The Counter-Economy excludes all State-approved action (the \"[[White market|White Market]]\") and the [[Red Market]] (violence and theft not approved by the State).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf|title=Counter-Economics: what it is, how it works|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044459/http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009|website=Agorism.info}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Profitable civil disobedience ====\nAgorism believes gradual withdrawal of state support through what Konkin described as \"Profitable Civil Disobedience\".<ref name=LastWhole/> Starving the state of its revenue and purpose by transferring these responsibilities over to decentralized institutions is the most feasible way to achieve free markets according to agorism: {{quote|Rather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state retreat (if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested interests), one could commit civil disobedience profitably, dodging taxes and regulations, having lower costs and (potentially) greater efficiency than one's statist competitors \u2013 if any.<ref name=LastWhole/>}}\n\n==== Opposition to political parties ====\nAgorism does not support political engagement in the form of political party promotion as a means to transition to a [[free-market anarchism]]. The methods of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] are not compatible with agorist principles. Konkin referred to these attempts to fight for free markets through state approved channels of operation as \"partyarchy\": {{quote|Partyarchy, the anti-concept of pursuing libertarian ends through statist means, especially political parties.<ref name=\"newlibman\">{{cite web|last=Konkin III|first=Samuel Edward|url=http://agorism.info/docs/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf|title=New Libertarian Manifesto|year=1980|website=Agorism.info|accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Voluntary association ====\nAs with voluntaryists, agorists typically oppose electoral voting and political reform and instead they stress the importance of alternative strategies outside political systems to achieve a free society. Agorists claim that such a society could be freed more readily by employing methods such as [[education]], [[direct action]], [[Alternative currency|alternative currencies]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[self sufficiency]], [[civil disobedience]] and [[counter-economics]].<ref name=\"newlibman\"/>\n\n=== Konkin's class theory ===\nKonkin developed a class theory which includes [[entrepreneur]]s, non-statist [[capitalist]]s and [[State capitalism|statist capitalist]]:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Entrepreneur\n|Non-statist capitalist\n|Statist capitalist\n|-\n|Good\n|Neutral\n|Bad\n|-\n|Innovator, risk-taker, producer<br>The strength of a freed market\n|Holders of capital<br>Not necessarily ideologically aware<br>\"Relatively drone-like non-innovators\"\n|The primary beneficiaries of government controls<br>\"The main Evil in the political realm\"\n|}\nKonkin claimed that while agorists see these three classes differently, [[anarcho-capitalist]]s tend to conflate the first and second types while \"[[Marxist|Marxoids]] and cruder collectivists\" conflate all three.<ref name=inter/>\n\n== Concept of property ==\nThe agorists prefer the term \"[[free market]]\" to \"[[capitalism]]\", mostly because it bears no ties to the implications the latter term has in history. The term \"capitalism\" originally referred to [[mercantilism]], the use of public chartering and corporations to let the political class dominate and [[legal plunder|plunder]] important industries. It was first used by [[Louis Blanc]] in ''Organisation du Travail'' (1851), later in 1861 by anarchist [[Pierre Proudhon]] and notably making it popular in 1867 by [[Karl Marx]] in a more specific sense to refer to control of industry by the political class. It only later came to be conflated with actual free markets. The favoritism of the government towards determined corporations is seen by agorists as the characteristic that renders much more illegitimate the intervention of the state in various sectors. According to agorists, state-imposed restrictions in favor of certain companies distort the market, making the aforementioned businesses less responsible and less capable. The agorists claim that the debts of businesses cannot be cleared through a government's decree and that every manager has to be responsible for every act taken.\n\nKonkin opposed the concept of [[intellectual property]] and wrote in an article entitled \"Copywrongs\" in support of such a thesis.<ref>Konkin III, Samuel Edward. [http://users.aol.com/vlntryst/wn20.html \"Copywrongs\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813211015/http://users.aol.com/vlntryst/wn20.html|date=13 August 2006}}</ref> [[J. Neil Schulman]] criticized this thesis in \"Informational Property: Logorights\".<ref>Shulman, J. Neil. [http://www.pulpless.com/bp21samp/logorite.html \"Informational Property: Logorights\"].</ref> Whereas Konkin was opposed to the laws of the state in the cases of [[patents]] and [[copyright]], seen as creators of monopolies and distortion, Schulman agreed with Konkin that the state could not be a foundation for any class of rightful property yet sought to demonstrate that exclusive ownership rights could apply to what he ultimately termed \"Media Carried Property\"\u2014created objects that exist independent of the subjective human mind yet are not themselves made of atoms or molecules.<ref>Shulman, J.

Neil Schulman]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Alongside Night]]'' in 1979. [[Ayn Rand]]'s example, presenting her ideas in the form of a work of fiction in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', had inspired Schulman to do likewise. Konkin's afterword to the novel, \"How Far Alongside Night?\", credited Schulman with integrating the \"science of counter-economics\" with Konkin's basic economic philosophy.<ref>Afterword by Samuel Edward Konkin III in ''Alongside Night'' (1999).

It can be described as such: {{quote|The Counter-Economy is the sum of all non-aggressive Human Action which is forbidden by the State. Counter-economics is the study of the Counter-Economy and its practices. The Counter-Economy includes the free market, the Black Market, the \"underground economy,\" all acts of civil and social disobedience, all acts of forbidden association (sexual, racial, cross-religious), and anything else the State, at any place or time, chooses to prohibit, control, regulate, tax, or tariff. The Counter-Economy excludes all State-approved action (the \"White Market\") and the Red Market (violence and theft not approved by the State).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf|title=Counter-Economics: what it is, how it works|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044459/http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009|website=Agorism.info}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Profitable civil disobedience ====\nAgorism believes gradual withdrawal of state support through what Konkin described as \"Profitable Civil Disobedience\".<ref name=LastWhole/> Starving the state of its revenue and purpose by transferring these responsibilities over to decentralized institutions is the most feasible way to achieve free markets according to agorism: {{quote|Rather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state retreat (if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested interests), one could commit civil disobedience profitably, dodging taxes and regulations, having lower costs and (potentially) greater efficiency than one's statist competitors \u2013 if any.<ref name=LastWhole/>}}\n\n==== Opposition to political parties ====\nAgorism does not support political engagement in the form of political party promotion as a means to transition to a [[free-market anarchism]]. The methods of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] are not compatible with agorist principles. Konkin referred to these attempts to fight for free markets through state approved channels of operation as \"partyarchy\": {{quote|Partyarchy, the anti-concept of pursuing libertarian ends through statist means, especially political parties.<ref name=\"newlibman\">{{cite web|last=Konkin III|first=Samuel Edward|url=http://agorism.info/docs/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf|title=New Libertarian Manifesto|year=1980|website=Agorism.info|accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Voluntary association ====\nAs with voluntaryists, agorists typically oppose electoral voting and political reform and instead they stress the importance of alternative strategies outside political systems to achieve a free society. Agorists claim that such a society could be freed more readily by employing methods such as [[education]], [[direct action]], [[Alternative currency|alternative currencies]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[self sufficiency]], [[civil disobedience]] and [[counter-economics]].<ref name=\"newlibman\"/>\n\n=== Konkin's class theory ===\nKonkin developed a class theory which includes [[entrepreneur]]s, non-statist [[capitalist]]s and [[State capitalism|statist capitalist]]:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Entrepreneur\n|Non-statist capitalist\n|Statist capitalist\n|-\n|Good\n|Neutral\n|Bad\n|-\n|Innovator, risk-taker, producer<br>The strength of a freed market\n|Holders of capital<br>Not necessarily ideologically aware<br>\"Relatively drone-like non-innovators\"\n|The primary beneficiaries of government controls<br>\"The main Evil in the political realm\"\n|}\nKonkin claimed that while agorists see these three classes differently, [[anarcho-capitalist]]s tend to conflate the first and second types while \"[[Marxist|Marxoids]] and cruder collectivists\" conflate all three.<ref name=inter/>\n\n== Concept of property ==\nThe agorists prefer the term \"[[free market]]\" to \"[[capitalism]]\", mostly because it bears no ties to the implications the latter term has in history. The term \"capitalism\" originally referred to [[mercantilism]], the use of public chartering and corporations to let the political class dominate and [[legal plunder|plunder]] important industries. It was first used by [[Louis Blanc]] in ''Organisation du Travail'' (1851), later in 1861 by anarchist [[Pierre Proudhon]] and notably making it popular in 1867 by [[Karl Marx]] in a more specific sense to refer to control of industry by the political class. It only later came to be conflated with actual free markets. The favoritism of the government towards determined corporations is seen by agorists as the characteristic that renders much more illegitimate the intervention of the state in various sectors. According to agorists, state-imposed restrictions in favor of certain companies distort the market, making the aforementioned businesses less responsible and less capable. The agorists claim that the debts of businesses cannot be cleared through a government's decree and that every manager has to be responsible for every act taken.\n\nKonkin opposed the concept of [[intellectual property]] and wrote in an article entitled \"Copywrongs\" in support of such a thesis.<ref>Konkin III, Samuel Edward. [http://users.aol.com/vlntryst/wn20.html \"Copywrongs\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813211015/http://users.aol.com/vlntryst/wn20.html|date=13 August 2006}}</ref> [[J.

[http://www.pulpless.com/bp21samp/logorite.html \"Informational Property: Logorights\"].</ref> Whereas Konkin was opposed to the laws of the state in the cases of [[patents]] and [[copyright]], seen as creators of monopolies and distortion, Schulman agreed with Konkin that the state could not be a foundation for any class of rightful property yet sought to demonstrate that exclusive ownership rights could apply to what he ultimately termed \"Media Carried Property\"\u2014created objects that exist independent of the subjective human mind yet are not themselves made of atoms or molecules.<ref>Shulman, J.

National [[Kennel club|kennel clubs]], including the United Kingdom's [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] and the [[American Kennel Club]], refer to the breed as simply the '''Mastiff'''.  They perhaps descended from the ancient [[Alaunt]] and [[Pugnaces Britanniae]], with a significant input from the [[Alpine  Mastiff]] in the 19th century. Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as [[Mastiff|mastiff-type dog]]s, or, confusingly, just as \"mastiffs\".\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:EnglishMastiffChurchill.JPG|thumb|Fawn English Mastiff]]\nWith a massive body, broad skull and head of generally [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|square]] appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the [[Irish Wolfhound]] and [[Great Dane]] can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |title=The Biggest Dog Breed |publisher=Bigpawsonly.com |accessdate=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725033914/http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |archivedate=25 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>   \n\nThe body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs\u2014which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is {{convert|30|in|cm}} at the shoulder for males and {{convert|27.5|in|cm}} (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh {{convert|150|-|250|lb|kg}}, a typical female can weigh {{convert|120|-|200|lb|kg}}, with very large individuals reaching {{convert|300|lb|kg}} or more.\n\n===Coat colour standards===\nThe former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long haired Mastiffs, known as \"Fluffies\", are caused by a recessive gene\u2014they are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-[[brindle]], always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. [[Image:Mastif angielski pregowany 768.jpg|thumb|left|The Mastiff has a distinctive head with [[dewlap]] and [[snout|flews]]. The black mask is visible even on this brindle.]]\n\nThe colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black [[brindle]]. A [[melanistic mask|black mask]] should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light \"silver\" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. [[piebald|Pied]] Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.<ref>Clarence C. Little, ''The Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs'', Howell Book House, 1957</ref>\n[[File:Mastiff1.jpg|thumb|Two Mastiffs: one apricot, one fawn]]\n\n[[coat (dog)#Genetic basis of color and pattern|The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs]] has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/dogcolors.html |title=Dog Coat Color Genetics |publisher=Homepage.usask.ca |accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are [[ploidy|diploid]] animals, each gene location ([[locus (genetics)|locus]]) appears twice in every animal, so questions of [[dominance (genetics)|dominance]] also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are A<sup>y</sup>BDE<sup>m</sup>h(k<sup>br</sup>_or_k<sup>y</sup>)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-[[merle (dog coat)|merle]], and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include \"b\" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), \"d\" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), \"s<sup>p</sup>\" (pied spotting), and perhaps \"a\" (recessive black). The possible combination of [[homozygous]] brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as [[liver (color)#Liver in dogs|isabella]] in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be \"I\" (apricot) or \"i\" (non-apricot) and perhaps \"c<sup>ch</sup>\" (silver lightening) or \"C\" (without silver lightening).<ref>Sheila M.

[[Sydenham Edwards]] wrote in 1800 in the ''Cynographia Britannica'':\n<blockquote>What the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the kindest of his race. His docility is perfect; the teazing of the smaller kinds will hardly provoke him to resent, and I have seen him down with his paw the Terrier or cur that has bit him, without offering further injury. In a family he will permit the children to play with him, and suffer all their little pranks without offence. The blind ferocity of the Bull Dog will often wound the hand of the master who assists him to combat, but the Mastiff distinguishes perfectly, enters the field with temper, and engages in the attack as if confident of success: if he overpowers, or is beaten, his master may take him immediately in his arms and fear nothing. This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the [[leopard|pard]], and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the [[deserts]] of [[Zaara]] or the [[plain]]s of [[Numidia]].<ref>[[Sydenham Edwards]]''Cynographia Britannica'', 1800 London: C. Whittingham</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[American Kennel Club]] sums up the Mastiff breed as:\n:a combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Kennel Club \u2013 Mastiff|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/mastiff/|publisher=The American Kennel Club|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Mastiff pup 4 weeks.jpg|thumb|left|Even at four weeks, a Mastiff should seem massive.]]\nAt all stages of development, the Mastiff should show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement.\nThe Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first two years of the dog's life, in order not to damage the [[growth plate]]s in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5&nbsp;lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog's life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed's large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing.  A [[whelping box]], along with careful monitoring can prevent such accidents.

This may have led to decline in the aggressive Mastiffs used for this purpose, but Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses.\n\nSystematic breeding began in the 19th century,<ref name=Wynn>''The History of the Mastiff'', M. B. Wynn 1885. William Loxley.</ref> when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head [[gamekeeper]] of [[Kirklees Hall]], whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson's grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the [[Bold Hall]] line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from [[narrowboat|canal boat]] men, another caught by Crabtree in a [[Red Fox|fox]] [[Animal trapping|trap]], a dog from [[Nostal priory]] and another dog from [[Walton Hall, West Yorkshire|Walton Hall]], owned by the naturalist, [[Charles Waterton]]. J. W. Thompson's first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer [[Bill George (dog dealer)|Bill George]], to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an [[Alpine Mastiff]] bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|Marquis of Hertford]]. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White's possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson's. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Mastiff Pluto 1830.jpg|thumb|Marquis of Hertford's [[cropped ear|crop-eared]] black Mastiff Pluto (1830)]]\n\nAnother important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The [[Royal Engineers]].<ref>\"The chronicles of the Garniers of Hampshire during four centuries, 1530\u20131900\" (https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofgarn00garn/chroniclesofgarn00garn_djvu.txt)</ref> He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at [[Leadenhall Market]], was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at [[Tattersalls]] and suspected by Garnier of containing a \"dash of Boarhound\", an ancestral form of [[Great Dane]]. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines. (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a [[Scottish Deerhound]], and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and [[Irish Wolfhound]]s.)[[File:Lukey's Governor (Mastiff).jpg|thumb|left|Lukey's Governor, born 1861, a six generation ancestor of Ch. Crown Prince]][[File:Crown Prince.jpg|thumb|left|The controversial Ch. Crown Prince, pictured in old age.]] In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but [[stifle joint|straight-stifled]] and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common.[[File:John Paul \"Four Dogs\".jpg|thumb|[[John Paul (artist)|John Paul]]'s 1867 painting showing a typical mid-19th century longer-headed apricot brindle.]] Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist [[Mark Hanbury Beaufoy]], later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America.[[File:Mastiff Champion Beaufort.jpg|thumb|left|Beaufort, acclaimed 19th century champion, grandson of Crown Prince.]] Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time the [[First World War]] ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain.\n\n===After the First World War===\nIn 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the [[Second World War]] Those who can still be found in modern [[pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s were 12 in number,<ref>(1) Roxbury Boy, (2) Millfold Lass, (3) Buzzard Pride (survived only by Merle's Brunhilda of Lyme Hall, who was in turn survived only by Shanno of Lyme Hall), (4) Gyn of Hammercliffe, (5) Duke of Hellingly, (6) Kathleen of Hellingly, (7) King of Hellingly (survived only by Eric of Altnacraig), (8) Maude of Hellingly, (9) Crusader of Goring (survived only by Blythe of Hampden), (10) Goldhawk Elsie, (11) Broomcourt Nell, (12) Rolanda, ''The History & Management of the Mastiff'', Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004</ref> meaning the North American contribution to the [[gene pool]] after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs.\n\nIn the [[British Isles]] during the Second World War virtually all Mastiff breeding stopped due to the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] of meat.

Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant [[giant dog breed|giant breeds]] such as [[Bullmastiff]]s and [[St. Bernard dog|St. Bernards]], with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff.

Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as [[Mastiff|mastiff-type dog]]s, or, confusingly, just as \"mastiffs\".\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:EnglishMastiffChurchill.JPG|thumb|Fawn English Mastiff]]\nWith a massive body, broad skull and head of generally [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|square]] appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the [[Irish Wolfhound]] and [[Great Dane]] can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |title=The Biggest Dog Breed |publisher=Bigpawsonly.com |accessdate=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725033914/http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |archivedate=25 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>   \n\nThe body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs\u2014which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is {{convert|30|in|cm}} at the shoulder for males and {{convert|27.5|in|cm}} (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh {{convert|150|-|250|lb|kg}}, a typical female can weigh {{convert|120|-|200|lb|kg}}, with very large individuals reaching {{convert|300|lb|kg}} or more.\n\n===Coat colour standards===\nThe former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long haired Mastiffs, known as \"Fluffies\", are caused by a recessive gene\u2014they are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-[[brindle]], always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. [[Image:Mastif angielski pregowany 768.jpg|thumb|left|The Mastiff has a distinctive head with [[dewlap]] and [[snout|flews]]. The black mask is visible even on this brindle.]]\n\nThe colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black [[brindle]]. A [[melanistic mask|black mask]] should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light \"silver\" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. [[piebald|Pied]] Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.<ref>Clarence C. Little, ''The Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs'', Howell Book House, 1957</ref>\n[[File:Mastiff1.jpg|thumb|Two Mastiffs: one apricot, one fawn]]\n\n[[coat (dog)#Genetic basis of color and pattern|The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs]] has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/dogcolors.html |title=Dog Coat Color Genetics |publisher=Homepage.usask.ca |accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are [[ploidy|diploid]] animals, each gene location ([[locus (genetics)|locus]]) appears twice in every animal, so questions of [[dominance (genetics)|dominance]] also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are A<sup>y</sup>BDE<sup>m</sup>h(k<sup>br</sup>_or_k<sup>y</sup>)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-[[merle (dog coat)|merle]], and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include \"b\" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), \"d\" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), \"s<sup>p</sup>\" (pied spotting), and perhaps \"a\" (recessive black). The possible combination of [[homozygous]] brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as [[liver (color)#Liver in dogs|isabella]] in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be \"I\" (apricot) or \"i\" (non-apricot) and perhaps \"c<sup>ch</sup>\" (silver lightening) or \"C\" (without silver lightening).<ref>Sheila M.

[[Sydenham Edwards]] wrote in 1800 in the ''Cynographia Britannica'':\n<blockquote>What the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the kindest of his race. His docility is perfect; the teazing of the smaller kinds will hardly provoke him to resent, and I have seen him down with his paw the Terrier or cur that has bit him, without offering further injury. In a family he will permit the children to play with him, and suffer all their little pranks without offence. The blind ferocity of the Bull Dog will often wound the hand of the master who assists him to combat, but the Mastiff distinguishes perfectly, enters the field with temper, and engages in the attack as if confident of success: if he overpowers, or is beaten, his master may take him immediately in his arms and fear nothing. This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the [[leopard|pard]], and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the [[deserts]] of [[Zaara]] or the [[plain]]s of [[Numidia]].<ref>[[Sydenham Edwards]]''Cynographia Britannica'', 1800 London: C. Whittingham</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[American Kennel Club]] sums up the Mastiff breed as:\n:a combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Kennel Club \u2013 Mastiff|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/mastiff/|publisher=The American Kennel Club|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Mastiff pup 4 weeks.jpg|thumb|left|Even at four weeks, a Mastiff should seem massive.]]\nAt all stages of development, the Mastiff should show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement.\nThe Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first two years of the dog's life, in order not to damage the [[growth plate]]s in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5&nbsp;lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog's life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed's large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing.  A [[whelping box]], along with careful monitoring can prevent such accidents.  The average lifespan of the Mastiff is about 7 years although it's not uncommon for some to live to 10\u201311 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastiff.org/HEALTHSURVEYSTATISTICS.htm|title=Health Survey Statistics|publisher=Mastiff Club of America|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623071222/http://www.mastiff.org/HEALTHSURVEYSTATISTICS.htm|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=O'Neill>{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D.

B. Wynn 1885. William Loxley.</ref> when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head [[gamekeeper]] of [[Kirklees Hall]], whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson's grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the [[Bold Hall]] line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from [[narrowboat|canal boat]] men, another caught by Crabtree in a [[Red Fox|fox]] [[Animal trapping|trap]], a dog from [[Nostal priory]] and another dog from [[Walton Hall, West Yorkshire|Walton Hall]], owned by the naturalist, [[Charles Waterton]]. J. W. Thompson's first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer [[Bill George (dog dealer)|Bill George]], to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an [[Alpine Mastiff]] bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|Marquis of Hertford]]. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White's possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson's. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Mastiff Pluto 1830.jpg|thumb|Marquis of Hertford's [[cropped ear|crop-eared]] black Mastiff Pluto (1830)]]\n\nAnother important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The [[Royal Engineers]].<ref>\"The chronicles of the Garniers of Hampshire during four centuries, 1530\u20131900\" (https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofgarn00garn/chroniclesofgarn00garn_djvu.txt)</ref> He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at [[Leadenhall Market]], was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at [[Tattersalls]] and suspected by Garnier of containing a \"dash of Boarhound\", an ancestral form of [[Great Dane]]. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines. (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a [[Scottish Deerhound]], and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and [[Irish Wolfhound]]s.)[[File:Lukey's Governor (Mastiff).jpg|thumb|left|Lukey's Governor, born 1861, a six generation ancestor of Ch. Crown Prince]][[File:Crown Prince.jpg|thumb|left|The controversial Ch. Crown Prince, pictured in old age.]] In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but [[stifle joint|straight-stifled]] and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common.[[File:John Paul \"Four Dogs\".jpg|thumb|[[John Paul (artist)|John Paul]]'s 1867 painting showing a typical mid-19th century longer-headed apricot brindle.]] Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist [[Mark Hanbury Beaufoy]], later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America.[[File:Mastiff Champion Beaufort.jpg|thumb|left|Beaufort, acclaimed 19th century champion, grandson of Crown Prince.]] Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time the [[First World War]] ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain.\n\n===After the First World War===\nIn 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the [[Second World War]] Those who can still be found in modern [[pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s were 12 in number,<ref>(1) Roxbury Boy, (2) Millfold Lass, (3) Buzzard Pride (survived only by Merle's Brunhilda of Lyme Hall, who was in turn survived only by Shanno of Lyme Hall), (4) Gyn of Hammercliffe, (5) Duke of Hellingly, (6) Kathleen of Hellingly, (7) King of Hellingly (survived only by Eric of Altnacraig), (8) Maude of Hellingly, (9) Crusader of Goring (survived only by Blythe of Hampden), (10) Goldhawk Elsie, (11) Broomcourt Nell, (12) Rolanda, ''The History & Management of the Mastiff'', Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004</ref> meaning the North American contribution to the [[gene pool]] after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs.\n\nIn the [[British Isles]] during the Second World War virtually all Mastiff breeding stopped due to the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] of meat. After the war, such puppies as were produced mostly succumbed to [[canine distemper]], for which no vaccine was developed until 1950.<ref name=Pomeroy2008>{{cite journal  | author1 = Pomeroy, L.W. | author2 = Bj\u00f8rnstad, O.N | author3 = Holmes, E.C. | year = 2008 | title = The Evolutionary and Epidemiological Dynamics of the Paramyxoviridae | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 98\u2013106 | doi=10.1007/s00239-007-9040-x | pmid=18217182 | pmc=3334863}}</ref> Only a single bitch puppy produced by the elderly stock that survived the war reached maturity, Nydia of Frithend. Her sire had to be declared a Mastiff by the Kennel Club, as his parentage was unknown, and he was thought by some to be a [[Bullmastiff]].\n\nAfter the war, animals from North America (predominantly from Canada) were imported into Britain. Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant [[giant dog breed|giant breeds]] such as [[Bullmastiff]]s and [[St. Bernard dog|St. Bernards]], with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff. In 1959, a [[Dogue de Bordeaux]], Fidelle de Fenelon, was imported from France to the US, registered as a Mastiff, and became the 16th animal in the post-war gene pool.<ref name=\"B&H\">''The History & Management of the Mastiff'', Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004 {{ISBN|1-929242-11-5}}</ref> Since that time, the breed has gradually been restored in Britain, has reached 28th most popular breed in the US,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |accessdate=13 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archivedate=16 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> and is now found worldwide.\n\n==Famous English Mastiffs==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}\n* \"Carlo\" from \"[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]\", a [[Sherlock Holmes]] short story by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n* \"Chupadogra\" (a.k.a. \"Buster\") is an elderly English Mastiff, voiced by [[Sam Elliott]] in the 2010 film ''[[Marmaduke (film)|Marmaduke]]''.\n* \"Crown Prince\", progenitor of the modern breed, owned by [[psychiatrist]] [[L.

Celecoxib does not usually affect [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]] or [[platelet]] counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses.\n\nPeople with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precaution. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs.\n\n===Allergy===\nCelecoxib contains a [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs.

The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sch\u00f6nthal AH | title = Direct non-cyclooxygenase-2 targets of celecoxib and their potential relevance for cancer therapy | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 97 | issue = 11 | pages = 1465\u20138 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17955049 | pmc = 2360267 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604049 }}</ref>\n\nCertainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with [[malignant tumor]] cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells ''[[in vitro]]'', but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2.<ref name=\"Chuang\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chuang HC, Kardosh A, Gaffney KJ, Petasis NA, Sch\u00f6nthal AH | title = COX-2 inhibition is neither necessary nor sufficient for celecoxib to suppress tumor cell proliferation and focus formation in vitro | journal = Molecular Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 38 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18485224 | pmc = 2396175 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-7-38 }}</ref>\n\nAdditional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib.

However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with [[malignant tumor]] cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells ''[[in vitro]]'', but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2.<ref name=\"Chuang\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chuang HC, Kardosh A, Gaffney KJ, Petasis NA, Sch\u00f6nthal AH | title = COX-2 inhibition is neither necessary nor sufficient for celecoxib to suppress tumor cell proliferation and focus formation in vitro | journal = Molecular Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 38 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18485224 | pmc = 2396175 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-7-38 }}</ref>\n\nAdditional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib.

The meat is shredded and packed into sterile containers covered in fat. Rillettes are most commonly made with pork, but also made with other meats such as [[goose]], [[duck]], [[chicken]], [[game bird]]s, [[rabbit]] and sometimes with [[fish]] such as [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[tuna]] or [[salmon]]. Rillettes are best served at room temperature spread thickly on toasted bread. \n\n[[Sarthe]] ([[Le Mans]]), [[Tours]], and [[Anjou]], all in central France, are notable sources of rillettes.\n\nThe term ''rillette'' perhaps refers to the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty [[pork belly]] or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly over low heat until very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In [[Anjou]],  rillaud was a speciality, plated in the shape of a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.\n[[File:Serving of rillettes.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional serving of rillettes Le Mans with homemade bread and dark chocolate.]]\nLike [[cassoulet]] or [[fondue]], this French dish has its many regional definitions. In general most rillettes are served at room temperature, as a spread with [[toast points]], much like a p\u00e2t\u00e9. Pork rillettes from the northwestern regions of Tours and Anjou are famous for the rich texture and bronze color achieved during the cooking process. [[Rabelais]] called rillettes \"the brown jam from the pig\" (''brune confiture de cochon'').<ref>[[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] also called ''rillettes'' \"brown jam\":  Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, ''Le Lys dans la Vall\u00e9e'' [The lily of the valley] (Paris, France:  Charpentier, 1839), p. 7.

The meat is shredded and packed into sterile containers covered in fat. Rillettes are most commonly made with pork, but also made with other meats such as [[goose]], [[duck]], [[chicken]], [[game bird]]s, [[rabbit]] and sometimes with [[fish]] such as [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[tuna]] or [[salmon]]. Rillettes are best served at room temperature spread thickly on toasted bread. \n\n[[Sarthe]] ([[Le Mans]]), [[Tours]], and [[Anjou]], all in central France, are notable sources of rillettes.\n\nThe term ''rillette'' perhaps refers to the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty [[pork belly]] or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly over low heat until very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In [[Anjou]],  rillaud was a speciality, plated in the shape of a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.\n[[File:Serving of rillettes.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional serving of rillettes Le Mans with homemade bread and dark chocolate.]]\nLike [[cassoulet]] or [[fondue]], this French dish has its many regional definitions. In general most rillettes are served at room temperature, as a spread with [[toast points]], much like a p\u00e2t\u00e9. Pork rillettes from the northwestern regions of Tours and Anjou are famous for the rich texture and bronze color achieved during the cooking process. [[Rabelais]] called rillettes \"the brown jam from the pig\" (''brune confiture de cochon'').<ref>[[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] also called ''rillettes'' \"brown jam\":  Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, ''Le Lys dans la Vall\u00e9e'' [The lily of the valley] (Paris, France:  Charpentier, 1839), p. 7.
