These are all 6 axle, 5100&nbsp;kW engines, produced in a number of over 1000 units between 1967 and 1991. Electroputere (EP) manufactured both the mechanics and electronics of the engines, after mechanics for the engines stopped to be manufactured in Re\u0219i\u021ba, EP took care of the entire manufacturing for these engines and had a yearly output of 150 engines per year. The differences between EA class and EA1 class (classes 40 respectively 41 under the new classification) is that class EA is designed for regular passenger trains and freight trains, being limited to 120&nbsp;km/h whilst the class EA1 is designed for higher speed fast trains with a maximum speed of 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\n[[File:CFR 420 302 (formerly Class 42) at Bucuresti Nord.jpg|thumb|left|The only Class 42 ever built at Gara de Nord. It holds the speed record in Romania (227 km/h in 1997, on Flore\u0219ti Prahova - Buda line). Until soon it was capable of speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/H, but because one of the bearings is worn out, it can only achieve speeds of ~160&nbsp;km/h]]\n\nIn 1974, 060-EA1-122 (later 41-0122-6) was built using experimental 200&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios and used as a test locomotive under the classification of EA2 (thus becoming 060-EA2-122, nicknamed \"The General\" due to this high ranking status). After the experiments proved successful, the axles and gear ratios were transferred to 060-EA2-302 (later 42-0302-2, now 420 302 under the UIC classification) in 1977 and 122 was soon converted into an EA1 machine using 160&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios. 302 soon became the new \"general\", breaking the speed records for Romanian Railways twice, once in 1997 during testing of the Eurofima-based passenger cars on the Flore\u0219ti Prahova-Buda stretch of the Ploie\u0219ti-Bra\u0219ov mainline, and the second time in 2007 on the F\u0103urei ring during testing for Astra Arad passenger cars. In recent years it has been neglected and due to this, one of the bearings is damaged, resulting into the limitation of the speed to 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe design proved to be very successful, and after an agreement in 1970, [[Yugoslav Railways]] decided to buy a number of locomotives that became the J\u017d Series 461 from Electroputere, after CFR also agreed to buy Rade Koncar made locomotives. They were first delivered between 1971 and 1973, and they became so successful, that J\u017d brought a second batch between 1978 and 1980. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, they were passed onto [[Serbian Railways|\u017dS]], [[\u017deljezni\u010dki prevoz Crne Gore|\u017dCG]] and [[M\u017d]]. A number have been modernised, having been turned into 461.2 series (Serbia) and 462 series (Macedonia). Further exports were achieved in 1986 and 1987 when the [[Bulgarian State Railways]] brought another number of units, that were also modernized, becoming the 46.2 series (the original series number being 46). Modernization of these locomotives is done by [[Rade Kon\u010dar Zagreb]], [[REMARUL 16 Februarie Cluj]] and [[RELOC Craiova]].\n\nModernisations for the Romanian Railways' locomotives have been done by different companies, and the first of such concepts appeared in the late 1990s when Siemens (along with a few subcontractors) modernised a few units to [[CFR Class 45]]. The modernisations were a success and the locomotives were hailed as \"Romania's first modern electric locomotives\", produced between 1998 and 2002. Production was stopped though, and only a small number were made, all locomotives numbers beginning with 3xx. They were later rebuilt by Softronic Craiova, and up to this date only 1 unrefurbished locomotive (45-0318-1) runs in regular service, seen mostly on Bucharest-Constan\u021ba mainline. Starting with 2006 and 2007, a number of locomotives were rebuilt by Softronic and PROMAT as [[CFR Class 47]], being a more successful modernisation. Refurbishments are done by SCRL Bra\u0219ov, RELOC, INDA and Softronic Craiova, REMAR Pa\u0219cani and Cluj and PROMAT. From 2020 onwards, RELOC Craiova will begin to modernize more members of the classes, after SOFTRONIC quit modernizing locomotives into Class 47s in 2016.\n\nAside from the exported models to \u017dS and BD\u017d, these locomotives operate in Hungary and Slovakia. A number of examples are operated by [[Magyar Mag\u00e1nvas\u00fat Zrt.]], [[Train Hungary]], [[Prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Foxrail]] and [[Floyd Zrt.]], and are used in regular service in those countries. In 1998, [[Railways of Greece|OSE (Greek Railways)]] hired locomotive 060-EA-056 (manufactured 1968) to operate during the opening of the first electrified Greek railway line from [[Thessaloniki]] to [[Idomeni]]/[[Gevgelija]], and was temporarily used until it was returned to CFR.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab, original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a throttle/[[dynamic brake]] wheel and brake levers, alongside with a knob for the horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tonnes and Hasler Bern [[speedometer]]s (mostly replaced by Softronic IVMS speedometers). Subsequently upgraded versions changed that, with the ICOL cabs featuring a throttle/dynamic brake lever, the dashboard is higher and features an on-board computer, and 2 buttons that remove the horn's ability to use the soft/hard tonnes. Certain modernizations (such as by PROMAT but in lower numbers) maintain the \"wheel\" but have a renovated dashboard, somewhat similar to the CFR Class 46.\n\nInside the machines' hall, electric current enters into the oil-cooled [[transformer]], where its converted from 25 kV AC to 1.5 kV, passing through silicon diode [[rectifier]]s where its converted into DC current for the ASEA LJE 108 [[traction motor]]s. There are also 3 ventilation groups that activate after 5 seconds each; the locomotive can start without the ventilators turned on, but only for shunting. Not using the ventilation on higher traction currents will lead to damage to the traction motors. The traction motors weigh 3,7 tonnes, and with all of them running properly, produce up to 5400kW of hourly power, and 5100kW continuous power. \n\nElectric current is obtained with the help of 2 [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]s and the main switch, type IAC-25. Early models till the mid-1970s had ASEA LLXJN 135 (with one skid plate for 120 km/h of maximum speed and with two skid plates for 160 km/h of maximum speed), but beginning with 1975, locomotives began to be delivered with Faiveley EP1 pantographs, which became a standard factory option from the late 1970s onwards. From the 1990s onwards, Faiveley EP2 and EP3 pantographs became more common, while on certain modernized examples (and for a brief period of time in the late 1990s for EA2 302), use Schunk WBLs, with some examples using Stemmann Technik DSA150s and Schunk WBL-Z (single arm) pantographs. EA1 292 was fitted with experimental Faiveley AX pantographs (typically fitted on SNCF [[SNCF Class BB 36000|Astride]] locomotives) between 1997 and 1998, in order to test them for the upcoming Class 45 modernization program. \n\nThe throttle and dynamic brake controller operates in a similar way to the [[BR Class 86]] tap charger mechanysm, with 40 throttle steps (including the 3 initial shunting positions), plus 3 weakfield positions, all displayed on a gauge. Dynamic braking is controlled in the same way as the throttle is, being activated by moving the wheel leftwards (as opposed to rightwards for throttle), with a limit of ~960A for its operation. All locomotives are fitted with standard dynamic braking, but between 1966 and 1991, one unit was fitted experimentally with [[regenerative braking]], however it was very ineconomical to operate, not to mention dangerous for the locomotive and the catenary. The unit, EB 001, was rebuilt and renumbered into EA 931. \n\n===Notable units===\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, multiple locomotives became easily recognizeable due to their liveries, which was in part, due to the drivers of these locomotives customizing them within the cab and outside. As such, it was common to see locomotives using window curtains, tricolor-painted stripes and various shades of the colors used by CFR at the time. Eventually this \"tradition\" died out when multiple locomotives were refurbished or scrapped, but some train drivers continued it in the 2000s and 2010s, including on modernized Class 47s. Certain locomotives also gained various nicknames, instead of a common nickname for the whole class. \n\n*EA 079 was made by Electroputere in 1979, and in the late 1990s it was refurbished by the same company in order to operate at 15 kV AC, for German railway operator [[Karsdorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft]] (this same operator purchased second-hand locomotives from Romania and the former East Germany). With its bankruptcy, it was stored for years in Germany, until ABB refurbished the locomotive in the mid 2010s in Sweden, looking for potential customers. It eventually entered ownership of GFR after a year, being converted back to 25 kV AC operation.\n*EA1 122 was made by Electroputere in 1974, and painted in a livery that featured a orange stripe instead of the standard red/blue stripe, and it also featured tricolor curtains in the cab. After modernization, the dashboard paneling was painted green, but the locomotive's livery became the standard white with red front ends.\n*EA 127 was made by Electroputere in 1976, and in the 1990s it was painted in a blue and grey livery, similar to the ones fitted on DA diesel locomotives when they arrived from Switzerland in 1959. It was scrapped in 2002 at Ciceu.\n*EA 236 was made by Electroputere in 1975, and is one of the few locomotives to still retain its original livery and pantographs, having been refurbished in April 2018 by SCRL Bra\u0219ov to its almost/original condition.\n*EA1 242 was operated by the Bra\u0219ov train depot, and in the 2000s and early 2010s it was well taken care of by its driver. \n*EA 247 was one of the last \"classical\" locomotives with a tricolor stripe and original Hasler speedometer, in 2013 it was modernized into a Class 47.\n*EA 801 was nicknamed \"Dolly\" by the drivers where it was stabled at, and in 1996 it spotted a livery similar to the DA diesels that operated at the time, but with a \"reversed\" stripe (painted in white) and had a white dashboard aswell.\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|CFR Class 40}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 41}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 42}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rolling stock of Romania}}\n\n[[Category:Passenger locomotives]]\n[[Category:ASEA locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electroputere locomotives]]\n[[Category:Co\u2032Co\u2032 locomotives]]\n[[Category:25 kV AC locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electric locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1965]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{Infobox locomotive\n| name             = Electroputere LE 5100kW <br> CFR 060-EA/EA1/EA2 (pre-1980) <br> CFR Clasa 40/41/42 (post-1980)\n| powertype        = Electric\n| image            = CFR EA 236 at Siculeni.jpg\n| caption          = CFR 400 236, spotting the historic livery, seen at [[Siculeni]]-[[Ciceu]] railway station, getting ready to pull the \"Sz\u00e9kely Gyorsvonat\" towards [[Ghime\u0219]], 20 May 2018\n| imagesize        = 300px\n| designer         = [[ASEA|Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska AB]] , [[NOHAB|Nydqvist & Holm AB]]\n| builder          = [[ASEA]], [[NOHAB]]<br>[[Electroputere Craiova]]\n| builddate        = 1965-1966 ASEA<br> 1967-1991 EP\n| totalproduction  = Class 40-41: 1076 <br> Class 42: 1\n| aarwheels        = C-C\n| uicclass         = [[Co\u2032Co\u2032]]\n| gauge            = {{track gauge|sg}}\n| driverdiameter   = {{convert|1250|mm|ft|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase        = ''Rigid:'' {{convert|4350|mm|ft|2|abbr=on}}<br>''Overall:'' {{convert|10300|mm|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| length           = {{convert|19800|mm|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| width            = {{convert|3000|mm|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| height           = {{convert|4500|mm|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| axleload         = {{convert|20|t|lb|2|abbr=on}}\n| locoweight       = {{convert|120|t|lb|1|abbr=in}}\n| electricsystem   = {{nowrap| [[25 kV AC railway electrification|19.5-27.5]] k[[volt|V]] 50 Hz}} [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Overhead line|Catenary]]\n| collectionmethod = [[Overhead lines|Overhead]] AC with symmetric/asymmetric dual pantographs\n| tractionmotors   = 6\u00d7 {{convert|850|kW|abbr=on}}\n| maxspeed         = {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} Class 40<br> {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} Class 41<br> {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} Class 42\n| poweroutput      = {{convert|5100|kW|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}}\n| tractiveeffort   = {{convert|412|kN|lbf|lk=on|abbr=on}}<br> {{convert|392|kN|lbf|lk=on|abbr=on}}\n| operator         = [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]], [[CFR Marf\u0103]], [[Grup Feroviar Rom\u00e2n|GFR]], [[Servtrans]], [[UNICOM]], [[Transferoviar Grup|TFG]], \n| locale           = [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]]\n| firstrundate     = 9 December 1965\n| lastrundate      =\n}}\n\nThe '''Electroputere LE 5100''', otherwise known as '''CFR Class 40/41/42''' is a class of electric locomotives built for the Romanian Railways (CFR) for use on the Romanian electrified network.

After the experiments proved successful, the axles and gear ratios were transferred to 060-EA2-302 (later 42-0302-2, now 420 302 under the UIC classification) in 1977 and 122 was soon converted into an EA1 machine using 160&nbsp;km/h axles and gear ratios. 302 soon became the new \"general\", breaking the speed records for Romanian Railways twice, once in 1997 during testing of the Eurofima-based passenger cars on the Flore\u0219ti Prahova-Buda stretch of the Ploie\u0219ti-Bra\u0219ov mainline, and the second time in 2007 on the F\u0103urei ring during testing for Astra Arad passenger cars. In recent years it has been neglected and due to this, one of the bearings is damaged, resulting into the limitation of the speed to 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe design proved to be very successful, and after an agreement in 1970, [[Yugoslav Railways]] decided to buy a number of locomotives that became the J\u017d Series 461 from Electroputere, after CFR also agreed to buy Rade Koncar made locomotives. They were first delivered between 1971 and 1973, and they became so successful, that J\u017d brought a second batch between 1978 and 1980. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, they were passed onto [[Serbian Railways|\u017dS]], [[\u017deljezni\u010dki prevoz Crne Gore|\u017dCG]] and [[M\u017d]]. A number have been modernised, having been turned into 461.2 series (Serbia) and 462 series (Macedonia). Further exports were achieved in 1986 and 1987 when the [[Bulgarian State Railways]] brought another number of units, that were also modernized, becoming the 46.2 series (the original series number being 46). Modernization of these locomotives is done by [[Rade Kon\u010dar Zagreb]], [[REMARUL 16 Februarie Cluj]] and [[RELOC Craiova]].\n\nModernisations for the Romanian Railways' locomotives have been done by different companies, and the first of such concepts appeared in the late 1990s when Siemens (along with a few subcontractors) modernised a few units to [[CFR Class 45]]. The modernisations were a success and the locomotives were hailed as \"Romania's first modern electric locomotives\", produced between 1998 and 2002. Production was stopped though, and only a small number were made, all locomotives numbers beginning with 3xx. They were later rebuilt by Softronic Craiova, and up to this date only 1 unrefurbished locomotive (45-0318-1) runs in regular service, seen mostly on Bucharest-Constan\u021ba mainline. Starting with 2006 and 2007, a number of locomotives were rebuilt by Softronic and PROMAT as [[CFR Class 47]], being a more successful modernisation. Refurbishments are done by SCRL Bra\u0219ov, RELOC, INDA and Softronic Craiova, REMAR Pa\u0219cani and Cluj and PROMAT. From 2020 onwards, RELOC Craiova will begin to modernize more members of the classes, after SOFTRONIC quit modernizing locomotives into Class 47s in 2016.\n\nAside from the exported models to \u017dS and BD\u017d, these locomotives operate in Hungary and Slovakia. A number of examples are operated by [[Magyar Mag\u00e1nvas\u00fat Zrt.]], [[Train Hungary]], [[Prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Foxrail]] and [[Floyd Zrt.]], and are used in regular service in those countries. In 1998, [[Railways of Greece|OSE (Greek Railways)]] hired locomotive 060-EA-056 (manufactured 1968) to operate during the opening of the first electrified Greek railway line from [[Thessaloniki]] to [[Idomeni]]/[[Gevgelija]], and was temporarily used until it was returned to CFR.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab, original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a throttle/[[dynamic brake]] wheel and brake levers, alongside with a knob for the horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tonnes and Hasler Bern [[speedometer]]s (mostly replaced by Softronic IVMS speedometers). Subsequently upgraded versions changed that, with the ICOL cabs featuring a throttle/dynamic brake lever, the dashboard is higher and features an on-board computer, and 2 buttons that remove the horn's ability to use the soft/hard tonnes. Certain modernizations (such as by PROMAT but in lower numbers) maintain the \"wheel\" but have a renovated dashboard, somewhat similar to the CFR Class 46.\n\nInside the machines' hall, electric current enters into the oil-cooled [[transformer]], where its converted from 25 kV AC to 1.5 kV, passing through silicon diode [[rectifier]]s where its converted into DC current for the ASEA LJE 108 [[traction motor]]s. There are also 3 ventilation groups that activate after 5 seconds each; the locomotive can start without the ventilators turned on, but only for shunting. Not using the ventilation on higher traction currents will lead to damage to the traction motors. The traction motors weigh 3,7 tonnes, and with all of them running properly, produce up to 5400kW of hourly power, and 5100kW continuous power. \n\nElectric current is obtained with the help of 2 [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]s and the main switch, type IAC-25. Early models till the mid-1970s had ASEA LLXJN 135 (with one skid plate for 120 km/h of maximum speed and with two skid plates for 160 km/h of maximum speed), but beginning with 1975, locomotives began to be delivered with Faiveley EP1 pantographs, which became a standard factory option from the late 1970s onwards. From the 1990s onwards, Faiveley EP2 and EP3 pantographs became more common, while on certain modernized examples (and for a brief period of time in the late 1990s for EA2 302), use Schunk WBLs, with some examples using Stemmann Technik DSA150s and Schunk WBL-Z (single arm) pantographs. EA1 292 was fitted with experimental Faiveley AX pantographs (typically fitted on SNCF [[SNCF Class BB 36000|Astride]] locomotives) between 1997 and 1998, in order to test them for the upcoming Class 45 modernization program. \n\nThe throttle and dynamic brake controller operates in a similar way to the [[BR Class 86]] tap charger mechanysm, with 40 throttle steps (including the 3 initial shunting positions), plus 3 weakfield positions, all displayed on a gauge. Dynamic braking is controlled in the same way as the throttle is, being activated by moving the wheel leftwards (as opposed to rightwards for throttle), with a limit of ~960A for its operation. All locomotives are fitted with standard dynamic braking, but between 1966 and 1991, one unit was fitted experimentally with [[regenerative braking]], however it was very ineconomical to operate, not to mention dangerous for the locomotive and the catenary. The unit, EB 001, was rebuilt and renumbered into EA 931. \n\n==References==\n{{commons category|CFR Class 40}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 41}}\n{{commons category|CFR Class 42}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rolling stock of Romania}}\n\n[[Category:Passenger locomotives]]\n[[Category:ASEA locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electroputere locomotives]]\n[[Category:Co\u2032Co\u2032 locomotives]]\n[[Category:25 kV AC locomotives]]\n[[Category:Electric locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Romania]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1965]]\n", "name_user": "TrainSimFan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroputere_LE5100"}

Naphtha is the root of the word [[naphthalene]], and can also be recognised in the word [[phthalate]], and the paint colour [[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|phthalo blue]].\n\nIn older usage, \"naphtha\" simply meant [[crude oil]], but this usage is now obsolete in English.

{"title_page": "Cyclotomic field", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=September 2012}}\nIn [[number theory]], a '''cyclotomic field''' is a [[number field]] obtained by [[field extension|adjoining]] a [[complex number|complex]] [[primitive root of unity]] to {{math|'''Q'''}}, the field of [[rational number]]s. The {{mvar|n}}-th cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}} (where {{math|''n'' > 2}}) is obtained by adjoining a primitive {{mvar|n}}-th [[root of unity]] {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} to the rational numbers.\n\nThe cyclotomic fields played a crucial role in the development of modern algebra and number theory because of their relation with [[Fermat's last theorem]]. It was in the process of his deep investigations of the arithmetic of these fields (for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;{{mvar|n}})&nbsp;\u2013 and more precisely, because of the failure of [[unique factorization]] in their [[ring of integers|rings of integers]]&nbsp;\u2013 that [[Ernst Kummer]] first introduced the concept of an [[ideal number]] and proved his celebrated [[Kummer's congruences|congruences]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\nA cyclotomic field is the [[splitting field]] of the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]\n\n:<math>\n\\Phi_n(x) =\n\\prod_\\stackrel{1\\le k\\le n}{\\gcd(k,n)=1}\n\\left(x-e^{2i\\pi\\frac{k}{n}}\\right)\n</math>\n\nand therefore it is a [[Galois extension]] of the field of rational numbers. The degree of the extension\n\n:{{math|['''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>):'''Q''']}}\n\nis given by {{math|''\u03c6''(''n'')}} where {{mvar|\u03c6}} is [[Euler's phi function]]. A complete set of Galois conjugates is given by {{math|{\u2009(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a''</sup>\u2009}\u2009}}, where {{mvar|a}} runs over the set of invertible residues modulo&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} (so that {{mvar|a}} is [[relative prime]] to {{mvar|n}}). The [[Galois group]] is [[Natural transformation|naturally isomorphic]] to the multiplicative group\n\n: {{math|('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>\u00d7</sup>}}\n\nof invertible residues modulo {{mvar|n}}, and it acts on the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity by the formula\n\n: {{math|''b'': (\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a''</sup> \u2192 (\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a\u2009b''</sup>}}.\n\nThe [[Discriminant of an algebraic number field|discriminant]] of the extension is<ref>Proposition 2.7 of {{harvnb|Washington|1997}}</ref>\n:: <math>(-1)^{\\varphi(n)/2} \\frac{n^{\\varphi(n)}}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{p|n} p^{\\varphi(n)/(p-1)}},</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi(n)</math> is [[Euler's totient function]].\n\nThe [[ring of integers]] of the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is {{math|'''Z'''[\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.\n\n== Relation with regular polygons ==\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made early inroads in the theory of cyclotomic fields, in connection with the geometrical problem of [[Constructible polygon|constructing]] a [[regular polygon|regular {{mvar|n}}-gon]] with a [[compass and straightedge]]. His surprising result that had escaped his predecessors was that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (with 17&nbsp;sides) could be so constructed. More generally, if {{mvar|p}} is a prime number, then a regular {{mvar|p}}-gon can be constructed if and only if {{mvar|p}} is a [[Fermat prime]]; in other words if <math>\\varphi(p)=p-1=2^k</math> is a [[power of 2]].\n\nFor {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 6}} primitive roots of unity admit a simple expression via [[square root of three]], namely:\n: {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>3</sub> = }}&nbsp;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}{{math|\u2009''i''}} \u2212 1|2}}, &nbsp; {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>6</sub> = }}&nbsp;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}{{math|\u2009''i''}} + 1|2}}\nHence, both corresponding cyclotomic fields are identical to the [[quadratic field]]&nbsp;'''Q'''({{sqrt|\u22123}}). In the case of {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>4</sub> = ''i'' = }}&nbsp;{{sqrt|\u22121}} the identity of {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>4</sub>)}} to a quadratic field is even more obvious. However, this is not the case for {{math|1=''n'' = 5}}, because expressing fifth roots of unity [[Regular pentagon#Verification|requires square roots of square root expressions]], or a quadratic extension of a quadratic extension.<!-- Why are there no other cyclotomic fields identical to a quadratic field? --> The geometric problem for a general {{mvar|n}} can be reduced to the following question in [[Galois theory]]: can the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic field be built as a sequence of quadratic extensions?\n\n== Relation with Fermat's Last Theorem ==\n\nA natural approach to proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is to factor the binomial {{math|''x<sup>n</sup>'' + ''y<sup>n</sup>''}},\nwhere {{mvar|n}} is an [[odd number|odd]] prime, appearing in one side of Fermat's equation\n\n: <math> x^n + y^n = z^n </math>\n\nas follows:\n\n: <math> x^n + y^n = (x + y)(x + \\zeta y)\\cdots (x + \\zeta^{n-1} y) </math>\n\nHere {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are ordinary integers, whereas the factors are algebraic integers in the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b6''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}. If [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization]] of algebraic integers were true, then it could have been used to rule out the existence of nontrivial solutions to Fermat's equation.\n\nSeveral attempts to tackle Fermat's Last Theorem proceeded along these lines, and both Fermat's proof for {{math|1=''n'' = 4}} and Euler's proof for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} can be recast in these terms. The complete list of ''n'' for which the field has unique factorization is:<ref>{{cite book | last=Washington | first=Lawrence C. | authorlink=Lawrence C.

He introduced a replacement for the prime numbers in the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b6''<sub>''p''</sub>)}}, expressed the failure of unique factorization quantitatively via the [[class number (number theory)|class number]] {{math|''h<sub>p</sub>''}} and proved that if {{math|''h<sub>p</sub>''}} is not divisible by {{mvar|p}} (such numbers {{mvar|p}} are called ''[[regular prime]]s'') then Fermat's theorem is true for the exponent {{math|1=''n'' = ''p''}}. Furthermore, he [[Kummer's criterion|gave a criterion]] to determine which primes are regular and using it, established Fermat's theorem for all prime exponents {{mvar|p}} less than 100, with the exception of the ''irregular primes'' [[37 (number)|37]], [[59 (number)|59]], and [[67 (number)|67]].

Ser a (2016)\n[[Category:Algebraic number theory]]\n[[Category:Cyclotomic fields|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=September 2012}}\nIn [[number theory]], a '''cyclotomic field''' is a [[number field]] obtained by [[field extension|adjoining]] a [[complex number|complex]] [[primitive root of unity]] to {{math|'''Q'''}}, the field of [[rational number]]s. The {{mvar|n}}-th cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}} (where {{math|''n'' > 2}}) is obtained by adjoining a primitive {{mvar|n}}-th [[root of unity]] {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} to the rational numbers.\n\nThe cyclotomic fields played a crucial role in the development of modern algebra and number theory because of their relation with [[Fermat's last theorem]]. It was in the process of his deep investigations of the arithmetic of these fields (for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;{{mvar|n}})&nbsp;\u2013 and more precisely, because of the failure of [[unique factorization]] in their [[ring of integers|rings of integers]]&nbsp;\u2013 that [[Ernst Kummer]] first introduced the concept of an [[ideal number]] and proved his celebrated [[Kummer's congruences|congruences]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\nA cyclotomic field is the [[splitting field]] of the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]\n\n:<math>\n\\Phi_n(x) =\n\\prod_\\stackrel{1\\le k\\le n}{\\gcd(k,n)=1}\n\\left(x-e^{2i\\pi\\frac{k}{n}}\\right)\n</math>\n\nand therefore it is a [[Galois extension]] of the field of rational numbers. The degree of the extension\n\n:{{math|['''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>):'''Q''']}}\n\nis given by {{math|''\u03c6''(''n'')}} where {{mvar|\u03c6}} is [[Euler's phi function]]. A complete set of Galois conjugates is given by {{math|{\u2009(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a''</sup>\u2009}\u2009}}, where {{mvar|a}} runs over the set of invertible residues modulo&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} (so that {{mvar|a}} is [[relative prime]] to {{mvar|n}}). The [[Galois group]] is [[Natural transformation|naturally isomorphic]] to the multiplicative group\n\n: {{math|('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>\u00d7</sup>}}\n\nof invertible residues modulo {{mvar|n}}, and it acts on the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity by the formula\n\n: {{math|''b'': (\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a''</sup> \u2192 (\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''a\u2009b''</sup>}}.\n\nThe [[Discriminant of an algebraic number field|discriminant]] of the extension is<ref>Proposition 2.7 of {{harvnb|Washington|1997}}</ref>\n:: <math>(-1)^{\\varphi(n)/2} \\frac{n^{\\varphi(n)}}{\\displaystyle\\prod_{p|n} p^{\\varphi(n)/(p-1)}},</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi(n)</math> is [[Euler's totient function]].\n\nThe [[ring of integers]] of the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is {{math|'''Z'''[\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.\n\n== Relation with regular polygons ==\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made early inroads in the theory of cyclotomic fields, in connection with the geometrical problem of [[Constructible polygon|constructing]] a [[regular polygon|regular {{mvar|n}}-gon]] with a [[compass and straightedge]]. His surprising result that had escaped his predecessors was that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (with 17&nbsp;sides) could be so constructed. More generally, if {{mvar|p}} is a prime number, then a regular {{mvar|p}}-gon can be constructed if and only if {{mvar|p}} is a [[Fermat prime]]; in other words if <math>\\varphi(p)=p-1=2^k</math> is a [[power of 2]].\n\nFor {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 6}} primitive roots of unity admit a simple expression via [[square root of three]], namely:\n: {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>3</sub> = }}&nbsp;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}{{math|\u2009''i''}} \u2212 1|2}}, &nbsp; {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>6</sub> = }}&nbsp;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}{{math|\u2009''i''}} + 1|2}}\nHence, both corresponding cyclotomic fields are identical to the [[quadratic field]]&nbsp;'''Q'''({{sqrt|\u22123}}). In the case of {{math|1=\u03b6<sub>4</sub> = ''i'' = }}&nbsp;{{sqrt|\u22121}} the identity of {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>4</sub>)}} to a quadratic field is even more obvious. However, this is not the case for {{math|1=''n'' = 5}}, because expressing fifth roots of unity [[Regular pentagon#Verification|requires square roots of square root expressions]], or a quadratic extension of a quadratic extension.<!-- Why are there no other cyclotomic fields identical to a quadratic field? --> The geometric problem for a general {{mvar|n}} can be reduced to the following question in [[Galois theory]]: can the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic field be built as a sequence of quadratic extensions?\n\n== Relation with Fermat's Last Theorem ==\n\nA natural approach to proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is to factor the binomial {{math|''x<sup>n</sup>'' + ''y<sup>n</sup>''}},\nwhere {{mvar|n}} is an [[odd number|odd]] prime, appearing in one side of Fermat's equation\n\n: <math> x^n + y^n = z^n </math>\n\nas follows:\n\n: <math> x^n + y^n = (x + y)(x + \\zeta y)\\cdots (x + \\zeta^{n-1} y) </math>\n\nHere {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are ordinary integers, whereas the factors are algebraic integers in the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b6''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}. If [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization]] of algebraic integers were true, then it could have been used to rule out the existence of nontrivial solutions to Fermat's equation.\n\nSeveral attempts to tackle Fermat's Last Theorem proceeded along these lines, and both Fermat's proof for {{math|1=''n'' = 4}} and Euler's proof for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} can be recast in these terms. The complete list of ''n'' for which the field has unique factorization is:<ref>{{cite book | last=Washington | first=Lawrence C. | authorlink=Lawrence C.

He introduced a replacement for the prime numbers in the cyclotomic field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b6''<sub>''p''</sub>)}}, expressed the failure of unique factorization quantitatively via the [[class number (number theory)|class number]] {{math|''h<sub>p</sub>''}} and proved that if {{math|''h<sub>p</sub>''}} is not divisible by {{mvar|p}} (such numbers {{mvar|p}} are called ''[[regular prime]]s'') then Fermat's theorem is true for the exponent {{math|1=''n'' = ''p''}}. Furthermore, he [[Kummer's criterion|gave a criterion]] to determine which primes are regular and using it, established Fermat's theorem for all prime exponents {{mvar|p}} less than 100, with the exception of the ''irregular primes'' [[37 (number)|37]], [[59 (number)|59]], and [[67 (number)|67]].

The major issues related to security, when attendees arrived, left or returned to the site, and the official concert food-beverage-vendor policy initially restricting attendees from entering with supplies of food, drinks and above all, alcohol. With the concert site mostly enclosed by simple chain link fences, there was hardly any difficulty for many attendees to enter freely with beer and other banned items. The security staff, along with the entrance and exit staff, could not continue reasonable monitoring of increasingly vast numbers entering, exiting, inspecting, while at the same time maintaining safety, security and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe festival was followed by [[Woodstock 1999]], also in New York at [[Rome, New York|Rome]].\n\n==Performers and notable events during the festival==\n===Friday, August 12===\n====North Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* Roguish Armament with Rekk<ref>https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-32888484/peace-love-roguish-armament-oh-well-woodstock</ref>\n* Master of None\n* [[3 (American band)|3]]\n* Futu Futu\n* Abba Rage\n* Lunchmeat\n* The Paul Luke Band\n* Peacebomb\n* [[The Goats]]\n* [[Huffamoose]]\n* [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]]\n* [[Blues Traveler]]\n* [[Jackyl]]\n* [[Del Amitri]]\n* [[Live (band)|Live]]\n* [[James (band)|James]]\n* [[King's X]]\n* [[Sheryl Crow]]\n* [[Collective Soul]]\n* [[Candlebox]]\n* [[Violent Femmes]]<ref>http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222016_1_woodstock-sheryl-crow-special-events/2</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Ravestock====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aphex Twin]]\n* [[Deee-Lite]]\n* [[DJ Spooky]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicandart.net/images/dj_spooky/press/Some.pdf |title=Paul D.

Lead singer, [[Jesse James Dupree]], took the stage with a bottle of whiskey and poured alcohol onto the crowd. He then started smoking [[marijuana]] and on a close up he shotgunned the joint into the camera with copious amounts of smoke filling the screens and the stage. At this point the crowd roared and in within a few minutes the entire crowd was drinking and partying hard. The lead singer then lit a stool on fire in the center of the stage and started using a chain saw to cut it up. He also pulled out a rifle and started shooting it in the air but cut his hand or finger, which started bleeding heavily and as he wiped his forehead a streak of blood was left across his head. At this point security dragged him off the stage. Jackyl turned in one of the most acclaimed performances at the festival, and the resulting double album \u2018Woodstock 94\u2019 went platinum and included \"Headed For Destruction\" (a track from ''Push Comes To Shove'').\n* [[Aphex Twin]]'s performance was cut short when promoters \"disconnected\" him mid-show for signing a fake name on a contract, which would forfeit [[PolyGram]]'s rights to his performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/rollingstoneravestock.htm|title=Al Weisel \u2013 Ravestock at Woodstock '94}}</ref>\n\n===Saturday, August 13===\n====North Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Joe Cocker]]\n* [[Blind Melon]]\n* [[Cypress Hill]]\n* [[Rollins Band]]\n* [[Melissa Etheridge]]\n* [[Crosby, Stills, & Nash]] featuring [[John Sebastian]]\n* [[Nine Inch Nails]]\n* [[Metallica]]\n* [[Aerosmith]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====South Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Nenad Bach]]<ref>[http://nenadbach.blogspot.com/2010/02/memory-lane-woodstock-festival.html Everything Is Forever \u2013 Nenad Bach]</ref>\n* [[The Cranberries]]\n* [[Zucchero]]\n* [[Youssou N'Dour]]\n* [[The Band]] featuring [[Hot Tuna]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Rob Wasserman]], and [[Bob Weir]]\n* [[Primus (band)|Primus]] featuring [[Jerry Cantrell]]\n* [[Salt 'N Pepa]]\n*[[VINX]] as MC{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Notable events: Day 2 ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-classic-drugged-out-performances-from-santana-to-green-day-20130606/3-blind-melon-at-woodstock-1994-lsd-0894598|title=Dazed and Confused: 10 Classic Drugged-Out Shows, Blind Melon at Woodstock, 1994 \u2013 LSD|website=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=2015-10-21}}</ref>\n* [[Nine Inch Nails]] had the largest crowd density at the event, overshadowing many of the other performers.

This culminated with [[Green Day]]'s performance, during which guitarist and lead vocalist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] started a mudfight during their song, \u201c[[Paper Lanterns (Green Day song)|Paper Lanterns]]\u201d, with the crowd. In the documentary [[Behind The Music|VH1 Behind the Music: Green Day]], bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] was mistaken for one of the fans jumping on stage, and was spear-tackled by a security guard, knocking out one of his teeth. It was this incident that caused Dirnt to need emergency orthodontia. A gag order was put in place<!-- against who? for what? --> regarding this incident. In spite of the now-famous mud-fight and Dirnt's injury, Woodstock quickly propelled Green Day's then recently released album, ''[[Dookie]]'', into success.\n* After being injured in a traffic accident in 1966, and his subsequent disappearance from the popular music scene, [[Bob Dylan]] declined to go to the original Woodstock Festival of 1969, even though he lived in the area at the time and the festival had been put in his backyard to try to get him to come out and play. He set off for the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] the day the Woodstock festival started, and performed at Woodside Bay on 31 August 1969. Dylan, however, did accept an invitation to perform at Woodstock '94, and was introduced with the phrase: \"We waited twenty-five years to hear this. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Dylan\".<ref>veoh.com: ''[http://www.veoh.com/collection/classicsrock/watch/v17133221JTTxdhTn Bob Dylan Woodstock '94]''</ref> According to various critics, Dylan's performance was one of the greater moments of the festival, and represented the beginning of another new phase in his lengthy career.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Dylan, often in this show, played lead guitar and hard electric rock\n* The [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] performed in lightbulb costumes for the first song of their set.

The major issues related to security, when attendees arrived, left or returned to the site, and the official concert food-beverage-vendor policy initially restricting attendees from entering with supplies of food, drinks and above all, alcohol. With the concert site mostly enclosed by simple chain link fences, there was hardly any difficulty for many attendees to enter freely with beer and other banned items. The security staff, along with the entrance and exit staff, could not continue reasonable monitoring of increasingly vast numbers entering, exiting, inspecting, while at the same time maintaining safety, security and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe festival was followed by [[Woodstock 1999]], also in New York at [[Rome, New York|Rome]].\n\n==Performers and notable events during the festival==\n===Friday, August 12===\n====North Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* Roguish Armament with Rekk<ref>https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-32888484/peace-love-roguish-armament-oh-well-woodstock</ref>\n* Master of None\n* [[3 (American band)|3]]\n* Futu Futu\n* Abba Rage\n* Lunchmeat\n* The Paul Luke Band\n* Peacebomb\n* [[The Goats]]\n* [[Huffamoose]]\n* [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]]\n* [[Blues Traveler]]\n* [[Jackyl]]\n* [[Del Amitri]]\n* [[Live (band)|Live]]\n* [[James (band)|James]]\n* [[King's X]]\n* [[Sheryl Crow]]\n* [[Collective Soul]]\n* [[Candlebox]]\n* [[Violent Femmes]]<ref>http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-10/features/1994222016_1_woodstock-sheryl-crow-special-events/2</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Ravestock====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aphex Twin]]\n* [[Deee-Lite]]\n* [[DJ Spooky]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicandart.net/images/dj_spooky/press/Some.pdf |title=Paul D.

Lead singer, [[Jesse James Dupree]], took the stage with a bottle of whiskey and poured alcohol onto the crowd. He then started smoking [[marijuana]] and on a close up he shotgunned the joint into the camera with copious amounts of smoke filling the screens and the stage. At this point the crowd roared and in within a few minutes the entire crowd was drinking and partying hard. The lead singer then lit a stool on fire in the center of the stage and started using a chain saw to cut it up. He also pulled out a rifle and started shooting it in the air but cut his hand or finger, which started bleeding heavily and as he wiped his forehead a streak of blood was left across his head. At this point security dragged him off the stage. Jackyl turned in one of the most acclaimed performances at the festival, and the resulting double album \u2018Woodstock 94\u2019 went platinum and included \"Headed For Destruction\" (a track from ''Push Comes To Shove'').\n* [[Aphex Twin]]'s performance was cut short when promoters \"disconnected\" him mid-show for signing a fake name on a contract, which would forfeit [[PolyGram]]'s rights to his performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/rollingstoneravestock.htm|title=Al Weisel \u2013 Ravestock at Woodstock '94}}</ref>\n\n===Saturday, August 13===\n====North Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Joe Cocker]]\n* [[Blind Melon]]\n* [[Cypress Hill]]\n* [[Rollins Band]]\n* [[Melissa Etheridge]]\n* [[Crosby, Stills, & Nash]] featuring [[John Sebastian]]\n* [[Nine Inch Nails]]\n* [[Metallica]]\n* [[Aerosmith]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====South Stage====\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Nenad Bach]]<ref>[http://nenadbach.blogspot.com/2010/02/memory-lane-woodstock-festival.html Everything Is Forever \u2013 Nenad Bach]</ref>\n* [[The Cranberries]]\n* [[Zucchero]]\n* [[Youssou N'Dour]]\n* [[The Band]] featuring [[Hot Tuna]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Rob Wasserman]], and [[Bob Weir]]\n* [[Primus (band)|Primus]] featuring [[Jerry Cantrell]]\n* [[Salt 'N Pepa]]\n*[[VINX]] as MC{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Notable events: Day 2 ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-classic-drugged-out-performances-from-santana-to-green-day-20130606/3-blind-melon-at-woodstock-1994-lsd-0894598|title=Dazed and Confused: 10 Classic Drugged-Out Shows, Blind Melon at Woodstock, 1994 \u2013 LSD|website=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=2015-10-21}}</ref>\n* [[Nine Inch Nails]] had the largest crowd density at the event, overshadowing many of the other performers.

This culminated with [[Green Day]]'s performance, during which guitarist and lead vocalist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] started a mudfight during their song, \u201c[[Paper Lanterns (Green Day song)|Paper Lanterns]]\u201d, with the crowd. In the documentary [[Behind The Music|VH1 Behind the Music: Green Day]], bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] was mistaken for one of the fans jumping on stage, and was spear-tackled by a security guard, knocking out one of his teeth. It was this incident that caused Dirnt to need emergency orthodontia. A gag order was put in place<!-- against who? for what? --> regarding this incident. In spite of the now-famous mud-fight and Dirnt's injury, Woodstock quickly propelled Green Day's then recently released album, ''[[Dookie]]'', into success.\n* After being injured in a traffic accident in 1966, and his subsequent disappearance from the popular music scene, [[Bob Dylan]] declined to go to the original Woodstock Festival of 1969, even though he lived in the area at the time and the festival had been put in his backyard to try to get him to come out and play. He set off for the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] the day the Woodstock festival started, and performed at Woodside Bay on 31 August 1969. Dylan, however, did accept an invitation to perform at Woodstock '94, and was introduced with the phrase: \"We waited twenty-five years to hear this. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Dylan\".<ref>veoh.com: ''[http://www.veoh.com/collection/classicsrock/watch/v17133221JTTxdhTn Bob Dylan Woodstock '94]''</ref> According to various critics, Dylan's performance was one of the greater moments of the festival, and represented the beginning of another new phase in his lengthy career.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Dylan, often in this show, played lead guitar and hard electric rock\n* The [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] performed in lightbulb costumes for the first song of their set.

Additionally, [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and [[Jack Casady]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]]/[[Hot Tuna]], and [[Bob Weir]] of the [[Grateful Dead]], all Woodstock alumni, also appeared, performing with the Band on guitar, bass, and guitar and vocals, respectively.\n\n=== Declined invitations or missed connections ===\n*[[Guns N' Roses]] were asked to appear at the festival, but the band declined due to internal problems as well as feeling the concert was too 'commercial.' However, lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] made an appearance with Paul Rodgers.\n*Rumors circulated during the festival that [[The Rolling Stones]] were to make a surprise appearance because they were scheduled to play a concert in New York that weekend.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n*[[Johnny Cash]], the only living person at that time to be inducted into both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], was also invited to perform, but after learning that he would not be performing on the main stage, declined to appear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n*[[Alice in Chains]] were on the initial bill of the festival.

Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week.

The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man.

Shortly after they met, Icke left home following one of a number of frequent arguments he had started having with his father.

Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93\u201395, 99\u2013100.</ref> He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.</ref>\n\nIcke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.</ref> His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short-lived\u2014he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him\u2014but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.</ref> Icke was by then a household name, but has said that a career in television began to lose its appeal to him; he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.<ref>Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.</ref> \n\nIn August 1990 his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the \"poll tax\"), a local tax [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government introduced that year.

Frost had no prior acting experience and she began working with an acting coach. She filmed her first scenes in August 2017, and she made her first appearance during the season finale broadcast on 18 December 2017. Jasmine's introductory scenes see her involved in a car crash, which kills [[Kat Chapman]] ([[Pia Miller]]).\n\nJasmine is portrayed as a naive, trusting, kind \"spirited Aussie girl\".<ref name=\"SM\"/> As the character was introduced alone, producers gave her a connection to the community through [[Leah Patterson]] ([[Ada Nicodemou]]), who Jasmine quickly befriends. The character's first storyline saw the arrival of her abusive former boyfriend [[List of Home and Away characters (2018)#David|David]] (Jack Ellis), who has been stalking her. David's presence scares Jasmine and when he loses his temper, he holds her and Leah hostage. Frost said the storyline was challenging for her. Later storylines have focused on Jasmine's romantic relationships with [[Mason Morgan]] ([[Orpheus Pledger]]), [[Colby Thorne]] (Tim Franklin) and [[Robbo (Home and Away)|Robbo]] ([[Jake Ryan (actor)|Jake Ryan]]), to whom she became engaged to.\n\nFrost's casting attracted criticism from individuals in the acting community, but she was defended by current and former ''Home and Away'' stars. She also received death threats on social media from fans who were unhappy that her character was involved in Kat's death.

Frost was asked to audition for the serial while she was competing on ''[[Hell's Kitchen Australia]]''. After seeing that she was up against several actresses, Frost did not think she would be successful. Following a second audition, Frost was told she had won the role. Frost had no prior acting experience and she began working with an acting coach. She filmed her first scenes in August 2017, and she made her first appearance during the season finale broadcast on 18 December 2017. Jasmine's introductory scenes see her involved in a car crash, which kills [[Kat Chapman]] ([[Pia Miller]]).\n\nJasmine is portrayed as a naive, trusting, kind \"spirited Aussie girl\".<ref name=\"SM\"/> As the character was introduced alone, producers gave her a connection to the community through [[Leah Patterson]] ([[Ada Nicodemou]]), who Jasmine quickly befriends. The character's first storyline saw the arrival of her abusive former boyfriend [[List of Home and Away characters (2018)#David|David]] (Jack Ellis), who has been stalking her. David's presence scares Jasmine and when he loses his temper, he holds her and Leah hostage. Frost said the storyline was challenging for her. Later storylines have focused on Jasmine's romantic relationships with [[Mason Morgan]] ([[Orpheus Pledger]]), [[Colby Thorne]] (Tim Franklin) and [[Robbo (Home and Away)|Robbo]] ([[Jake Ryan (actor)|Jake Ryan]]), to whom she became engaged to.\n\nFrost's casting attracted criticism from individuals in the acting community, but she was defended by current and former ''Home and Away'' stars. She also received death threats on social media from fans who were unhappy that her character was involved in Kat's death. Frost later received a nomination for the [[Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent]] for the role.\n\n==Casting==\nOn 17 July 2017, Karlie Rutherford of ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that television personality Sam Frost had been cast in ''Home and Away''.<ref name=\"Rutherford\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/sam-frost-joins-home-and-away-cast-after-the-abrupt-end-to-her-radio-show-im-so-excited/news-story/8faa9c21bfcb5186584854bd516cbf09?nk=cfb429b18655ca0e93ccfee99540e4e4-1500336327|title=Sam Frost joins Home and Away cast after the abrupt end to her radio show: 'I'm so excited'|last=Rutherford|first=Karlie|date=17 July 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=18 December 2017}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Frost, who had no prior acting experience, was asked to audition for the show while she was a contestant on ''[[Hell's Kitchen Australia]]'', which airs on the same network.

Though he started off with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', and ''[[Nurse Betty]]'', he went on to star in films like ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]'', and  ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]''.

Kamau Bell]]'', which premiered in August 2012.\n\n===Academy Awards===\nIn early 2005, Rock hosted the [[77th Academy Awards]] ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an \"edge\" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''\"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!\"'' During one segment Rock asked, \"Who is this guy?\" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: \"If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!\"). Subsequently, an angry [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, \"In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.\" (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.) Law was not the only actor that Rock [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] that evening, however\u2014he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, \"If you want [[Denzel Washington|Denzel]] [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!\" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113094616/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|url-status=dead|title=Chris Rock effect fails to boost Oscars|date=March 2, 2005|archivedate=November 13, 2012|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as \"idiotic\", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/hey-chris-rock-shut-bleep-wbna6849862|title=Hey, Chris Rock: Shut the [bleep] up|date=February 3, 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923063025/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|url-status=dead|title=\"Chris Rock, Oscars host, slams Oscars\"; ''Sydney Morning Herald''/Reuters; February 16, 2005|archivedate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 2015 the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] announced Rock would host the [[88th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34591581|title=Chris Rock to host 2016 Oscars|work=BBC News}}</ref> When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony.

Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] (an [[Italian Americans|Italian]]-ethnic neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has criticized Rock both explicitly\u2014for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] routine\u2014and implicitly, for use of the word \"[[nigger]].\"<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. \"Bill Cosby to Blacks,\" July 2, 2004. \"When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car\u2014those children hear that... That's all [[minstrel show]] stuff. I am tired of it.\"</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects [[Caucasian race|whites]] to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"<ref>Rock, Chris.

Though he started off with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', and ''[[Nurse Betty]]'', he went on to star in films like ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]'', and  ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]''.

Kamau Bell]]'', which premiered in August 2012.\n\n===Academy Awards===\nIn early 2005, Rock hosted the [[77th Academy Awards]] ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an \"edge\" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''\"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!\"'' During one segment Rock asked, \"Who is this guy?\" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: \"If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!\"). Subsequently, an angry [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, \"In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.\" (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.) Law was not the only actor that Rock [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] that evening, however\u2014he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, \"If you want [[Denzel Washington|Denzel]] [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!\" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113094616/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|url-status=dead|title=Chris Rock effect fails to boost Oscars|date=March 2, 2005|archivedate=November 13, 2012|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as \"idiotic\", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/hey-chris-rock-shut-bleep-wbna6849862|title=Hey, Chris Rock: Shut the [bleep] up|date=February 3, 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923063025/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|url-status=dead|title=\"Chris Rock, Oscars host, slams Oscars\"; ''Sydney Morning Herald''/Reuters; February 16, 2005|archivedate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 2015 the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] announced Rock would host the [[88th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34591581|title=Chris Rock to host 2016 Oscars|work=BBC News}}</ref> When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony.

Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] (an [[Italian Americans|Italian]]-ethnic neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has criticized Rock both explicitly\u2014for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] routine\u2014and implicitly, for use of the word \"[[nigger]].\"<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. \"Bill Cosby to Blacks,\" July 2, 2004. \"When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car\u2014those children hear that... That's all [[minstrel show]] stuff. I am tired of it.\"</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects [[Caucasian race|whites]] to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"<ref>Rock, Chris.

Blige became the first person to ever be nominated for an acting and song award during the same year.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Mississippi delta farm country, Henry McAllan and his younger brother Jamie dig a grave and struggle to lower their deceased Pappy's coffin into it. When the Jacksons, a black sharecropper family, pass by in a wagon, Henry asks the father, Hap, for help. Henry seems uncomfortable asking; Hap hesitates to reply.\n\nThe film goes back to 1939, when Henry buys a farm outside the fictional town of Marietta, Mississippi, in the [[Mississippi Delta]], and moves there with his wife Laura, with whom he shares a passionless marriage, their daughters, and the virulently racist Pappy. The Jackson family, led by tenant farmer Hap and his wife Florence, work the farm's cotton field and dream of owning their own land one day.\n\nAs World War II begins, Jamie and the Jacksons' eldest son, Ronsel, join the Air Force and Army, respectively. Jamie flys bombers and Ronsel commands tanks and falls in love with a white German woman. Both experience severe combat trauma. \n\nMeanwhile, back in Mississippi both families live in poverty, at the edge of disaster. The families support each other out of necessity. The Jacksons' mule has to be put down. Henry offers to share his mule, but exacts half of the Jackson's crop in payment; the Jacksons have no choice but to accept. Florence helps Laura when Laura and Henry's two small daughters are ill with whooping cough, and Laura offers Florence work helping care for her daughters. Hap, who serves as the preacher for the local black community, falls while helping to build a small church, breaking a leg and rendering him unable to work. Laura sneaks money from her husband's safe so Hap can be treated by a doctor.\n\nWhen the war ends, Ronsel and Jamie return home and realize that they've changed, but the local society hasn't. Jamie becomes an alcoholic and suffers from PTSD. Ronsel, accustomed to the relative lack of racism among Europeans, struggles with racism back home. They become aware of each others' difficulties and bond over their war experiences. Ronsel asks why Jamie treats him with respect; Jamie recounts that on a bomber flight, a black fighter pilot saved his life. Jamie's drunkenness gets worse and he wakes up from a nightmare  with the car partially submerged in a lake. Henry leaves on a trip and tells Jamie to leave the farm before he returns.\n\nRonsel receives a letter from the German woman with whom he'd been romantically involved during the war. He learns that they had a child together and she wants Ronsel to join them. He shares this with Jamie while riding together in the McAllans' truck. Their truck passes Pappy and Ronsel must hide. Pappy confronts Jamie about seeing him with Rondel. He yells at Jamie for his drunken behavior and sneers at Laura, claiming she has feelings for Jamie. Later, Ronsel realizes that he lost the letter and photo and runs out to look for it. Pappy finds the letter and photo in the truck. Laura confronts Jamie as he packs to leave, and they make love. \n\nAs Ronsel searches for his letter, he is ambushed by Pappy and members of the Ku Klux Klan and beaten. Pappy brings Jamie to a barn where the Klan is preparing to kill Ronsel for fathering a child with a white woman. Jamie points a gun at his father in an effort to save his friend, and is beaten by members of the Klan. As Jamie is restrained and in pain, he is told to choose Ronsel's punishment for his crime -- to lose his eyes, tongue or testicles -- or watch Ronsel be put to death. Through the pain, Jamie whispers \"tongue\" and Ronsel's tongue is cut out. Ronsel is left bound and wounded for his family to find. \n\nLater that night, Jamie wakes Pappy. Pappy had previously belittled Jamie's war awards because he hadn't had to look in the eyes of the people he killed. Jamie looks Pappy in the eye and smothers him with a pillow.\n\nThe film returns to the opening scene. The Jacksons appear to be leaving with their meager belongings in the wagon. Hap accedes to Henry's request to help with the coffin and says a prayer over the grave. In a rebuke to Pappy, Hap recites from the Book of Job, verses 14:2-12. As Henry begins to bury his father, Jamie walks away. He approaches the Jacksons' wagon and gives the German woman's envelope to Florence, asking her to give it to Ronsel if she should see him. \n\nMuch later, Jamie moves to the city. Ronsel makes his way back to Europe and reunites with the German woman and his son.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- Per end credits --->\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Laura McAllan (n\u00e9e Chappell)\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Henry McAllan\n* [[Mary J.

Blige became the first person to ever be nominated for an acting and song award during the same year.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Mississippi delta farm country, Henry McAllan and his younger brother Jamie dig a grave and struggle to lower their deceased Pappy's coffin into it. When the Jacksons, a black sharecropper family, pass by in a wagon, Henry asks the father, Hap, for help. Henry seems uncomfortable asking; Hap hesitates to reply.\n\nThe film goes back to 1939, when Henry buys a farm outside the fictional town of Marietta, Mississippi, in the [[Mississippi Delta]], and moves there with his wife Laura, with whom he shares a passionless marriage, their daughters, and the virulently racist Pappy. The Jackson family, led by tenant farmer Hap and his wife Florence, work the farm's cotton field and dream of owning their own land one day.\n\nAs World War II begins, Jamie and the Jacksons' eldest son, Ronsel, join the Air Force and Army, respectively. Jamie flys bombers and Ronsel commands tanks and falls in love with a white German woman. Both experience severe combat trauma. \n\nMeanwhile, back in Mississippi both families live in poverty, at the edge of disaster. The families support each other out of necessity. The Jacksons' mule has to be put down. Henry offers to share his mule, but exacts half of the Jackson's crop in payment; the Jacksons have no choice but to accept. Florence helps Laura when Laura and Henry's two small daughters are ill with whooping cough, and Laura offers Florence work helping care for her daughters. Hap, who serves as the preacher for the local black community, falls while helping to build a small church, breaking a leg and rendering him unable to work. Laura sneaks money from her husband's safe so Hap can be treated by a doctor.\n\nWhen the war ends, Ronsel and Jamie return home and realize that they've changed, but the local society hasn't. Jamie becomes an alcoholic and suffers from PTSD. Ronsel, accustomed to the relative lack of racism among Europeans, struggles with racism back home. They become aware of each others' difficulties and bond over their war experiences. Ronsel asks why Jamie treats him with respect; Jamie recounts that on a bomber flight, a black fighter pilot saved his life. Jamie's drunkeness gets worse and he wakes up from a nightmare  with the car partially submerged in a lake. Henry leaves on a trip and tells Jamie to leave the farm before he returns.\n\nRonsel receives a letter from the German woman with whom he'd been romantically involved during the war. He learns that they had a child together and she wants Ronsel to join them. He shares this with Jamie while riding together in the McAllans' truck. Their truck passes Pappy and Ronsel must hide. Pappy confronts Jamie about seeing him with Rondel. He yells at Jamie for his drunken behavior and sneers at Laura, claiming she has feelings for Jamie. Later, Ronsel realizes that he lost the letter and photo and runs out to look for it. Pappy finds the letter and photo in the truck. Laura confronts Jamie as he packs to leave, and they make love. \n\nAs Ronsel searches for his letter, he is ambushed by Pappy and members of the Ku Klux Klan and beaten. Pappy brings Jamie to a barn where the Klan is preparing to kill Ronsel for fathering a child with a white woman. Jamie points a gun at his father in an effort to save his friend, and is beaten by members of the Klan. As Jamie is restrained and in pain, he is told to choose Ronsel's punishment for his crime -- to lose his eyes, tongue or testicles -- or watch Ronsel be put to death. Through the pain, Jamie whispers \"tongue\" and Ronsel's tongue is cut out. Ronsel is left bound and wounded for his family to find. \n\nLater that night, Jamie wakes Pappy. Pappy had previously belittled Jamie's war awards because he hadn't had to look in the eyes of the people he killed. Jamie looks Pappy in the eye and smothers him with a pillow.\n\nThe film returns to the opening scene. The Jacksons appear to be leaving with their meager belongings in the wagon. Hap accedes to Henry's request to help with the coffin and says a prayer over the grave. In a rebuke to Pappy, Hap recites from the Book of Job, verses 14:2-12. As Henry begins to bury his father, Jamie walks away. He approaches the Jacksons' wagon and gives the German woman's envelope to Florence, asking her to give it to Ronsel if she should see him. \n\nMuch later, Jamie moves to the city. Ronsel makes his way back to Europe and reunites with the German woman and his son.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- Per end credits --->\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Laura McAllan (n\u00e9e Chappell)\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Henry McAllan\n* [[Mary J.

In 1923, he became the chairman of the board of the Postum Cereal Company, and they developed a larger variety of food products, including [[Clarence Birdseye|Birdseye Frozen Foods]]. The company became the [[General Foods]] Corporation in 1929. Post and Hutton divorced in 1935.

They had no children and were divorced in 1955. From 1937 to 1938, in a crucial period leading up to [[World War II]], Davies served as the American ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], ruled at that time by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During this time, Davies and Post acquired many valuable Russian works of art from Soviet authorities.\n\nIn 1951, their Long Island estate, which she had purchased in 1922 with Hutton, located in [[Brookville, New York]], was sold to [[Long Island University]] for $200,000.

Post served as the honorary house mother of the college's first local fraternity, Sigma Beta Epsilon, which, in 1969, became the New York Beta chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]. Since Post had borne only girls, she referred to the fraternity of sons-in-law as her \"boys\", while they called her \"Mother Marjorie\". Post was honored by [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity as a \"Golden Daughter of Minerva\".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nHer final marriage, in 1958, was to Herbert A.

There are four genders in this language:\n\n:u masculine\n:ka feminine\n:i diminutive\n:ki plural\n\nHumans and domestic animals have their natural gender:\n\n:ka kmie `mother'\n:u kpa  `father'\n:ka syiar `hen'\n:u syiar `rooster'\n\nRabel (1961) writes: \"the structure of a noun gives no indication of its gender, nor does its meaning, but Khasi natives are of the impression that nice, small creatures and things are feminine while big, ugly creatures and things are masculine....This impression is not born out by the facts.  There are countless examples of desirable and lovely creatures with masculine gender as well as of unpleasant or ugly creatures with feminine gender\"\n\nThough there are several counterexamples, Rabel says that there is some semantic regularity in the assignment of gender for the following semantic classes:\n\n{|\n|'''Feminine'''\n|'''Masculine'''\n|-\n|times, seasons\n\n|-\n|clothes\n|reptiles, insects, flora, trees\n|-\n|physical features of nature\n|heavenly bodies\n|-\n|manufactured articles\n|edible raw material\n|-\n|tools for polishing\n|tools for hammering, digging\n|-\n|trees of soft fibre\n|trees of hard fibre\n|}\n\nThe matrilineal aspect of the society can also be observed in the general gender assignment, where so, all central and primary resources associated with day-to-day activities are signified as Feminine; whereas Masculine signifies the secondary, the dependent or the insignificant.\n\n{|\n|'''Feminine'''\n|'''Masculine'''\n|-\n|Sun (Ka Sngi)\n|Moon (U Bnai)\n|-\n|Wood (Ka Dieng)\n|Tree (U Dieng)\n|-\n|Honey (Ka Ngap)\n|Bee (U Ngap)\n|-\n|House (Ka \u00cfing)\n|Column (U Rishot)\n|-\n|Cooked rice (Ka Ja)\n|Uncooked rice (U Khaw)\n|}\n\n====Classifiers====\n\nKhasi has a classifier system, apparently used only with numerals.  Between the numeral and noun, the classifier ''tylli'' is used for non-humans, and the classifier ''ngut'' is used for humans, e.g.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Don ||ar|| tylli|| ki|| sim|| ha|| ruh.\n|-\n| there:are||two||classifier||plural||bird||in||cage\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'There are two birds in the cage.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Don ||lai|| ngut|| ki|| Sordar||  ha|| shnong.\n|-\n| there:are||three||classifier||plural||chief||in||village\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'There are three chiefs in the village.'\n|}\n\n===Adjectives===\nThere is some controversy about whether Khasi has a class of adjectives.  Roberts cites examples like the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u  ||briew|| ba-bha\n|-\n| masc||man||rel-good\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'a good man'\n|}\nIn nearly all instances of attributive adjectives, the apparent adjective has the prefix /ba-/, which seems to be a relativiser.  There are, however, a few adjectives without the /ba-/ prefix:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u  ||'riew|| sn\u00edew\n|-\n| masc||man||bad\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'a bad man'\n|}\n\nWhen the adjective is the main predicate, it may appear without any verb 'be':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| U ||ksew|| u||  lamwir.\n|-\n| masc||dog||masc||restless\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'The dog is restless.'\n|}\n\nIn this environment, the adjective is preceded by an agreement marker, like a verb.  Thus it may be that Khasi does not have a separate part of speech for adjectives, but that they are a subtype of verb.\n\n===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===\n\nKhasi appears to have a well-developed group of prepositions, among them\n:bad    'with, and'\n:da    'with (instrumental)'\n:na    'from'\n:ha    'in, at'\n:jong    'of'\n\nThe following are examples of prepositional phrases:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ka|| kmie || jong|| phi\n|-\n| fem || mother || of ||you\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|'your mother'\n|}\n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u ||slap || u|| ther|| na||  ka|| bneng\n|-\n| masc || rain || masc||pour||from||fem||sky\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|'Rain poured from the sky.'\n|}\n\n===Verbs and verb phrases===\n\n====Agreement====\nVerbs agree with 3rd person subjects in gender, but there is no agreement for non-3rd persons (Roberts 1891):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n| '''1st person''' || nga thoh 'I write' || ngi thoh 'we write\u2019\n|-\n| '''2nd person''' || me thoh 'he (masc) writes' pha thoh 'she (fem) writes' || phi thoh 'you (pl). write'\n|-\n| '''3rd person''' || u thoh 'he writes' ka thoh 'she writes' || ki thoh 'they write\u2019\n|}\n\nThe masculine and feminine markers /u/ and /ka/ are used even when there is a noun phrase subject (Roberts 1891:132):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Ka  ||miaw|| ka|| pah.\n|-\n| fem || cat || fem || meow\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|'The cat meows.\u2019\n|}\n\n====Tense marking====\n\nTense is shown through a set of particles that appear after the agreement markers but before the verb. Past is a particle /la/ and future is /yn/ (contracted to 'n after a vowel):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Khasi !! English\n|-\n| U thoh. || He writes.\n|-\n| U la thoh. || He wrote.\n|-\n| Un thoh || He will write.\n|-\n|}\n\n====Negation====\n\nNegation is also shown through a particle, /ym/ (contracted to 'm after a vowel), which appears between the agreement and the tense particle.  There is a special past negation particle /shym/ in the past which replaces the ordinary past /la/ (Roberts 1891):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Khasi !! English\n|-\n| Um ju thoh. || He doesn't write.\n|-\n| Um shym thoh. || He didn't write.\n|-\n| Um nym thoh || He won't write.\n|-\n|Um dei ban thoh\n|He shouldn't write.\n|-\n|}\n\n====Copulas====\n\nThe copula is an ordinary verb in Khasi, as in the following sentence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| U ||Blei|| u|| long|| jing\u00efeid.\n|-\n| masc || God || masc || be||love\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"|'God is love\u2019\n|}\n\n====Causative verbs====\n\nKhasi has a morphological causative /pn-/ (Rabel 1961). (This is spelled ''pyn'' in Roberts (1891)):\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Base verb !!Gloss !!Causative verb !!Gloss\n|-\n|hiar ||come down ||pynhiar ||let down, export\n|-\n|tip || know ||pyntip ||make known\n|-\n|phuh ||blossom ||pynphuh ||beautify\n|-\n|\u00efaid ||walk ||pyn-\u00efaid ||drive, put agoing\n|-\n|jot ||torn ||pyn-jot ||destroy\n|-\n|poi || arrive ||pyn-poi ||deliver\n|}\n\n===Sentences===\n\n====Word order====\nWord order in simple sentences is subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|U ||ksew|| u||  bam|| doh.\n|-\n| masc || dog || masc || eat||flesh\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"|'The dog eats meat.\u2019\n|}\n\nHowever, VSO order is also found, especially after certain initial particles, like hangta 'then' (Rabel 1961).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|hangta|| la|| ong|| i|| khnai|| \u00efa|| ka|| Naam\n|-\n|then || past|| say||dimin||mouse|| accusative||fem||Naam\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'Then said the (little) mouse to Naam ... ' \n|}\n\n====Case marking====\nSometimes the object is preceded by a particle ya (spelled ia in Roberts 1891).  Roberts says \"ia, 'to', 'for', 'against' implies direct and immediate relation.  Hence its being the sign of the dative and of the [[accusative case]] as well\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|U ||la|| \u00e1i||  ia|| ka|| kitab|| ia|| nga.\n|-\n| masc || past || give || accusative||fem||book||accusative||me\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'He gave the book to me.'\n|}\n\nIt appears from Roberts (1891) that Khasi has [[differential object marking]], since only some objects are marked accusative.  Roberts notes that nouns that are definite usually have the accusative and those that are indefinite often do not.\n\nRabel (1961) says \"the use of \u00efa is optional in the case of one object.  In the case of two objects one of them must have \u00efa preceding.... If one of the objects is expressed by a pronoun, it must be preceded by \u00efa.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, Khasi marks for eight cases, with the [[nominative case]] remaining unmarked, for a total of nine cases\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Case ||Marker\n|-\n| [[Nominative case| Nominative]] || unmarked\n|-\n| [[Accusative case| Accusative]]/[[Dative case| Dative]] || \u00efa\n|-\n| [[Ablative case| Ablative]] || na\n|-\n| [[Locative case| Locative]] || ha\n|-\n| [[Allative case| Allative]] || sha\n|-\n| [[Genitive case| Genitive]] || jong\n|-\n| [[Instrumental case| Instrumental]] || da\n|-\n| [[Comitative case| Comitative]] || bad\n|-\n| [[Vocative case| Vocative]] || ko\n|}\n\nAll case markers can appear with or without the prenominal markers/articles 'u, ka, i and ki', and placed before the prenominal markers.\n\n====Passive====\n\nKhasi has a passive, but it involves removing the agent of the sentence without putting the patient in subject position.  (A type called the 'non-ascensional passive').  Compare the following active-passive pair (Roberts 1891) where the patient continues to have accusative case and remains in the object position:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ki ||dang|| th\u00e1w|| ia|| ka|| \u00edng||   da|| ki|| dieng..\n|-\n| plur || contin || build || accusative||fem||house||with||plur||wood\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'They are building the house with wood.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Dang|| th\u00e1w|| ia|| ka|| \u00edng.\n|-\n| contin || build || accusative||fem||house\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'The house is being built.'\n|}\n\nThis type of passive is used, even when the passive agent is present in a prepositional phrase:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|La || lah || pyniap|| ia|| ka|| masi|| da|| U M\u00edet.\n|-\n| past || perfective || kill || accusative||fem||cow||by||U Miet\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'The cow was killed by U Miet.'\n|}\n\n====Questions====\n\nYes-no questions seem to be distinguished from statements only by intonation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Phi|| kit||  khoh||  Til?\n|-\n|you||are carrying|| a basket||Til?\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'Will you take a basket, Til? Phin shim ka khoh, Til?\n\n|}\nWh-questions don't involve moving the wh-element:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|u|| leit|| shaei?\n|-\n|masc||go||where\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|Where is he going?'\n|}\n\n====Embedded clauses====\n\nSubordinate clauses follow the main verb that selects them (Roberts 1891:169):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Nga ||tip||  ba|| phi||  la|| leh|| ia|| kata.\n|-\n|I||know||that||you||past||do||accusative||that\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'I know that you have done that'\n|}\n\nRelative clauses follow the nouns that they modify and agree in gender:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ka|| samla kynthei|| ka-ba|| wan|| mynhynnin|| ka|| la|| i\u00e1p.\n|-\n|fem||girl||fem-relative||come||yesterday||fem||past||die\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'The girl who came yesterday has died.'\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nKhasi has a SVO syntax, similar to English, but unlike all Indian languages, with the notable exception of [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], which has SVO syntax.\n\n==Dialects of Khasi==\nKhasi has significant dialectal variation. Some dialects are Sohra Khasi, Mylliem Khasi, Mawlai Khasi, Nongkrem Khasi, Bhoi Khasi Nonglung, Maram and War (not the same as the related [[War language]]). Bhoi Khasi in Ri Bhoi District, Nongpoh block, and Nonglung in Ri Bhoi District, Umsning block are very different from Standard Khasi, with different word order. They are distinct enough to be sometimes considered separate languages. Sohra and War are lexically very similar.\n\nThe Sohra dialect is taken as Standard Khasi as it was the first dialect to be written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] scripts by the British. Standard Khasi is in turn significantly different from the Shillong dialects (eight at most) which form a [[dialect continuum]] across the capital region.\n\n==Script==\nIn the past, the Khasi language had no script of its own. Some of the Khasi Syiems of old used to keep official records and communicate with one another on paper primarily using the Bengali script. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] wrote the language with the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] between 1813 and 1838. A large number of Khasi books were written in the Bengali script, including the famous book ''Ka Niyom Jong Ki Khasi'' or ''The Religion of the Khasis'', which is an important work on the Khasi religion. The Welsh [[missionary]], [[Thomas Jones (missionary)|Thomas Jones]], in 1841 wrote the language in the [[Latin script]]. As a result, the Latin alphabet of the language has a few similarities with the [[Welsh alphabet]]. The first journal in Khasi was ''U Nongkit Khubor'' (The Messenger) published at [[Mawphlang]] in 1889 by [[William Williams (missionary)|William Williams]].\n\n==Khasi Alphabet==\n\nKhasi in Latin script has a different system, distinct from that of English. Khasi uses a 23-letter alphabet by removing the letters c, f, q, v, x and z from the basic Latin alphabet and adding the diacritic letters \u00ef and \u00f1, and the digraph ng, which is treated as a letter in its own right. Khasi in Bengali script uses all the letters of the [[Bengali alphabet]].\n{|class= \"wikitable\" style =\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Khasi Alphabet\n|-\n!'''Capital letters'''\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| A\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| B\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| K\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| D\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| E\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| G\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| Ng\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| H\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| I\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| \u00cf\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| J\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| L\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| M\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| N\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| \u00d1\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| O\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| P\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| R \n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| S\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| T\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| U\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| W\n| Y\n|-\n!'''Small letters'''\n|a\n|b\n|k\n|d\n|e\n|g\n|ng\n|h\n|i\n|\u00ef\n|j\n|l\n|m\n|n\n|\u00f1\n|o\n|p\n|r\n|s\n|t\n|u\n|w\n|y\n|-\n!'''English Pronunciation'''\n|''ah''\n|''bee''\n|''kay''\n|''dee''\n|''ay''\n|''eg''\n|''eng''\n|''esh''\n|''ee''\n|''yee''\n|''jay''\n|''ell''\n|''emm''\n|''enn''\n|''e\u00f1''\n|''oh''\n|''pea''\n|''aar''\n|''ess''\n|''tee''\n|''oo''\n|''double yu''\n|''why''\n|-\n!'''Bengali'''\n|''\u0986''\n|''\u09ac''\n|''\u0995''\n|''\u09a6''\n|''\u098f''\n|''\u0997''\n|''\u0985\u0982''\n|''\u09b9''\n|''\u0987''\n|''\u09af\u09bc\u09bf''\n|''\u099c''\n|''\u09b2''\n|''\u09ae''\n|''\u09a8''\n|''\u099e''\n|''\u0993''\n|''\u09aa''\n|''\u09b0''\n|''\u09b8''\n|''\u09a4''\n|''\u0989''\n|''\u098a''\n|''\u0988''\n|}\n\n'''Note'''\n* The peculiar placement of ''k'' is due to it replacing ''c''.

It is not used independently in any word of native origin.\n* ''h'' represents both the [[fricative]] sound as well as the [[glottal stop]] word-finally.\n* ''y'' is not pronounced as in ''year'', but acts as a [[schwa]], and as a [[glottal stop]] between vowels. The sound in '' year'' is written with ''\u00ef''.\n\n==Sample text in Khasi==\n\n===Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\n\n'''Khasi Alphabet'''\n\n\u00cfa ki bynriew baroh la kha laitluid bad ki \u00efaryngkat ha ka burom bad ki hok.

Khasi is part of the Austroasiatic language family, and is related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Palaung language|Palaung]] , [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] languages of Southeast Asia, and the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]] branches of that family, which are spoken in east\u2013central India and in the [[Nicobar Islands]], respectively.\n\nAlthough most of the 1.6&nbsp;million Khasi speakers are found in Meghalaya, the language is also spoken by a number of people in the [[Dima Hasao|hill districts]] of Assam bordering with Meghalaya and by a sizeable population of people living in Bangladesh, close to the [[Bangladesh-India border|Indian border]].

It is also spoken by a number of people in the hill districts of Assam and by a small population of people living in Bangladesh. Khasi has been an associate official language in Meghalaya since 2005.\n\nKhasi is written using the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] scripts. Both scripts are taught as part of the compulsory Khasi language subject in elementary up to high school in Meghalaya and Bangladesh respectively.\n\nThe main dialects of Khasi spoken are Sohra and Shillong dialect. Shillong dialects form a [[dialect continuum]] across the capital region. Sohra dialect, due to strong colonial patronisation, came to be regarded as ''Standard Khasi.''\n\n==Phonology==\n\nThis section discusses mainly the [[phonology]] of Standard Khasi as spoken in and around the capital city, Shillong.\n\nKhasi, mainly spoken in Meghalaya, is surrounded by unrelated languages: [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to the north and east, [[Bengali language|Bengali]] to the south (both [[Indo-Aryan languages]]), [[Garo language|Garo]] (a [[Tibeto-Burman language]]) to the west, and a plethora of other Tibeto-Burman languages including [[Meithei language|Manipuri]], [[Mizo language|Mizo]] and [[Bodo language|Bodo]].\n\nAlthough over the course of time, language change has occurred, Khasi retains some distinctive features:\n* Unlike the surrounding Tibeto-Burman languages, Khasi is not a tonal language.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Consonant phonemes\n|-\n! colspan= 4 |\n! colspan=2 |[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br>alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=2 |[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! colspan= 4| [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|m}}\n| colspan= 6| {{IPA link|n}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|\u0272}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|\u014b}}\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n! rowspan=2 colspan= 2 |[[Plosive consonant|Stop]]\n!colspan= 2 | [[Unaspirated]]\n| style= \"border-right: 0;\"| {{IPA link|p}}\n| style= \"border-left: 0;\"| {{IPA link|b}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|t\u032a}}\n| colspan= 4| {{IPA link|d}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|c}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|k}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|\u0294}}\n|-\n!colspan= 2 | [[Aspirated consonant|Aspirated]]\n| style= \"border-right: 0;\"| {{IPA link|p\u02b0}}\n| style= \"border-left: 0;\"| {{IPA link|b\u02b1}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|t\u032a\u02b0}}\n| colspan= 4| {{IPA link|d\u02b1}}\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|k\u02b0}}\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n! rowspan=2 colspan= 2 |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!colspan= 2 | [[Unaspirated]]\n| style= \"border-right: 0;\"|\n| style= \"border-left: 0;\"|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 4| {{IPA link|d\u0292}}\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n!colspan= 2 | [[Aspirated consonant|Aspirated]]\n| style= \"border-right: 0;\"|\n| style= \"border-left: 0;\"|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 4| {{IPA link|d\u0292\u02b1}}\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n! colspan= 4| [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|s}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|\u0283}}\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|h}}\n|-\n! colspan= 4| [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|j}}\n| colspan= 2| {{IPA link|w}}\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n! colspan= 4| [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 6| {{IPAlink|r}}\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n| colspan= 2|\n|-\n! colspan= 4| [[Lateral consonant|Lat.

There are four genders in this language:\n\n:u masculine\n:ka feminine\n:i diminutive\n:ki plural\n\nHumans and domestic animals have their natural gender:\n\n:ka kmie `mother'\n:u kpa  `father'\n:ka syiar `hen'\n:u syiar `rooster'\n\nRabel (1961) writes: \"the structure of a noun gives no indication of its gender, nor does its meaning, but Khasi natives are of the impression that nice, small creatures and things are feminine while big, ugly creatures and things are masculine....This impression is not born out by the facts.  There are countless examples of desirable and lovely creatures with masculine gender as well as of unpleasant or ugly creatures with feminine gender\"\n\nThough there are several counterexamples, Rabel says that there is some semantic regularity in the assignment of gender for the following semantic classes:\n\n{|\n|'''Feminine'''\n|'''Masculine'''\n|-\n|times, seasons\n\n|-\n|clothes\n|reptiles, insects, flora, trees\n|-\n|physical features of nature\n|heavenly bodies\n|-\n|manufactured articles\n|edible raw material\n|-\n|tools for polishing\n|tools for hammering, digging\n|-\n|trees of soft fibre\n|trees of hard fibre\n|}\n\nThe matrilineal aspect of the society can also be observed in the general gender assignment, where so, all central and primary resources associated with day-to-day activities are signified as Feminine; whereas Masculine signifies the secondary, the dependent or the insignificant.\n\n{|\n|'''Feminine'''\n|'''Masculine'''\n|-\n|Sun (Ka Sngi)\n|Moon (U Bnai)\n|-\n|Wood (Ka Dieng)\n|Tree (U Dieng)\n|-\n|Honey (Ka Ngap)\n|Bee (U Ngap)\n|-\n|House (Ka \u00cfing)\n|Column (U Rishot)\n|-\n|Cooked rice (Ka Ja)\n|Uncooked rice (U Khaw)\n|}\n\n====Classifiers====\n\nKhasi has a classifier system, apparently used only with numerals.  Between the numeral and noun, the classifier ''tylli'' is used for non-humans, and the classifier ''ngut'' is used for humans, e.g.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Don ||ar|| tylli|| ki|| sim|| ha|| ruh.\n|-\n| there:are||two||classifier||plural||bird||in||cage\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'There are two birds in the cage.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Don ||lai|| ngut|| ki|| Sordar||  ha|| shnong.\n|-\n| there:are||three||classifier||plural||chief||in||village\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'There are three chiefs in the village.'\n|}\n\n===Adjectives===\nThere is some controversy about whether Khasi has a class of adjectives.  Roberts cites examples like the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u  ||briew|| ba-bha\n|-\n| masc||man||rel-good\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'a good man'\n|}\nIn nearly all instances of attributive adjectives, the apparent adjective has the prefix /ba-/, which seems to be a relativiser.  There are, however, a few adjectives without the /ba-/ prefix:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u  ||'riew|| sn\u00edew\n|-\n| masc||man||bad\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'a bad man'\n|}\n\nWhen the adjective is the main predicate, it may appear without any verb 'be':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| U ||ksew|| u||  lamwir.\n|-\n| masc||dog||masc||mad\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" |'The dog is mad.'\n|}\n\nIn this environment, the adjective is preceded by an agreement marker, like a verb.  Thus it may be that Khasi does not have a separate part of speech for adjectives, but that they are a subtype of verb.\n\n===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===\n\nKhasi appears to have a well-developed group of prepositions, among them\n:bad    'with, and'\n:da    'with (instrumental)'\n:na    'from'\n:ha    'in, at'\n:jong    'of'\n\nThe following are examples of prepositional phrases:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ka|| kmie || jong|| phi\n|-\n| fem || mother || of ||you\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|'your mother'\n|}\n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| u ||slap || u|| ther|| na||  ka|| bneng\n|-\n| masc || rain || masc||pour||from||fem||sky\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|'Rain poured from the sky.'\n|}\n\n===Verbs and verb phrases===\n\n====Agreement====\nVerbs agree with 3rd person subjects in gender, but there is no agreement for non-3rd persons (Roberts 1891):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n| '''1st person''' || nga thoh 'I write' || ngi thoh 'we write\u2019\n|-\n| '''2nd person''' || me thoh 'you (fam.) write' phi thoh 'you (form.) write' || phi thoh 'you (pl). write' \n|-\n| '''3rd person''' || u thoh 'he writes' ka thoh 'she writes' || ki thoh 'they write\u2019\n|}\n\nThe masculine and feminine markers /u/ and /ka/ are used even when there is a noun phrase subject (Roberts 1891:132):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Ka  ||miaw|| ka|| pah.\n|-\n| fem || cat || fem || meow\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|'The cat meows.\u2019\n|}\n\n====Tense marking====\n\nTense is shown through a set of particles that appear after the agreement markers but before the verb. Past is a particle /la/ and future is /yn/ (contracted to 'n after a vowel):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Khasi !! English\n|-\n| U thoh. || He writes.\n|-\n| U la thoh. || He wrote.\n|-\n| Un thoh || He will write.\n|-\n|}\n\n====Negation====\n\nNegation is also shown through a particle, /ym/ (contracted to 'm after a vowel), which appears between the agreement and the tense particle.  There is a special past negation particle /shym/ in the past which replaces the ordinary past /la/ (Roberts 1891):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Khasi !! English\n|-\n| Um thoh. || He doesn't write.\n|-\n| Um shym thoh. || He didn't write.\n|-\n| Um nym thoh || He won't write.\n|-\n|}\n\n====Copulas====\n\nThe copula is an ordinary verb in Khasi, as in the following sentence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| U ||Blei|| u|| long|| jing\u00efeid.\n|-\n| masc || God || masc || be||love\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"|'God is love\u2019\n|}\n\n====Causative verbs====\n\nKhasi has a morphological causative /pn-/ (Rabel 1961). (This is spelled ''pyn'' in Roberts (1891)):\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Base verb !!Gloss !!Causative verb !!Gloss\n|-\n|hiar ||come down ||pynhiar ||let down, export\n|-\n|tip || know ||pyntip ||make known\n|-\n|phuh ||blossom ||pynphuh ||beautify\n|-\n|\u00efaid ||walk ||pyn-\u00efaid ||drive, put agoing\n|-\n|jot ||perish ||pyn-jot ||destroy\n|-\n|poi || arrive ||pyn-poi ||send\n|}\n\n===Sentences===\n\n====Word order====\nWord order in simple sentences is subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|U ||ksew|| u||  bam|| doh.\n|-\n| masc || dog || masc || eat||flesh\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\"|'The dog eats meat.\u2019\n|}\n\nHowever, VSO order is also found, especially after certain initial particles, like hangta 'then' (Rabel 1961).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|hangta|| la|| ong|| i|| khnai|| \u00efa|| ka|| Naam\n|-\n|then || past|| say||dimin||mouse|| accusative||fem||Naam\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'Then said the (little) mouse to Naam ... ' \n|}\n\n====Case marking====\nSometimes the object is preceded by a particle ya (spelled ia in Roberts 1891).  Roberts says \"ia, 'to', 'for', 'against' implies direct and immediate relation.  Hence its being the sign of the dative and of the [[accusative case]] as well\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|U ||la|| \u00e1i||  ia|| ka|| kitab|| ia|| nga.\n|-\n| masc || past || give || accusative||fem||book||accusative||me\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'He gave the book to me.'\n|}\n\nIt appears from Roberts (1891) that Khasi has [[differential object marking]], since only some objects are marked accusative.  Roberts notes that nouns that are definite usually have the accusative and those that are indefinite often do not.\n\nRabel (1961) says \"the use of \u00efa is optional in the case of one object.  In the case of two objects one of them must have \u00efa preceding.... If one of the objects is expressed by a pronoun, it must be preceded by \u00efa.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, Khasi marks for eight cases, with the [[nominative case]] remaining unmarked, for a total of nine cases\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Case ||Marker\n|-\n| [[Nominative case| Nominative]] || unmarked\n|-\n| [[Accusative case| Accusative]]/[[Dative case| Dative]] || \u00efa\n|-\n| [[Ablative case| Ablative]] || na\n|-\n| [[Locative case| Locative]] || ha\n|-\n| [[Allative case| Allative]] || sha\n|-\n| [[Genitive case| Genitive]] || jong\n|-\n| [[Instrumental case| Instrumental]] || da\n|-\n| [[Comitative case| Comitative]] || bad\n|-\n| [[Vocative case| Vocative]] || ko\n|}\n\nAll case markers can appear with or without the prenominal markers/articles 'u, ka, i and ki', and placed before the prenominal markers.\n\n====Passive====\n\nKhasi has a passive, but it involves removing the agent of the sentence without putting the patient in subject position.  (A type called the 'non-ascensional passive').  Compare the following active-passive pair (Roberts 1891) where the patient continues to have accusative case and remains in the object position:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ki ||dang|| th\u00e1w|| ia|| ka|| \u00edng||   da|| ki|| dieng..\n|-\n| plur || contin || build || accusative||fem||house||from||plur||wood\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'They are building the house of wood.'\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Dang|| th\u00e1w|| ia|| ka|| \u00edng.\n|-\n| contin || build || accusative||fem||house\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'The house is being built.'\n|}\n\nThis type of passive is used, even when the passive agent is present in a prepositional phrase:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|La || lah || pyniap|| ia|| ka|| masi|| da|| U M\u00edet.\n|-\n| past || perfective || kill || accusative||fem||cow||by||U Miet\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"|'The cow was killed by U Miet.'\n|}\n\n====Questions====\n\nYes-no questions seem to be distinguished from statements only by intonation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Phi|| kit||  khoh||  Til?\n|-\n|you||are carrying|| a basket||Til?\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'Will you take a basket, Til? Phin shim ka khoh, Til?\n\n|}\nWh-questions don't involve moving the wh-element:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|u|| leit|| shaei?\n|-\n|masc||go||where\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|Where is he going?'\n|}\n\n====Embedded clauses====\n\nSubordinate clauses follow the main verb that selects them (Roberts 1891:169):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Nga ||tip||  ba|| phi||  la|| leh|| ia|| kata.\n|-\n|I||know||that||you||past||do||accusative||that\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'I know that you have done that'\n|}\n\nRelative clauses follow the nouns that they modify and agree in gender:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Ka|| samla kynthei|| ka-ba|| wan|| mynhynnin|| ka|| la|| i\u00e1p.\n|-\n|fem||girl||fem-relative||come||yesterday||fem||past||die\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"|'The girl who came yesterday has died.'\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nKhasi has a SVO syntax, similar to English, but unlike all Indian languages, with the notable exception of [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], which has SVO syntax.\n\n==Dialects of Khasi==\nKhasi has significant dialectal variation. Some dialects are Sohra Khasi, Mylliem Khasi, Mawlai Khasi, Nongkrem Khasi, Bhoi Khasi Nonglung, Maram and War (not the same as the related [[War language]]). Bhoi Khasi in Ri Bhoi District, Nongpoh block, and Nonglung in Ri Bhoi District, Umsning block are very different from Standard Khasi, with different word order. They are distinct enough to be sometimes considered separate languages. Sohra and War are lexically very similar.\n\nThe Sohra dialect is taken as Standard Khasi as it was the first dialect to be written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] scripts by the British. Standard Khasi is in turn significantly different from the Shillong dialects (eight at most) which form a [[dialect continuum]] across the capital region.\n\n==Script==\nIn the past, the Khasi language had no script of its own. Some of the Khasi Syiems of old used to keep official records and communicate with one another on paper primarily using the Bengali script. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] wrote the language with the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] between 1813 and 1838. A large number of Khasi books were written in the Bengali script, including the famous book ''Ka Niyom Jong Ki Khasi'' or ''The Religion of the Khasis'', which is an important work on the Khasi religion. The Welsh [[missionary]], [[Thomas Jones (missionary)|Thomas Jones]], in 1841 wrote the language in the [[Latin script]]. As a result, the Latin alphabet of the language has a few similarities with the [[Welsh alphabet]]. The first journal in Khasi was ''U Nongkit Khubor'' (The Messenger) published at [[Mawphlang]] in 1889 by [[William Williams (missionary)|William Williams]].\n\n==Khasi Alphabet==\n\nKhasi in Latin script has a different system, distinct from that of English. Khasi uses a 23-letter alphabet by removing the letters c, f, q, v, x and z from the basic Latin alphabet and adding the diacritic letters \u00ef and \u00f1, and the digraph ng, which is treated as a letter in its own right. Khasi in Bengali script uses all the letters of the [[Bengali alphabet]].\n{|class= \"wikitable\" style =\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Khasi Alphabet\n|-\n!'''Capital letters'''\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| A\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| B\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| K\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| D\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| E\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| G\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| Ng\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| H\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| I\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| \u00cf\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| J\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| L\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| M\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| N\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| \u00d1\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| O\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| P\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| R \n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| S\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| T\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| U\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\u201c| W\n| Y\n|-\n!'''Small letters'''\n|a\n|b\n|k\n|d\n|e\n|g\n|ng\n|h\n|i\n|\u00ef\n|j\n|l\n|m\n|n\n|\u00f1\n|o\n|p\n|r\n|s\n|t\n|u\n|w\n|y\n|-\n!'''English Pronunciation'''\n|''ah''\n|''bee''\n|''kay''\n|''dee''\n|''ay''\n|''eg''\n|''eng''\n|''esh''\n|''ee''\n|''yee''\n|''jay''\n|''ell''\n|''emm''\n|''enn''\n|''e\u00f1''\n|''oh''\n|''pea''\n|''aar''\n|''ess''\n|''tee''\n|''oo''\n|''double yu''\n|''why''\n|-\n!'''Bengali'''\n|''\u0986''\n|''\u09ac''\n|''\u0995''\n|''\u09a6''\n|''\u098f''\n|''\u0997''\n|''\u0985\u0982''\n|''\u09b9''\n|''\u0987''\n|''\u09af\u09bc\u09bf''\n|''\u099c''\n|''\u09b2''\n|''\u09ae''\n|''\u09a8''\n|''\u099e''\n|''\u0993''\n|''\u09aa''\n|''\u09b0''\n|''\u09b8''\n|''\u09a4''\n|''\u0989''\n|''\u098a''\n|''\u0988''\n|}\n\n'''Note'''\n* The peculiar placement of ''k'' is due to it replacing ''c''.

It is not used independently in any word of native origin.\n* ''h'' represents both the [[fricative]] sound as well as the [[glottal stop]] word-finally.\n* ''y'' is not pronounced as in ''year'', but acts as a [[schwa]], and as a [[glottal stop]] between vowels. The sound in '' year'' is written with ''\u00ef''.\n\n==Sample text in Khasi==\n\n===Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\n\n'''Khasi Alphabet'''\n\n\u00cfa ki bynriew baroh la kha laitluid bad ki \u00efaryngkat ha ka burom bad ki hok.

Created by [[Peter David]] and [[Bill Mumy]], it premiered on March 2, 1996 and ended on January 27, 1997 with reruns until 1998. It aired for a time on Nickelodeon's Saturday night block of shows known as [[SNICK]], and on [[Nickelodeon UK]], with reruns on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family]] and [[TVOntario]] in Canada. An episode aired on [[TeenNick]] in the US as part of its ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' block on the night of October 14, 2011 for the block's U Pick with Stick line-up, and again on December 27, 2011 for Party Like It's the '90s.  Space Cases returned once again on the night of January 1, 2016 on [[TeenNick]] during the new [[The Splat]] programming block but has not aired since; the first four episodes of Season One were aired. The show's premise revolves around a group of misfit students and two adults who are stranded far from home aboard an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] ship. Their attempts at journeying back see many dangerous adventures and controversies, with some occasionally more mature themes.\n\nThe series was shot in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Because of budget constraints, props from ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]'' and other Nickelodeon programs were used in the series. In other episodes, more mundane props were used, as in the episode \"Homeward Bound,\" the character Suzee is sitting in a chair with [[compact discs]] pasted to either side. During the first season, electronic games such as ''[[Lights Out (game)|Lights Out]]'', were used as control panels on walls.\n\nSeason One's original theme song was orchestra-based, with an announcer voiceover giving a preamble. A vocal song telling the story of the Space Cases was used as the closing. For Season Two, this song was moved to the front and re-recorded to accommodate the removal of Catalina, the addition of Suzee, and some re-arranging to how the characters were presented. At some point after the series ended, Nickelodeon had the song re-recorded once more, using the same character arrangement as Season Two, but removing Suzee and adding Catalina back in, and created a new opening for the Season One episodes with this song.\n\nThe series features a multitude of celebrity guest stars throughout its run, including [[George Takei]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Katey Sagal]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Danny Tamberelli]] and [[Robin Leach]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{too long|section|date=August 2018}}\n\n*Theresa James \"T.J.\" Davenport ([[Cary Lawrence]]) is the children's [[vice principal]], but serves as their teacher aboard the ''Christa''. Davenport takes herself and the rest of the [[universe]] a little too seriously. She has a habit of [[fainting]] at the first sign of danger, but on several occasions has stood strong in the face of terrible danger, even though she ends up bluffing some of the time. In one episode, she becomes curious of Thelma's activities, and accidentally downloads herself, literally, into the ship's computers; her mood swings caused problems with the navigation until she was rescued.\n*Commander Seth Goddard (Paul Boretski) is a former Stardog, and fought in the Spung War. Busted in rank from Captain and forced to teach the \"Space Cases,\" Goddard is tough enough to whip the kids into shape, though his rigidity sometimes entices the kids to provoke him and Miss Davenport with practical jokes. He has a long and bitter rivalry with a space pirate named Reaver. It is revealed in the second-season episode \"Long Distance Calls\" that Goddard was busted in rank for \"almost starting a war\" with Reaver. Goddard's [[backstory]] is one of the least explained in the series, and Reaver's appearance in the episode (whose entrance into the plot is explained by the creation of a communications device that the Christa's crew has possession of and Reaver wants to steal) raises more questions than answers. For example, Reaver can hold his own in a fight against Radu, who is Andromedan and allegedly has the strength of ten Earth men. Reaver even, for a time, 'psychically' combats Suzee who, up to this point in the series, never had problems pitching her consciousness into another entity to control them.\n*Harlan Band ([[Walter Emanuel Jones]]) is a [[human]] from [[Earth]], and is attending the Academy to become a Stardog like his biological father, who was killed by an Andromedan during the Andromedan War. Because of this, he is often antagonistic and prejudiced against Radu, at least during Season One. Harlan is headstrong and the self-appointed leader of the students, acting as pilot on the bridge. However, he is extremely overconfident, which sometimes leads to his endangering the crew. Harlan displays advanced [[martial arts]] and gymnastics skills. Jones is also credited as stunt coordinator in an episode of ''Space Cases''.\n*Catalina ([[Jewel Staite]]) is a rainbow-haired female ship's engineer from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a [[moon]] of [[Saturn]]. Saturnians possess evolved vocal patterns, giving them and Catalina the ability to release destructive sonic screams. Though hers have disabled missiles, floored large attackers and assaulted the ship and all its contents, Catalina considers her powers to be \"nothing\" compared to the really skilled Saturnians who are known to shatter buildings with a single sonic blast. Catalina is often heard using the term \"grozit\" which appears to be a Saturnian non-vulgar [[Expletive attributive|expletive]], similar in usage to the word \"Heavens,\" in context such as \"Heavens, no/grozit, no.\" Series co-creator [[Peter David]] has used the curse \"grozit\" in his ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' novels and ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' comics.  Initially, Catalina carries on conversations with Suzee, a person whom she explains is an invisible friend that no one else can see, but her crewmates initially believe Suzee to be an imaginary friend, despite Catalina's insistence to the contrary. In the Season 1 finale, \"On the Road to Find Out\", Suzee is explicitly revealed to be a real person, played by Rebecca Herbst. It is explained that Suzee existed in another [[dimension]], on a planet called Yensid. In Season One, Catalina explains that their [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]]s are attuned to the same sonic frequency, allowing them to speak and even see each other as though they are in the same room (Catalina even turns to face Suzee as she talks to her). Catalina even tells the others that she can see Suzee, but no one else can. In Season Two, when Suzee and Catalina trade places, Catalina lives at Suzee's home and is not present on the ship in the same manner that Suzee seemed to be during Season One. During the second season, Suzee explains that something blocks off her ability to communicate with Catalina interdimensionally, which may have something to do with the reason why Suzee cannot see Catalina the same way Catalina saw Suzee in Season One. Staite would again play a young engineer on a spaceship years later as [[Kaylee Frye]] in the cult<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8211 |title=The World's Best Space Sci-Fi Ever: Your verdict |date=October 26, 2005 |publisher=New ScientistSpace.com |accessdate=August 6, 2006}}</ref>  television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)#Cult status|Firefly]]''.\n*Radu ([[Kristian Ayre]]) is a being from a planet called Andromeda (most people assume this to mean that he is from the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]). He has no real family, since Andromedans are hatched from eggs. Radu has super-sensitive [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[superhuman strength]], just as all Andromedans do, which was the reason behind the Spungs enslaving them and starting the Andromedan War. Radu suffers from an [[inferiority complex]]; as such, he tries his very hardest to get people to like him. The Andromedan culture is based on uniformity of mind and purpose, making Radu's desire to have a family and be his own person an anomaly of character. Radu has an appreciable sense of direction, which makes him the best candidate for the ship's navigator, forcing him to work in conjunction with the pilot, rival Harlan Band. Andromedans not only possess an internal temperature, but an internal barometric pressure as well. For this reason, when ill, snow may exude from an Andromedan's ears. Radu has a significantly greater molecular density than most humanoids, which accounts for his superior strength, and long hair, which is nearly impossible to cut. In the episode \"Desperately Seeking Suzee,\" when the ''Christa'' is knocked around, and the entire crew is thrust, Radu who stands comfortably still with his arms crossed. He is also more patient, logical and realistic than the rest of the crew, especially Harlan.\n*Bova (Rahi Azizi) is from [[Uranus]]. Members of his race have a small, pronged antenna growing from their forehead which can generate powerful blasts of [[electricity]]. Bova has an incredible [[metabolism]] that supplements his advanced energy production, which is the reason for his incredible appetite. He will eat nearly anything, and is always hungry. Being from Uranus, and thereby \"the butt of every joke,\" he is consistently [[pessimistic]] in every situation, a Uranian cultural trait. Bova is responsible for operating and monitoring the ''Christa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shields. The nature of Bova's name is never explained, but in the Season Two episode \"Long Distance Calls,\" when Bova's father, Benn, calls to speak to his son. This is a reference to science fiction writer [[Ben Bova]].\n*Rosie Ianni (Paige Christina) is from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and has the ability to produce vast amounts of [[heat]] at will. At the beginning of the series, she wears a helmet to help her control this ability, but it falls into disuse in subsequent episodes, revealing her naturally bald head, a trait of Mercurians. Because Mercury is so close to the [[Sun]], all Mercurians have a tendency to \"look on the bright side\" of things, and as a result, Rosie is the mothering influence within the crew, always trying to make sure that her fellow cadets are happy and getting along. She serves as a doctor/scientist as well as acting as the communications officer on the bridge. She has a tendency to adopt seemingly cute things that turn out to be troublesome for the crew. At one point in the series, Rosie temporarily took on the power to generate [[telekinetic]] energy blasts.\n*Thelma (Techno Human EmuLating MAchine) ([[Anik Matern]]), the mysterious ship's only native inhabitant, is an [[android (robot)|android]] who often malfunctions, owing in no small part to the fact that her [[memory]] chip, a small [[Gemstone|gem]] residing in her forehead, is cracked. (It is unclear whether the crystal was cracked when Harlan stepped on it, or if the damage was preexisting.) She has a habit of taking things too [[literal translation|literally]], and often does not realize moderately obvious things. In season 2, her appearance changes to reflect the altered appearance of the Christa following the emergency crash on a planet. Her color changes from copper to silver and her gem changes from amber to sapphire.\n*Suzee ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) is Catalina's best friend, and is believed to be imaginary by the crew throughout Season One. Following Catalina's apparent death at the end of Season One, Suzee joins the crew in her stead. Suzee's hair is similar to Catalina's, but is longer and actually shows up as colored streaks interspersed through her predominantly brunette hair. She is very intelligent (she is said to be \"smarter than a million books\" in the revised opening title sequence that includes her character) and has two sets of [[gills]] just beneath both sides of her [[clavicle]] that allow her to breathe in any [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], though not in the [[vacuum]] of space. A bit overconfident herself, and sometimes at odds with Miss Davenport for being treated like a child despite not officially being one of her students, Suzee is also a [[telepath]] who can read others' minds and project her consciousness into other people's minds in order to possess their bodies. This ability even extends to sentient computers, such as Pezu in the series finale \"A Friend in Need\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=A Friend in Need|series=Space Cases|network=Nickelodeon|season=2|number=13|airdate=January 27, 1997}}</ref> Suzee often acts as a rival to Harlan.  Rosie once accidentally blurts out that Suzee is attracted to Radu.\n*Elmira (Katie Emme McIninch) is a frequent ally of the ''Christa'' crew. She is a Spung [[fortune teller|oracle]] and as such, the crew did not trust her at first (especially Radu). Due to Spung society having a [[sexism|low opinion of their women]], Elmira ran away from home years ago. Despite her upbringing, she is quite gentle and pleasant, if rather secretive. Although Radu at first despises her for her origins, the two grow close and kiss twice. It is revealed in the Season One finale that she is Warlord Shank's daughter. She gives the first foreshadowing of Catalina's later \"death\" when she predicts that someone new will come and Catalina will disappear.\n*Warlord Shank ([[George Takei]]), is a Spung commander who is a deadly space pirate and adversary for the crew of the ''Christa'', having elite Spung officers under his command.

Nearby, an odd [[bird]]-like alien ship appears, and Harlan Band decides to sneak onto it; the other students, all of whom are younger and much less troublesome, follow Harlan onto the ship. During their exploration of the ship's interior, the organic ship bonds to each student when each touches a bulkhead.\n\nTJ Davenport, their teacher and principal, and Commander Seth Goddard go after them and, in a series of unfortunate events, become separated throughout the vessel. One of the students accidentally charges the engines, hurtling the ship off into a spatial rift. By the time everyone figures out that only the children who bonded to the ship can actually control it, the ship has stopped several [[light year]]s away from the Academy. They set off on a return trip which would take them at least seven years, four months, and twenty-two days at maximum speeds.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pilot===\n{{Episode table\n |background      = #bce07c\n |title           =\n |airdate         = 29\n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Breath of a Salesman\n |OriginalAirDate=Unaired\n |ShortSummary=An alien salesman, Yee Haw Jones, boards the ship.\n| LineColor = bce07c\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1996)===\n{{Episode table\n |background      = #0b1d27\n |overall         = 8\n |title           =\n |director        =\n |writer          =\n |airdate         = \n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=We Gotta Get Out of This Place\n | DirectedBy = John Bell\n | WrittenBy = Peter David, Bill Mumy\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1996|3|02}}\n |ShortSummary=After learning their field test is suspended because they aren't ready, the Space Cases try to prove themselves by making contact with the Christa, an alien ship outside Star Academy.

Created by [[Peter David]] and [[Bill Mumy]], it premiered on March 2, 1996 and ended on January 27, 1997 with reruns until 1998. It aired for a time on Nickelodeon's Saturday night block of shows known as [[SNICK]], and on [[Nickelodeon UK]], with reruns on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family]] and [[TVOntario]] in Canada. An episode aired on [[TeenNick]] in the US as part of its ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' block on the night of October 14, 2011 for the block's U Pick with Stick line-up, and again on December 27, 2011 for Party Like It's the '90s.  Space Cases returned once again on the night of January 1, 2016 on [[TeenNick]] during the new [[The Splat]] programming block but has not aired since; the first four episodes of Season One were aired. The show's premise revolves around a group of misfit students and two adults who are stranded far from home aboard an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] ship. Their attempts at journeying back see many dangerous adventures and controversies, with some occasionally more mature themes.\n\nThe series was shot in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Because of budget constraints, props from ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]'' and other Nickelodeon programs were used in the series. In other episodes, more mundane props were used, as in the episode \"Homeward Bound,\" the character Suzee is sitting in a chair with [[compact discs]] pasted to either side. During the first season, electronic games such as ''[[Lights Out (game)|Lights Out]]'', were used as control panels on walls.\n\nSeason One's original theme song was orchestra-based, with an announcer voiceover giving a preamble. A vocal song telling the story of the Space Cases was used as the closing. For Season Two, this song was moved to the front and re-recorded to accommodate the removal of Catalina, the addition of Suzee, and some re-arranging to how the characters were presented. At some point after the series ended, Nickelodeon had the song re-recorded once more, using the same character arrangement as Season Two, but removing Suzee and adding Catalina back in, and created a new opening for the Season One episodes with this song.\n\nThe series features a multitude of celebrity guest stars throughout its run, including [[George Takei]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Katey Sagal]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Danny Tamberelli]] and [[Robin Leach]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{too long|section|date=August 2018}}\n\n*Theresa James \"T.J.\" Davenport ([[Cary Lawrence]]) is the children's [[vice principal]], but serves as their teacher aboard the ''Christa''. Davenport takes herself and the rest of the [[universe]] a little too seriously. She has a habit of [[fainting]] at the first sign of danger, but on several occasions has stood strong in the face of terrible danger, even though she ends up bluffing some of the time. In one episode, she becomes curious of Thelma's activities, and accidentally downloads herself, literally, into the ship's computers; her mood swings caused problems with the navigation until she was rescued.\n*Commander Seth Goddard (Paul Boretski) is a former Stardog, and fought in the Spung War. Busted in rank from Captain and forced to teach the \"Space Cases,\" Goddard is tough enough to whip the kids into shape, though his rigidity sometimes entices the kids to provoke him and Miss Davenport with practical jokes. He has a long and bitter rivalry with a space pirate named Reaver. It is revealed in the second-season episode \"Long Distance Calls\" that Goddard was busted in rank for \"almost starting a war\" with Reaver. Goddard's [[backstory]] is one of the least explained in the series, and Reaver's appearance in the episode (whose entrance into the plot is explained by the creation of a communications device that the Christa's crew has possession of and Reaver wants to steal) raises more questions than answers. For example, Reaver can hold his own in a fight against Radu, who is Andromedan and allegedly has the strength of ten Earth men. Reaver even, for a time, 'psychically' combats Suzee who, up to this point in the series, never had problems pitching her consciousness into another entity to control them.\n*Harlan Band ([[Walter Emanuel Jones]]) is a [[human]] from [[Earth]], and is attending the Academy to become a Stardog like his biological father, who was killed by an Andromedan during the Andromedan War. Because of this, he is often antagonistic and prejudiced against Radu, at least during Season One. Harlan is headstrong and the self-appointed leader of the students, acting as pilot on the bridge. However, he is extremely overconfident, which sometimes leads to his endangering the crew. Harlan displays advanced [[martial arts]] and gymnastics skills. Jones is also credited as stunt coordinator in an episode of ''Space Cases''.\n*Catalina ([[Jewel Staite]]) is a rainbow-haired female ship's engineer from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a [[moon]] of [[Saturn]]. Saturnians possess evolved vocal patterns, giving them and Catalina the ability to release destructive sonic screams. Though hers have disabled missiles, floored large attackers and assaulted the ship and all its contents, Catalina considers her powers to be \"nothing\" compared to the really skilled Saturnians who are known to shatter buildings with a single sonic blast. Catalina is often heard using the term \"Grozit\" which appears to be a Saturnian non-vulgar [[Expletive attributive|expletive]], similar in usage to the word \"Heavens,\" in context such as \"Heavens, no/Grozit, no.\" Series co-creator [[Peter David]] has used the curse \"Grozit\" in his ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' novels and ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' comics.  Initially, Catalina carries on conversations with Suzee, a person whom she explains is an invisible friend that no one else can see, but her crewmates initially believe Suzee to be an imaginary friend, despite Catalina's insistence to the contrary. In the Season 1 finale, \"On the Road to Find Out\", Suzee is explicitly revealed to be a real person, played by Rebecca Herbst. It is explained that Suzee existed in another [[dimension]], on a planet called Yensid. In Season One, Catalina explains that their [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]]s are attuned to the same sonic frequency, allowing them to speak and even see each other as though they are in the same room (Catalina even turns to face Suzee as she talks to her). Catalina even tells the others that she can see Suzee, but no one else can. In Season Two, when Suzee and Catalina trade places, Catalina lives at Suzee's home and is not present on the ship in the same manner that Suzee seemed to be during Season One. During the second season, Suzee explains that something blocks off her ability to communicate with Catalina interdimensionally, which may have something to do with the reason why Suzee cannot see Catalina the same way Catalina saw Suzee in Season One. Staite would again play a young engineer on a spaceship years later as [[Kaylee Frye]] in the cult<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8211 |title=The World's Best Space Sci-Fi Ever: Your verdict |date=October 26, 2005 |publisher=New ScientistSpace.com |accessdate=August 6, 2006}}</ref>  television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)#Cult status|Firefly]]''.\n*Radu ([[Kristian Ayre]]) is a being from a planet called Andromeda (most people assume this to mean that he is from the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]). He has no real family, since Andromedans are hatched from eggs. Radu has super-sensitive [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[superhuman strength]], just as all Andromedans do, which was the reason behind the Spungs enslaving them and starting the Andromedan War. Radu suffers from an [[inferiority complex]]; as such, he tries his very hardest to get people to like him. The Andromedan culture is based on uniformity of mind and purpose, making Radu's desire to have a family and be his own person an anomaly of character. Radu has an appreciable sense of direction, which makes him the best candidate for the ship's navigator, forcing him to work in conjunction with the pilot, rival Harlan Band. Andromedans not only possess an internal temperature, but an internal barometric pressure as well. For this reason, when ill, snow may exude from an Andromedan's ears. Radu has a significantly greater molecular density than most humanoids, which accounts for his superior strength, and long hair, which is nearly impossible to cut. In the episode \"Desperately Seeking Suzee,\" when the ''Christa'' is knocked around, and the entire crew is thrust, Radu who stands comfortably still with his arms crossed. He is also more patient, logical and realistic than the rest of the crew, especially Harlan.\n*Bova (Rahi Azizi) is from [[Uranus]]. Members of his race have a small, pronged antenna growing from their forehead which can generate powerful blasts of [[electricity]]. Bova has an incredible [[metabolism]] that supplements his advanced energy production, which is the reason for his incredible appetite. He will eat nearly anything, and is always hungry. Being from Uranus, and thereby \"the butt of every joke,\" he is consistently [[pessimistic]] in every situation, a Uranian cultural trait. Bova is responsible for operating and monitoring the ''Christa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shields. The nature of Bova's name is never explained, but in the Season Two episode \"Long Distance Calls,\" when Bova's father, Benn, calls to speak to his son. This is a reference to science fiction writer [[Ben Bova]].\n*Rosie Ianni (Paige Christina) is from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and has the ability to produce vast amounts of [[heat]] at will. At the beginning of the series, she wears a helmet to help her control this ability, but it falls into disuse in subsequent episodes, revealing her naturally bald head, a trait of Mercurians. Because Mercury is so close to the [[Sun]], all Mercurians have a tendency to \"look on the bright side\" of things, and as a result, Rosie is the mothering influence within the crew, always trying to make sure that her fellow cadets are happy and getting along. She serves as a doctor/scientist as well as acting as the communications officer on the bridge. She has a tendency to adopt seemingly cute things that turn out to be troublesome for the crew. At one point in the series, Rosie temporarily took on the power to generate [[telekinetic]] energy blasts.\n*Thelma (Techno Human EmuLating MAchine) ([[Anik Matern]]), the mysterious ship's only native inhabitant, is an [[android (robot)|android]] who often malfunctions, owing in no small part to the fact that her [[memory]] chip, a small [[Gemstone|gem]] residing in her forehead, is cracked. (It is unclear whether the crystal was cracked when Harlan stepped on it, or if the damage was preexisting.) She has a habit of taking things too [[literal translation|literally]], and often does not realize moderately obvious things. In season 2, her appearance changes to reflect the altered appearance of the Christa following the emergency crash on a planet. Her color changes from copper to silver and her gem changes from amber to sapphire.\n*Suzee ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) is Catalina's best friend, and is believed to be imaginary by the crew throughout Season One. Following Catalina's apparent death at the end of Season One, Suzee joins the crew in her stead. Suzee's hair is similar to Catalina's, but is longer and actually shows up as colored streaks interspersed through her predominantly brunette hair. She is very intelligent (she is said to be \"smarter than a million books\" in the revised opening title sequence that includes her character) and has two sets of [[gills]] just beneath both sides of her [[clavicle]] that allow her to breathe in any [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], though not in the [[vacuum]] of space. A bit overconfident herself, and sometimes at odds with Miss Davenport for being treated like a child despite not officially being one of her students, Suzee is also a [[telepath]] who can read others' minds and project her consciousness into other people's minds in order to possess their bodies. This ability even extends to sentient computers, such as Pezu in the series finale \"A Friend in Need\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=A Friend in Need|series=Space Cases|network=Nickelodeon|season=2|number=13|airdate=January 27, 1997}}</ref> Suzee often acts as a rival to Harlan.  Rosie once accidentally blurts out that Suzee is attracted to Radu.\n*Elmira (Katie Emme McIninch) is a frequent ally of the ''Christa'' crew. She is a Spung [[fortune teller|oracle]] and as such, the crew did not trust her at first (especially Radu). Due to Spung society having a [[sexism|low opinion of their women]], Elmira ran away from home years ago. Despite her upbringing, she is quite gentle and pleasant, if rather secretive. Although Radu at first despises her for her origins, the two grow close and kiss twice. It is revealed in the Season One finale that she is Warlord Shank's daughter. She gives the first foreshadowing of Catalina's later \"death\" when she predicts that someone new will come and Catalina will disappear.\n*Warlord Shank ([[George Takei]]), is a Spung commander who is a deadly space pirate and adversary for the crew of the ''Christa'', having elite Spung officers under his command.

Nearby, an odd [[bird]]-like alien ship appears, and Harlan Band decides to sneak onto it; the other students, all of whom are younger and much less troublesome, follow Harlan onto the ship. During their exploration of the ship's interior, the organic ship bonds to each student when each touches a bulkhead.\n\nTJ Davenport, their teacher and principal, and Commander Seth Goddard go after them and, in a series of unfortunate events, become separated throughout the vessel. One of the students accidentally charges the engines, hurtling the ship off into a spatial rift. By the time everyone figures out that only the children who bonded to the ship can actually control it, the ship has stopped several [[light year]]s away from the Academy. They set off on a return trip which would take them at least seven years, four months, and twenty-two days at maximum speeds.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pilot===\n{{Episode table\n |background      = #bce07c\n |title           =\n |airdate         = 29\n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Breath of a Salesman\n |OriginalAirDate=Unaired\n |ShortSummary=An alien salesman, Yee Haw Jones, boards the ship.\n| LineColor = bce07c\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (1996)===\n{{Episode table\n |background      = #0b1d27\n |overall         = 8\n |title           =\n |director        =\n |writer          =\n |airdate         = \n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=We Gotta Get Out of This Place\n | DirectedBy = John Bell\n | WrittenBy = Peter David, Bill Mumy\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1996|3|02}}\n |ShortSummary=After learning their field test is suspended because they aren't ready, the Space Cases try to prove themselves by making contact with the Christa, an alien ship outside Star Academy.
