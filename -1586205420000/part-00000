{"title_page": "History of the Constitution of the Late Roman Empire", "text_new": "{{Roman government}}\nThe '''History of the Constitution of the Late Roman Empire''' is a study of the ancient [[Roman Empire]] that traces the progression of Roman political development from the abolition of the [[Principate|Roman Principate]] around the year 200 until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE. When [[Diocletian]] became [[Roman Emperor]] in 284 CE, he inherited a [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitution]] that was no longer functioning, and so he enacted the most significant constitutional reforms in over three-hundred years. His reforms, much like those three-hundred years before, were intended to correct the errors in the previous constitution. Diocletian's specific reforms were less radical than was the reality that he exposed the state of government for what it had been for centuries: monarchy.<ref name=\"Abbott, 340\">Abbott, 340</ref> With Diocletian's reforms the [[Principate]] was abolished, and a new system, the [[Dominate]] (Latin: \"lord\" or \"master\"), was established.\n\n==The state of the empire at the end of the Principate==\nBetween the death of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] in 211, and the accession of Diocletian in 284, twenty-three emperors had been installed and then killed. Almost all of these emperors owed their elevation to the force of arms, and were able to maintain power so long as they both kept favour with their armed supporters, and prevented the emergence of a rival. Thus, the army and the [[Praetorian Guard]] became the true power behind the throne.<ref name=\"Abbott, 330\">Abbott, 330</ref> This phenomenon, where the military could act as a political force, illustrated a major constitutional dysfunction, which derived from the fact that there was no universally accepted mechanism to facilitate the installation of new emperors. The result of this chaos was the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] to the throne. While the twenty-three emperors before Diocletian all encountered similar problems, the reign of the emperor [[Gallienus]] can be used as a typical example to illustrate the state of the empire during this period. Gallienus reigned from 260 to 268,<ref name=\"Abbott, 332\">Abbott, 332</ref> and during his reign no part of the empire (other than possibly Africa) escaped devastation at the hands of the barbarians.<ref name=\"Abbott, 332\" /> In the east, the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] had overrun [[Syria]], and captured Gallienus' father and co-emperor, [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]], while in the north, the [[Goths]] invaded Roman territory, and sacked towns as far south as [[Athens]] and [[Corinth]]. Also in the north, the [[Alemanni]] penetrated deep into Roman territory, encountering no serious opposition until they reached [[Ravenna]], while the [[Franks]] passed through [[Gaul]], and sacked towns in [[Spain]]. These invasions were primarily raiding expeditions, and the invaders usually retreated back to their own territory after their lust for booty had been satisfied.<ref name=\"Abbott, 332\" /> While no major loss of territory resulted from these raids, the sacked towns were laid to waste, commerce throughout the empire was devastated, and entire economies collapsed. One consequence of this situation was the emergence of usurpers,<ref name=\"Abbott, 333\">Abbott, 333</ref> who often came in the form of provincial governors. The citizens in the provinces often had a common enemy, and usually could not rely on Rome for protection. Thus, their loyalty to the emperor was seriously impaired, and they turned to their governors for leadership. The governors began assuming titles that did not legally belong to them, which resulted in a virtual dismemberment of the empire.\n\nOne example of these usurpers was Postumus, who was governor of [[Gaul]] (modern France) during Gallienus' reign.<ref name=\"Abbott, 333\" /> After he had driven back an invading army of Franks, his troops saluted him as emperor, and while he did not use his new-found power to march on Rome, he did establish his own empire in Gaul.<ref name=\"Abbott, 333\" /> He established a court, appointed generals, and proclaimed himself Consul and pontifex maximus, which in effect, made his empire in Gaul a mirror image of the Roman Empire. In 268, he was succeeded by another governor, [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]]. Tetricus seems to have added Spain to his empire. In 273, the Roman Emperor [[Aurelian]] forced Tetricus to resign, and re-established Roman rule over his territory. While the rule of Postumus and Tetricus was never formally recognized by Rome, the rule of the governor [[Odaenathus]] over the province of [[Palmyra]] was formally recognized by Rome.<ref name=\"Abbott, 334\">Abbott, 334</ref> Odaenathus made himself king and his wife, Zenobia, queen. Rome did not object to this, and he was given control over Asia, and was allowed to appoint governors and generals. While Odaenathus recognized the authority of the emperor Gallienus, [[Zenobia]] did not, and in 269 she took an army and conquered Egypt. In 271, the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] drove her out of Egypt, and quickly reacquired the province of Palmyra.<ref name=\"Abbott, 334\" />\n\n==The constitution of Diocletian==\nWhen [[Diocletian]] became [[Roman Emperor]] in 284, the military situation had recently stabilized,<ref name=\"Abbott, 334\" /> which allowed him to enact badly needed constitutional reforms. Diocletian resurrected the system that [[Marcus Aurelius]] had first used, and divided the empire into east and west.<ref name=\"Abbott, 339\">Abbott, 339</ref> Each half was to be ruled by one of two co-emperors, called the ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]''. He then resurrected the precedent set by [[Hadrian]], and ensured that each emperor named his successor early in his reign. Diocletian called that successor a ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''.<ref name=\"Abbott, 339\" /> Diocletian then created a bureaucratic apparatus that was similar to the system that Hadrian had created, where each office had a defined set of responsibilities, a set rank, and a set path of promotion. In this administrative system, Diocletian followed the example that had been set by Domitian, and divided the empire into small administrative units.<ref name=\"Abbott, 340\" /> He also assigned to the four tetrarchs (the two ''Augusti'' and the two ''Caesares'') honorary titles and insignia that had been used by [[Domitian]].<ref name=\"Abbott, 340\" /> Diocletian simply took concepts that had either been developed, or were underdeveloped, and streamlined them into a single constitution.<ref name=\"Abbott, 339\" /> One important consequence of these reforms was the fact that the fiction of a free republic finally gave way to naked autocracy. The illusion of shared power between the emperor and Senate was finally extinguished and the centuries-old reality of monarchy became obvious.<ref name=\"Abbott, 340\" />\n\nWhen Diocletian resigned, chaos ensued, but after the chaos had subsided, most of his reforms remained in effect. While the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] enacted some revisions to this constitution, the most significant change over the centuries was in the abolition of the ''Caesares''. Ultimately this constitution survived, in one form or another, until the Roman Empire fell in 476. Diocletian's division of the empire into west and east set the stage for ages to come, and was a significant factor behind the ultimate division of the [[Christian church]] into western [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern [[Greek Orthodox]], while his division of the empire into prefectures and dioceses is used by the Catholic Church to this day.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n* [[Roman Kingdom]]\n* [[Roman Republic]]\n* [[Roman Empire]]\n* [[Roman Law]]\n* [[Plebeian Council]]\n* [[Centuria]]\n|col2 =\n* [[Curia]]\n* [[Roman consul]]\n* [[Praetor]]\n* [[Roman censor]]\n* [[Quaestor]]\n* [[Aedile]]\n|col3 =\n* [[Roman Dictator]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Roman Senate]]\n* [[Cursus honorum]]\n* [[Byzantine Senate]]\n* [[Pontifex Maximus]]\n|col4 =\n* [[Princeps senatus]]\n* [[Interrex]]\n* [[Promagistrate]]\n* [[Acta Senatus]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author=Abbott, Frank Frost|year=1901|title=A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions|publisher=Elibron Classics|isbn=0-543-92749-0}}\n*{{cite book|author=Byrd, Robert|year=1995|title=The Senate of the Roman Republic|publisher=US Government Printing Office Senate Document 103\u201323}}\n*{{cite book|author=Cicero, Marcus Tullius|year=1841|title=The Political Works of Marcus Tullius Cicero: Comprising his Treatise on the Commonwealth; and his Treatise on the Laws|edition=Translated from the original, with Dissertations and Notes in Two Volumes By Francis Barham, Esq|location=London|publisher=Edmund Spettigue|volume=Vol. 1}}\n*{{cite book|author=Holland, Tom|year=2005|title=Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic|publisher=Random House Books|isbn=1-4000-7897-0|url=https://archive.org/details/rubiconlastyears00holl}}\n*{{cite book|author=Lintott, Andrew|year=1999|title=The Constitution of the Roman Republic|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-926108-3}}\n*{{cite book|author=Polybius|year=1823|title=The General History of Polybius: Translated from the Greek|publisher=Oxford: Printed by W.

When [[Diocletian]] became [[Roman Emperor]] in 284 CE, he inherited a [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitution]] that was no longer functioning, and so he enacted the most significant constitutional reforms in over three-hundred years. His reforms, much like those three-hundred years before, were intended to correct the errors in the previous constitution. Diocletian's specific reforms were less radical than was the reality that he exposed the state of government for what it had been for centuries: monarchy.<ref name=\"Abbott, 340\">Abbott, 340</ref> With Diocletian\u2019s reforms the [[Principate]] was abolished, and a new system, the [[Dominate]] (Latin: \"lord\" or \"master\"), was established.\n\n==The state of the empire at the end of the Principate==\nBetween the death of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] in 211, and the accession of Diocletian in 284, twenty-three emperors had been installed and then killed.
