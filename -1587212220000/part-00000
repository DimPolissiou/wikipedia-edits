This is supported by evidence suggesting that [[castration|castrated]] boys do not develop BPH when they age.

On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone.<ref>{{cite web |title = Testosterone and Aging: Clinical Research Directions. |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |publisher = NCBI Bookshelf |accessdate = 2 February 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194336/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |archivedate = 5 November 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), a [[metabolite]] of testosterone, is a critical mediator of prostatic growth. DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the [[enzyme]] [[5\u03b1-reductase]], type 2. DHT can act in an [[autocrine]] fashion on the stromal cells or in [[paracrine]] fashion by diffusing into nearby [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear [[androgen receptor]]s and signals the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[growth factor]]s that are mitogenic to the epithelial and stromal cells. DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly. The importance of DHT in causing [[nodule (medicine)|nodular]] hyperplasia is supported by clinical observations in which an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of 5\u03b1-reductase such as [[finasteride]] is given to men with this condition. Therapy with a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |title = Proscar (finisteride) Prescribing Information |url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |website = FDA \u2013 Drug Documents |publisher = Merck and Company |accessdate = 2 March 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231752/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |archivedate = 3 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Bartsch |first1 = G |last2 = Rittmaster |first2 = RS |last3 = Klocker |first3 = H |title = Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal = World J Urol |date = 2002 |volume = 19 |issue = 6 |pages = 413\u201325 |pmid = 12022710 |doi = 10.1007/s00345-002-0248-5 }}</ref>\n\nTestosterone promotes prostate cell proliferation,<ref name=\"Feldman2001\">{{cite journal |last1 = Feldman |first1 = Brian J. |last2 = Feldman |first2 = David |title = The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer |journal = Nature Reviews Cancer |volume = 1 |issue = 1 |pages = 34\u201345 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11900250 |doi = 10.1038/35094009 }}</ref> but relatively low levels of serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH.<ref name=\"Lagiou1997\">{{cite journal |last1 = Lagiou |first1 = Pagona |last2 = Mantzoros |first2 = Christos S. |last3 = Tzonou |first3 = Anastasia |last4 = Signorello |first4 = Lisa B. |last5 = Lipworth |first5 = Loren |last6 = Trichopoubs |first6 = Dimitrios |title = Serum Steroids in Relation to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia |journal = Oncology |volume = 54 |issue = 6 |pages = 497\u2013501 |year = 1997 |pmid = 9394847 |doi = 10.1159/000227609 }}</ref><ref name=\"Roberts2004\">{{cite journal |last1 = Roberts |first1 = Rosebud O. |last2 = Jacobson |first2 = Debra J. |last3 = Rhodes |first3 = Thomas |last4 = Klee |first4 = George G. |last5 = Leiber |first5 = Michael M. |last6 = Jacobsen |first6 = Steven J. |title = Serum sex hormones and measures of benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal = The Prostate |volume = 61 |issue = 2 |pages = 124\u201331 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15305335 |doi = 10.1002/pros.20080 }}</ref> One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate.<ref name=\"Page2006\">{{cite journal |last1 = Page |first1 = S.

However, repeated contractions and dilations of myofibers will unavoidably cause injuries and broken myofibers. Myofibers have a low potential for regeneration; therefore, collagen fibers need to be used to replace the broken myofibers. Such misrepairs make the muscular tissue weak in functioning, and the fluid secreted by glands cannot be excreted completely. Then, the accumulation of fluid in glands increases the resistance of muscular tissue during the movements of contractions and dilations, and more and more myofibers will be broken and replaced by collagen fibers.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\n[[File:Benign prostate hyperplasia.jpg|thumb|right|Benign prostate hyperplasia]]\nAs men age, the enzymes [[aromatase]] and [[5-alpha reductase]] increase in activity.

The earliest microscopic signs of BPH usually begin between the age of 30 and 50 years old in the PUG, which is posterior to the proximal urethra.<ref name=Wasserman /><sup>:694</sup> In BPH, the majority of growth occurs in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate.<ref name=Wasserman /><sup>:694</sup> In addition to these two classic areas, the peripheral zone (PZ) is also involved to a lesser extent.<ref name=Wasserman /><sup>:695</sup> Prostatic cancer typically occurs in the PZ. However, BPH nodules, usually from the TZ are often biopsied anyway to rule out cancer in the TZ.<ref name=Wasserman /><sup>:695</sup>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe clinical diagnosis of BPH is based on a history of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), a digital rectal exam, and exclusion of other causes of similar signs and symptoms. The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond to the size of the prostate. An enlarged prostate gland on [[rectal examination]] that is symmetric and smooth supports a diagnosis of BPH.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or nodular, this raises concern for prostate cancer.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" />\n\n[[Urinalysis]] is typically performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate for signs of a urinary tract infection, [[glycosuria|glucose in the urine]] (suggestive of diabetes), or [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]] (suggestive of kidney disease).<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Bloodwork including [[Renal function|kidney function tests]] and [[prostate specific antigen]] (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> However, checking blood PSA levels for [[prostate cancer screening]] is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Ultrasound examination of the [[testes]], prostate, and [[kidney]]s is often performed, again to rule out [[cancer]] and [[hydronephrosis]].\n\nValidated questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] (I-PSS), and more recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia) are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Parsons |first1 = JK |title = Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Epidemiology and Risk Factors. |journal = Current Bladder Dysfunction Reports |date = December 2010 |volume = 5 |issue = 4 |pages = 212\u2013218 |pmid = 21475707 |doi = 10.1007/s11884-010-0067-2 |pmc = 3061630 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Eid |first1 = K |last2 = Krughoff |first2 = K |last3 = Stoimenova |first3 = D |last4 = Smith |first4 = D |last5 = Phillips |first5 = J |last6 = O'Donnell |first6 = C |last7 = Barqawi |first7 = A |title = Validation of the Urgency, Weak stream, Incomplete emptying, and Nocturia (UWIN) score compared with the American Urological Association Symptoms Score in assessing lower urinary tract symptoms in the clinical setting. |journal = Urology |date = January 2014 |volume = 83 |issue = 1 |pages = 181\u20135 |pmid = 24139351 |doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2013.08.039 }}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n==== Medical conditions ====\nThe differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as [[bladder cancer]], urinary tract infection, [[urethral stricture]], [[Ureterolithiasis|urethral calculi (stones)]], [[chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|chronic prostatitis]], and prostate cancer.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> [[Neurogenic bladder]] can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms similar to those of BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the [[central nervous system]] such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], and [[alcoholic neuropathy|alcohol-induced nerve damage]].<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Individuals affected by [[heart failure]] often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" />\n\n==== Medications ====\nCertain medications can increase urination difficulties by increasing bladder outlet resistance due to increased [[smooth muscle]] tone at the prostate or bladder neck and contribute to LUTS.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist]] medications, such as [[decongestant]]s with [[pseudoephedrine]] can increase bladder outlet resistance.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> In contrast, [[calcium channel blocker]]s and [[anticholinergic]] medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" /> Diuretic medications such as [[loop diuretic]]s (e.g., [[furosemide]]) or [[thiazide]]s (e.g., [[chlorthalidone]]) can cause or worsen urinary frequency and nighttime awakenings to urinate.<ref name=\"Kim2016\" />\n\n<center><gallery>\nFile:Nodular hyperplasia of the prostate.jpg|[[Micrograph]] showing nodular hyperplasia (left off center) of the prostate from a [[transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP).

DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the [[enzyme]] [[5\u03b1-reductase]], type 2. DHT can act in an [[autocrine]] fashion on the stromal cells or in [[paracrine]] fashion by diffusing into nearby [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear [[androgen receptor]]s and signals the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[growth factor]]s that are mitogenic to the epithelial and stromal cells. DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly. The importance of DHT in causing [[nodule (medicine)|nodular]] hyperplasia is supported by clinical observations in which an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of 5\u03b1-reductase such as [[finasteride]] is given to men with this condition. Therapy with a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |title = Proscar (finisteride) Prescribing Information |url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |website = FDA \u2013 Drug Documents |publisher = Merck and Company |accessdate = 2 March 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231752/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |archivedate = 3 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Bartsch |first1 = G |last2 = Rittmaster |first2 = RS |last3 = Klocker |first3 = H |title = Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal = World J Urol |date = 2002 |volume = 19 |issue = 6 |pages = 413\u201325 |pmid = 12022710 |doi = 10.1007/s00345-002-0248-5 }}</ref>\n\nTestosterone promotes prostate cell proliferation,<ref name=\"Feldman2001\">{{cite journal |last1 = Feldman |first1 = Brian J. |last2 = Feldman |first2 = David |title = The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer |journal = Nature Reviews Cancer |volume = 1 |issue = 1 |pages = 34\u201345 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11900250 |doi = 10.1038/35094009 }}</ref> but relatively low levels of serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH.<ref name=\"Lagiou1997\">{{cite journal |last1 = Lagiou |first1 = Pagona |last2 = Mantzoros |first2 = Christos S. |last3 = Tzonou |first3 = Anastasia |last4 = Signorello |first4 = Lisa B. |last5 = Lipworth |first5 = Loren |last6 = Trichopoubs |first6 = Dimitrios |title = Serum Steroids in Relation to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia |journal = Oncology |volume = 54 |issue = 6 |pages = 497\u2013501 |year = 1997 |pmid = 9394847 |doi = 10.1159/000227609 }}</ref><ref name=\"Roberts2004\">{{cite journal |last1 = Roberts |first1 = Rosebud O. |last2 = Jacobson |first2 = Debra J. |last3 = Rhodes |first3 = Thomas |last4 = Klee |first4 = George G. |last5 = Leiber |first5 = Michael M. |last6 = Jacobsen |first6 = Steven J. |title = Serum sex hormones and measures of benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal = The Prostate |volume = 61 |issue = 2 |pages = 124\u201331 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15305335 |doi = 10.1002/pros.20080 }}</ref> One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate.<ref name=\"Page2006\">{{cite journal |last1 = Page |first1 = S.
