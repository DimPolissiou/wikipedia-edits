{"title_page": "Timeline of the American Revolution", "text_new": "'''Timeline of the American Revolution''' \u2014 [[timeline]] of the political upheaval culminating in the 18th century in which [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] joined together for independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British Empire]], and after victory in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] combined to form the [[United States|United States of America]]. The [[American Revolution]] includes political, social, and military aspects. The revolutionary era is generally considered to have begun with the passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765 and ended with the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. The military phase of the revolution, the American Revolutionary War, lasted from 1775 to 1783.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==1600s==\n===1629===\n*The [[Cambridge Agreement]] (August 29, 1629) stipulates that the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] will be under [[Local government|local control]] in [[New England]].\n===1681===\n*The [[Board of Trade|Lords of Trade]] issues [[quo warranto]] writs for the charters of several North American colonies, including Massachusetts.\n===1684===\n*[[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Revocation of the Charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (June 18). The Massachusetts writ is never served for technical reasons, and the agreement is formally vacated when the chancery court issues a [[scire facias]] writ formally annulling the charter.

France cedes most of its territories in North America to Great Britain, but [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the [[Mississippi River]] is ceded to [[Spain]]. \n*Previously [[Franco-Indian alliance|allied with France]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the Great Lakes region resist the policies of the British under Amherst. [[Pontiac's War|Pontiac's Rebellion]] begins, lasting until 1766.\n*King George's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] (October 7) establishes administration in territories newly ceded by France. To prevent further violence between settlers and Native Americans, the Proclamation sets a western boundary on the American colonies.\n*The [[Navigation Acts]] are re-enforced by [[George Grenville]] as a part of his attempt to reassert unified economic control over the [[British Empire]] following the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\n===1764===\n*The [[Sugar Act]] (April 5), intended to raise revenues, and the [[Currency Act]] (September 1), prohibiting the colonies from issuing paper money, are passed by [[Great Britain|Parliament]]. These Acts, coming during the economic slump that followed the French and Indian War, are resented by the colonists and lead to protests.\n\n===1765===\n* To help defray the cost of keeping troops in America, Parliament enacts (March 22) the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], imposing a tax on many types of printed materials used in the colonies. Seen as a violation of rights, the Act sparks violent demonstrations in several Colonies. Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] adopts (May 29) the [[Virginia Resolves]] claiming that, under British law, Virginians could be taxed only by an assembly to which they had elected representatives. \n* Delegates from nine colonies attend the [[Stamp Act Congress]] which adopts (October 19) a [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]] and petitions Parliament and the king to repeal the Act. \n* Parliament enacts (March 24) the [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]], requiring the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonies]] to provide housing, food, and other provisions to British troops. The act is resisted or circumvented in most of the colonies. In 1767 and again in 1769, Parliament suspended the  governor and legislature of [[Province of New York|New York]] for failure to comply.\n\n===1766===\n*The British Parliament repeals (March 18) the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of the previous year, but, in the simultaneous [[Declaratory Act]], asserts its \"full power and authority to make laws and statutes ... to bind the colonies and people of America ... in all cases whatsoever\".\n*[[Liberty pole|Liberty Pole]] erected in New York City commons in celebration of the Stamp Act repeal (May 21). An intermittent skirmish with the British garrison over the removal of this and other poles, and their replacement by the [[Sons of Liberty]], rages until the [[Province of New York]] is under the control of the revolutionary [[New York Provincial Congress]] in 1775\n\n===1767===\n*The [[Townshend Acts]], named for [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Charles Townshend]], are passed by Parliament (June 29), placing duties on many items imported  into America.\n\n===1768===\n* In April, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Hillsborough, orders colonial governors to stop their own assemblies from endorsing [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Adams' circular letter]]. Hillsborough also orders the governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the general court if the Massachusetts assembly does not revoke the letter. By month's end, the assemblies of New Hampshire, Connecticut and New Jersey have endorsed the letter.\n* In May, a British warship, {{HMS|Romney|1762|6}}, armed with 50 cannon sails into Boston harbor after a call for help from custom commissioners who are constantly being harassed by Boston agitators. In June, a customs official is locked up in the cabin of ''Liberty'', a [[sloop]] owned by John Hancock. Imported wine is then unloaded illegally into Boston without payment of duties. Following this incident, customs officials seize Hancock's sloop. After threats of violence from Bostonians, the customs officials escape to an island off Boston, then request the intervention of British troops.\n* In July, the governor of Massachusetts dissolves the general court after the legislature defies his order to revoke Adams' circular letter. In August, in Boston and New York, merchants agree to boycott most British goods until the Townshend Acts are repealed. In September, at a town meeting in Boston, residents are urged to arm themselves. Later in September, British warships sail into Boston Harbor, then two regiments of British infantry land in Boston and set up permanent residence to keep order.\n\n===1769===\n*''To the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York'' broadside published by the local [[Sons of Liberty]] (c.

The [[American Revolution]] includes political, social, and military aspects. The revolutionary era is generally considered to have begun with the passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765 and ended with the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. The military phase of the revolution, the American Revolutionary War, lasted from 1775 to 1783.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==1600s==\n===1629===\n*The [[Cambridge Agreement]] (August 29, 1629) stipulates that the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] will be under [[Local government|local control]] in [[New England]].\n===1681===\n*The [[Board of Trade|Lords of Trade]] issues [[quo warranto]] writs for the charters of several North American colonies, including Massachusetts.\n===1684===\n*[[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Revocation of the Charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (June 18).

France cedes most of its territories in North America to Great Britain, but [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the [[Mississippi River]] is ceded to [[Spain]]. \n*Previously [[Franco-Indian alliance|allied with France]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the Great Lakes region resist the policies of the British under Amherst. [[Pontiac's War|Pontiac's Rebellion]] begins, lasting until 1766.\n*King George's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] (October 7) establishes administration in territories newly ceded by France. To prevent further violence between settlers and Native Americans, the Proclamation sets a western boundary on the American colonies.\n*The [[Navigation Acts]] are re-enforced by [[George Grenville]] as a part of his attempt to reassert unified economic control over the [[British Empire]] following the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\n===1764===\n*The [[Sugar Act]] (April 5), intended to raise revenues, and the [[Currency Act]] (September 1), prohibiting the colonies from issuing paper money, are passed by [[Great Britain|Parliament]]. These Acts, coming during the economic slump that followed the French and Indian War, are resented by the colonists and lead to protests.\n\n===1765===\n* To help defray the cost of keeping troops in America, Parliament enacts (March 22) the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], imposing a tax on many types of printed materials used in the colonies. Seen as a violation of rights, the Act sparks violent demonstrations in several Colonies. Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] adopts (May 29) the [[Virginia Resolves]] claiming that, under British law, Virginians could be taxed only by an assembly to which they had elected representatives. \n* Delegates from nine colonies attend the [[Stamp Act Congress]] which adopts (October 19) a [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]] and petitions Parliament and the king to repeal the Act. \n* Parliament enacts (March 24) the [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]], requiring the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonies]] to provide housing, food, and other provisions to British troops. The act is resisted or circumvented in most of the colonies. In 1767 and again in 1769, Parliament suspended the  governor and legislature of [[Province of New York|New York]] for failure to comply.\n\n===1766===\n*The British Parliament repeals (March 18) the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of the previous year, but, in the simultaneous [[Declaratory Act]], asserts its \"full power and authority to make laws and statutes ... to bind the colonies and people of America ... in all cases whatsoever\".\n*[[Liberty pole|Liberty Pole]] erected in New York City commons in celebration of the Stamp Act repeal (May 21). An intermittent skirmish with the British garrison over the removal of this and other poles, and their replacement by the [[Sons of Liberty]], rages until the [[Province of New York]] is under the control of the revolutionary [[New York Provincial Congress]] in 1775\n\n===1767===\n*The [[Townshend Acts]], named for [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Charles Townshend]], are passed by Parliament (June 29), placing duties on many items imported  into America.\n\n===1768===\n* In April, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Hillsborough, orders colonial governors to stop their own assemblies from endorsing [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Adams' circular letter]]. Hillsborough also orders the governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the general court if the Massachusetts assembly does not revoke the letter. By month's end, the assemblies of New Hampshire, Connecticut and New Jersey have endorsed the letter.\n* In May, a British warship, {{HMS|Romney|1762|6}}, armed with 50 cannon sails into Boston harbor after a call for help from custom commissioners who are constantly being harassed by Boston agitators. In June, a customs official is locked up in the cabin of ''Liberty'', a [[sloop]] owned by John Hancock. Imported wine is then unloaded illegally into Boston without payment of duties. Following this incident, customs officials seize Hancock's sloop. After threats of violence from Bostonians, the customs officials escape to an island off Boston, then request the intervention of British troops.\n* In July, the governor of Massachusetts dissolves the general court after the legislature defies his order to revoke Adams' circular letter. In August, in Boston and New York, merchants agree to boycott most British goods until the Townshend Acts are repealed. In September, at a town meeting in Boston, residents are urged to arm themselves. Later in September, British warships sail into Boston Harbor, then two regiments of British infantry land in Boston and set up permanent residence to keep order.\n\n===1769===\n*''To the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York'' broadside published by the local [[Sons of Liberty]] (c.

{"title_page": "Prick (slang)", "text_new": "{{italictitle}}\n'''''Prick'''''  is a [[Vulgarism|vulgar]] word for [[Adam Dayani]] as well as a [[pejorative]] term used to refer to a despicable or contemptible individual. It is generally considered offensive, though in the past it has been used as a term of endearment. Its history as a [[euphemism]] for penis goes back to the 1500s and has been used in [[wordplay]] by [[Shakespeare]] and other writers who have combined the vulgarism with the standard meaning of the noun, which means the act of piercing or puncturing. Most linguists believe it has only been used as a direct insult since 1929.\n\n==Definition and general usage==\n\nModern dictionaries agree on prick as a euphemism for penis. But they offer some slight variations in the use of  prick as an insult.  The ''Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang'' says a prick is: \"a despicable man, a fool, used as a general term of offense or contempt. Often as an abusive form of address, always of a male or an inanimate object.\"<ref name=Dalzell>Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor Routledge, ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', 27 November 2014</ref> Similarly [[The Oxford Dictionary of English]] says \"a stupid or contemptible man.\"<ref name=Oxford>Angus Stevenson, ''Oxford Dictionary of English'',  OUP Oxford, 19 August 2010</ref> [[Merriam Webster]] offers \"a spiteful or contemptible man often having some authority.\"<ref name=Merriam>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prick |title=Prick &#124; Definition of Prick |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nPeter Silverton notes that the way a person calls another person a  prick, which can range from disdain to anger, will help to define its meaning: \"Said lightly, it's a jerk or a bumbler. Said with a harsher punchier intonation it can mean something far nastier.  Say, 'Don't be such a prick' vs.  'You prick!'\"<ref>Peter Silverton, ''Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing'', Portobello Books, 3 November 2011</ref>\n\nIn modern times, says Tony Thorne, \"in polite company it is the least acceptable of  the many terms for the male member (''cock'', ''tool,'' etc.), it is nevertheless commonly used, together with [[Dick (slang)|dick]], by women in preference to those alternatives.\"<ref name=thorne>Tony Thorne , ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle ages to 18th century===\n\n[[File:First Folio, Shakespeare - 0203.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest uses of prick can be found in Shakespeare's [[As You Like It]]]]\n\nThe word comes from the [[Middle English]] ''prikke'', which originates in the [[Old English]], ''prica'' \"point, puncture, particle, small portion of space or time.\" The meaning of prick as a 'pointed weapon' or 'dagger' is first noted in the 1550s.<ref name=etymology>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=prick |title=prick (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> Prick as a verb for sexual intercourse can be seen as early as the 14th century, in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s  ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref name=Green>Johnathan Green, The Vulgar Tongue, Green's History of Slang. p. 24.</ref> The Oxford English Dictionary records the first use of the word prick as penis in 1592, although it was  probably used in the spoken language for some time before. It was \"probably coined with the image of a thorn in mind from the shape and image of penetration evoked\", says Thorne.<ref name=thorne /> The earliest use of the noun prick as penis is observed in the works of Shakespeare, who uses it playfully several times as a [[double entendre]] with the non-sexual meaning of prick, i.e., \"the act of puncturing\" as in the following examples:<ref name=Hughes>Geoffrey Hughes, An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, and Ethnic Slurs in the English-speaking World Routledge, 26 March 2015, p. 89</ref>\n\n<blockquote>He that sweetest rose will find/must find love's prick and Rosalinde. - Touchstone the Clown, in ''[[As You Like It]]''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon. - [[Mercutio]], in [[Romeo and Juliet]]. </blockquote>\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, \"my prick\" was used as a term of endearment by 'immodest maids' for their boyfriends.<ref name=etymology/>\n\nThe word is listed in [[Francis Grose]]'s ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' as \"prick: the virile member\" in 1788.<ref>Francis Grose, A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, S. Hooper, 1788</ref>\n\nA popular saying during the 18th century was: \"May your prick and your purse never fail you.\"<ref name=Routledge>Eric Partridge, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang'', Routledge, 2 September 2003, p. 288</ref>\n\n===19th to 20th centuries===\n\n[[File:My Secret Life title page.png|150px|left|thumb| [[My Secret Life (memoir)|My Secret Life]]]]\n\nIn the [[Victorian Era]], the slang form of prick was hidden away from most \"respectable\" literature.<ref name=Dalzell/>  Even earlier, an 1807 edition of ''The Family Shakespeare'' eliminated the 'prick' verse from ''As You Like It'', and continued without it in subsequent editions.  In 1861 at least one version of Shakespeare had replaced prick with thorn.<ref name=Hughes/>  However, prick continued to appear in Victorian pornography such as Walter's ''[[My Secret Life (memoir)|My Secret Life]]'', who used it 253 times,<ref name=Green/> as well as in the works of Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]], who used it with 'vulgar good humour'.<ref name=Dalzell />\n\nPrick started to take on the sense of 'fool' or contemptible person in the 19th century, usually preceded by 'silly'. \"The semantic association between stupidity and terms for the penis is noticeably strong\" notes Hughes.<ref name=Hughes/> Silverton observes that \"whereas the French place idiocy with the vagina, the [[Yiddish]] and English place it with the penis, with [[shmuck]] and prick.\"<ref>Peter Silverton, Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing,  Portobello Books, 3 November 2011</ref>\n\nIn Farmer and Henley's ''A Dictionary of Slang and Colloquial English'' in 1905, the two definitions of prick are \"a term of endearment (1540)\", or \"a pimple\".<ref>Farmer and Henley, A Dictionary of Slang and Colloquial English, 1905, p. 352</ref>\n\nMost linguists cite 1929 in the United States as the time and place when prick began to be used as a direct insult, as in \"You prick!\" or \"What a prick!\" This was also the time when similar sexual euphemisms, like [[cunt]] (1928) and [[twat]] (1929) became direct insults. Dick's history is reversed: \n''Dick'' as \"fool\" has been recorded since the 16th century but as penis only since about 1888.<ref name=Hughes/> In ''The Life of Slang'', Coleman notes the use of Prick as a stupid or contemptible person as early as 1882.<ref>Julie Coleman, The Life of Slang, OUP Oxford, 8 March 2012</ref>\n\nWhen used with the word 'silly' however, as in 'Silly prick!' the word has continued to be viewed as fairly inoffensive.<ref name=Dalzell/>\n\n==Modern usage==\n===Popular expressions===\nBy the 20th and 21st centuries, several expressions related to prick were being used.\n\n\"To look at every woman through a hole in one's prick\" refers to a man who views every woman as a potential instrument of sexual pleasure.<ref name=Routledge/>\n\nA short stout person has sometimes been described as \"short and thick like a Welshman's prick.\"<ref name=Routledge/>\n\nIn [[Cockney rhyming slang]], a penis is described as a \"Hampton Wick\", a \"Hampton\" or a \"wick\"  because it rhymes with \"prick\".<ref name=Dalzell/>\n\nAn English [[proverb]] says \"A standing prick has no conscience\".<ref name=Routledge/>\n\n===Education===\nIn ''Pedagogical Desire: Authority, Seducation, Transference, and the Question of Ethics'', Jan Jagodzinski emphasizes the association of ''prick'' with authority figures in his chapter, \"The Teacher as Prick\", but also allows that teachers can refer to students as 'little pricks.'<ref name=Jan>Jan Jagodzinski,''Pedagogical Desire: Authority, Seducation, Transference, and the Question of Ethics'', IAP, 2006</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\nBy the mid-20th century, \"prick\" had enthusiastically returned to literature from its Victorian banishment, and was being used liberally both as a description for penis and as an insult. [[Philip Roth]] used it frequently in ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'', with an oft-cited quote being his inclusion of the Yiddish proverb:  \"When the prick stands up, the brain gets buried.\" [[Darryl Ponicsan]] uses it to [[alliterative]] effect in \"We can be just three sailors together, or we can be a prisoner and two pricks\" in ''The Last Detail''.

It is generally considered offensive, though in the past it has been used as a term of endearment. Its history as a [[euphemism]] for penis goes back to the 1500s and has been used in [[wordplay]] by [[Shakespeare]] and other writers who have combined the vulgarism with the standard meaning of the noun, which means the act of piercing or puncturing. Most linguists believe it has only been used as a direct insult since 1929.\n\n==Definition and general usage==\n\nModern dictionaries agree on prick as a euphemism for penis. But they offer some slight variations in the use of  prick as an insult.  The ''Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang'' says a prick is: \"a despicable man, a fool, used as a general term of offense or contempt. Often as an abusive form of address, always of a male or an inanimate object.\"<ref name=Dalzell>Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor Routledge, ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', 27 November 2014</ref> Similarly [[The Oxford Dictionary of English]] says \"a stupid or contemptible man.\"<ref name=Oxford>Angus Stevenson, ''Oxford Dictionary of English'',  OUP Oxford, 19 August 2010</ref> [[Merriam Webster]] offers \"a spiteful or contemptible man often having some authority.\"<ref name=Merriam>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prick |title=Prick &#124; Definition of Prick |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nPeter Silverton notes that the way a person calls another person a  prick, which can range from disdain to anger, will help to define its meaning: \"Said lightly, it's a jerk or a bumbler. Said with a harsher punchier intonation it can mean something far nastier.  Say, 'Don't be such a prick' vs.  'You prick!'\"<ref>Peter Silverton, ''Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing'', Portobello Books, 3 November 2011</ref>\n\nIn modern times, says Tony Thorne, \"in polite company it is the least acceptable of  the many terms for the male member (''cock'', ''tool,'' etc.), it is nevertheless commonly used, together with [[Dick (slang)|dick]], by women in preference to those alternatives.\"<ref name=thorne>Tony Thorne , ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle ages to 18th century===\n\n[[File:First Folio, Shakespeare - 0203.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest uses of prick can be found in Shakespeare's [[As You Like It]]]]\n\nThe word comes from the [[Middle English]] ''prikke'', which originates in the [[Old English]], ''prica'' \"point, puncture, particle, small portion of space or time.\" The meaning of prick as a 'pointed weapon' or 'dagger' is first noted in the 1550s.<ref name=etymology>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=prick |title=prick (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> Prick as a verb for sexual intercourse can be seen as early as the 14th century, in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s  ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref name=Green>Johnathan Green, The Vulgar Tongue, Green's History of Slang. p. 24.</ref> The Oxford English Dictionary records the first use of the word prick as penis in 1592, although it was  probably used in the spoken language for some time before. It was \"probably coined with the image of a thorn in mind from the shape and image of penetration evoked\", says Thorne.<ref name=thorne /> The earliest use of the noun prick as penis is observed in the works of Shakespeare, who uses it playfully several times as a [[double entendre]] with the non-sexual meaning of prick, i.e., \"the act of puncturing\" as in the following examples:<ref name=Hughes>Geoffrey Hughes, An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, and Ethnic Slurs in the English-speaking World Routledge, 26 March 2015, p. 89</ref>\n\n<blockquote>He that sweetest rose will find/must find love's prick and Rosalinde. - Touchstone the Clown, in ''[[As You Like It]]''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon. - [[Mercutio]], in [[Romeo and Juliet]]. </blockquote>\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, \"my prick\" was used as a term of endearment by 'immodest maids' for their boyfriends.<ref name=etymology/>\n\nThe word is listed in [[Francis Grose]]'s ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' as \"prick: the virile member\" in 1788.<ref>Francis Grose, A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, S.

He began his career directing television in Canada and later in the U.S. By the late 1950s he began directing films, most often comedies. He also directed dramas and romantic subjects, such as [[Love Story (1970 film)|''Love Story'']] (1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars.\n\nHiller collaborated on films with screenwriters [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and [[Neil Simon]]. Among his other films were ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964), [[Tobruk (1967 film)|''Tobruk'']] (1967), ''[[The Hospital]]'' (1971), [[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|''The Out-of-Towners'']] (1970), [[Plaza Suite (film)|''Plaza Suite'']] (1971), ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'' (1975), [[Silver Streak (film)|''Silver Streak'']] (1976), [[The In-Laws (1979 film)|''The In-Laws'']] (1979) and [[Outrageous Fortune (film)|''Outrageous Fortune'']] (1987).\n\nHiller served as president of the [[Directors Guild of America]] from 1989 to 1993 and president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] from 1993 to 1997. He was the recipient of the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] in 2002. An annual film festival in Hiller's honor was held from 2006 until 2009 at his alma mater, [[Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts]].\n\n==Early life and military service==\nHiller was born in November 1923 in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, the son of Rose (Garfin) and Harry Hiller. His family was [[Jews|Jewish]], and had emigrated from [[Poland]] in 1912. He had two sisters, one thirteen years older and one eleven years older. His father operated a second-hand musical instruments store in Edmonton. Hiller recalled that when he occasionally traveled home while he was in college, the Black people he met with \"treated me like a king. Why? Because they loved my father. They told me that unlike other shopkeepers, he treated them like normal folks when they went to his store. He didn't look down on them\".<ref>Grodin, Charles. ''If I Only Knew Then&nbsp;... Learning from Our Mistakes'', Springboard Press (2007) p. 78</ref>\n\nAlthough his parents were not professionals in theater or had much money, notes Hiller, they enjoyed putting on a Jewish play once or twice a year for the Jewish community of 450 people, mainly to keep in touch with their heritage. Hiller recalls they started up the Yiddish theater when he was seven or eight years old; he helped set carpenters build and decorate the sets. When he was eleven, he got a role acting as an old man, wearing a long beard and the [[payot]]. He says that \"the love of theater and music and literature my parents instilled in me\" contributed to his later choosing to direct TV and films.<ref>King, Alan.

This was followed by the comedy ''[[Promise Her Anything]]'' (1965), with [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Penelope (1966 film)|''Penelope'']] (1966), starring [[Natalie Wood]]. In a move away from comedy, he directed the desert warfare drama, [[Tobruk (1967 film)|''Tobruk'']] (1967), starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[George Peppard]], about a [[North African Campaign]] during [[World War II]]. The film was nominated for one Academy Award and showed Hiller capable of handling action films as well as comedy.<ref name=Allon/> Around the same time, he returned to comedy with ''[[The Tiger Makes Out]]'' (also 1967), starring [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Anne Jackson]], and featured [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s film debut. ''[[Popi]]'' (1969), recounts the tale of a Puerto Rican widower, starring [[Alan Arkin]], struggling to raise his two young sons in the New York City neighborhood known as [[Spanish Harlem]].

The [[American Film Institute]] ranks it No. 9 in their list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions|greatest love stories]]. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] disagreed with some critics who felt the story was too contrived:<ref name=Ebert/> \"Why shouldn't we get a little misty during a story about young lovers separated by death?

Schell played the role of a man trying to deal with questions of self-identity and guilt as a survivor of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during World War II.

He began his career directing television in Canada and later in the U.S. By the late 1950s he began directing films, most often comedies. He also directed dramas and romantic subjects, such as [[Love Story (1970 film)|''Love Story'']] (1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars.\n\nHiller collaborated on films with screenwriters [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and [[Neil Simon]]. Among his other films were ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964), [[Tobruk (1967 film)|''Tobruk'']] (1967), ''[[The Hospital]]'' (1971), [[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|''The Out-of-Towners'']] (1970), [[Plaza Suite (film)|''Plaza Suite'']] (1971), ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'' (1975), [[Silver Streak (film)|''Silver Streak'']] (1976), [[The In-Laws (1979 film)|''The In-Laws'']] (1979) and [[Outrageous Fortune (film)|''Outrageous Fortune'']] (1987).\n\nHiller served as president of the [[Directors Guild of America]] from 1989 to 1993 and president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] from 1993 to 1997. He was the recipient of the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] in 2002. An annual film festival in Hiller's honor was held from 2006 until 2009 at his alma mater, [[Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts]].\n\n==Early life and military service==\nHiller was born in November 1923 in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, the son of Rose (Garfin) and Harry Hiller. His family was [[Jews|Jewish]], and had emigrated from [[Poland]] in 1912. He had two sisters, one thirteen years older and one eleven years older. His father operated a second-hand musical instruments store in Edmonton. Hiller recalled that when he occasionally traveled home while he was in college, the Black people he met with \"treated me like a king. Why? Because they loved my father. They told me that unlike other shopkeepers, he treated them like normal folks when they went to his store. He didn't look down on them\".<ref>Grodin, Charles. ''If I Only Knew Then&nbsp;... Learning from Our Mistakes'', Springboard Press (2007) p. 78</ref>\n\nAlthough his parents were not professionals in theater or had much money, notes Hiller, they enjoyed putting on a Jewish play once or twice a year for the Jewish community of 450 people, mainly to keep in touch with their heritage. Hiller recalls they started up the Yiddish theater when he was seven or eight years old; he helped set carpenters build and decorate the sets. When he was eleven, he got a role acting as an old man, wearing a long beard and the [[payot]]. He says that \"the love of theater and music and literature my parents instilled in me\" contributed to his later choosing to direct TV and films.<ref>King, Alan. ''Matzo Balls for Breakfast: and Other Memories of Growing Up Jewish'', Simon & Schuster (2004) p. 215</ref>\n\nAfter he graduated from high school, he joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in 1941 during [[World War II]]. He served as a navigator on four-engine [[Handley Page Halifax]] heavy bombers on night missions over Nazi-controlled territory in Europe.<ref name=WWII>http://www.dominion.ca/Downloads/sor_ArthurHiller.pdf</ref> After he returned from serving in the military, Hiller enrolled in and later graduated from [[University College, Toronto]] with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. After Israel was declared a state in 1948, he and his wife unsuccessfully tried to join its army since it came under attack.{{efn|He said that \"Israel was immediately attacked by five different Arab armies&nbsp;... I volunteered, but they turned me down because I was married. I drove down to Seattle to try to volunteer from the United States, but again was turned down because I was married.

Over the next few years, his work for the small screen included episodes of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', [[Naked City (TV series)|''Naked City'']], [[Perry Mason]], and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''.<ref name=Allon>{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Jacqueline|editor1-last=Allon|editor1-first=Yoram|editor2-last= Cullen|editor2-first=Del|editor3-last=Patterson| editor3-first=Hannah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifl0AkO-KeIC&pg=PA243|title=Contemporary North American Film Directorslocation=London|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2001|pages=243\u201344|isbn=9781903364529}}</ref>\n\n===1950s\u20131960s===\nHiller directed his first film, ''[[The Careless Years]]'' (1957), the story of young couple eloping. This was followed by ''[[This Rugged Land]]'' (1962), originally made for television but then released as a film, and then ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]'' (1963), a Disney film. With these first films, Hiller already showed competence in directing unrelated subjects successfully.<ref name=Allon/>\n\nHe next directed a satirical anti-war comedy by screenwriter [[Paddy Chayefsky]], ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964), starring [[James Garner]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. It was the first of two film collaborations with Chayevsky. The film, nominated for two Academy Awards, would establish Hiller as a notable Hollywood director and, according to critics, \"earned him a reputation for flair with sophisticated comedy.\"<ref name=Allon/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that Hiller's \"brisk direction\" of Chayefsky's script included some \"remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence.\"<ref>Crowther, Bosley.

This was followed by the comedy ''[[Promise Her Anything]]'' (1965), with [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Penelope (1966 film)|''Penelope'']] (1966), starring [[Natalie Wood]]. In a move away from comedy, he directed the desert warfare drama, [[Tobruk (1967 film)|''Tobruk'']] (1967), starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[George Peppard]], about a [[North African Campaign]] during [[World War II]]. The film was nominated for one Academy Award and showed Hiller capable of handling action films as well as comedy.<ref name=Allon/> Around the same time, he returned to comedy with ''[[The Tiger Makes Out]]'' (also 1967), starring [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Anne Jackson]], and featured [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s film debut. ''[[Popi]]'' (1969), recounts the tale of a Puerto Rican widower, starring [[Alan Arkin]], struggling to raise his two young sons in the New York City neighborhood known as [[Spanish Harlem]].

The defender is not allowed to make contact with the offensive player's hand (unless the defender is also in contact with the ball) or a ''[[Foul (basketball)|foul]]'' is called. In order to be legal, the block must occur while the shot is traveling upward or at its apex. A deflected field goal that is made does not count as a blocked shot and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team. For the shooter, a blocked shot is counted as a missed field goal attempt. Also, on a shooting foul, a blocked shot cannot be awarded or counted, even if the player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who committed the foul. If the ball is heading downward when the defender hits it, it is ruled as [[goaltending]] and counts as a made basket. Goaltending is also called if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard ([[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] excepted; the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009\u201310 season).\n\nNicknames for blocked shots include \"rejections,\" \"stuffs,\" \"bushed\", \"fudged\", or notably \"double-fudged\" (two-handed blocks), \"facials,\" \"swats,\" \"denials,\" and \"packs.\" Blocked shots were first officially recorded in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] during the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nLargely due to their height and position near the basket, [[center (basketball)|centers]] and [[power forward (basketball)|power forwards]] tend to record the most blocks, but shorter players with good jumping ability can also be blockers, an example being [[Dwyane Wade]], the shortest player, at 6'4\", to record 100 blocked shots in a single season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dish2swish.com/the-legacy-of-dwyane-wade/|title=The Legacy of Dwyane Wade: Is He The Last Elite Shooting Guard?|author=|date=10 July 2016|website=dish2swish.com}}</ref> A player with the ability to block shots can be a positive asset to a team's defense, as they can make it difficult for opposing players to shoot near the basket and by keeping the basketball in play, as opposed to swatting it out of bounds, a blocked shot can lead to a fast break, a skill [[Bill Russell]] was notable for.<ref name=\"Simmons2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Simmons|title=The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zRCU-RakZ0C|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-52010-4|pages=69, 404}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/longform/princeton-georgetown/|publisher=Sports Illustrated|first1=Sean|last1=Gregory|first2=Alexander|last2=Wolff|title=The Game that Saved March Madness|editor=Richard O\u2019Brien|quote=Mourning: \u201cI would tell you this.

The defender is not allowed to make contact with the offensive player's hand (unless the defender is also in contact with the ball) or a ''[[Foul (basketball)|foul]]'' is called. In order to be legal, the block must occur while the shot is traveling upward or at its apex. A deflected field goal that is made does not count as a blocked shot and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team. For the shooter, a blocked shot is counted as a missed field goal attempt. Also, on a shooting foul, a blocked shot cannot be awarded or counted, even if the player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who committed the foul. If the ball is heading downward when the defender hits it, it is ruled as [[goaltending]] and counts as a made basket. Goaltending is also called if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard ([[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] excepted; the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009\u201310 season).\n\nNicknames for blocked shots include \"rejections,\" \"stuffs,\" \"bushed\", \"fudged\", or notably \"double-fudged\" (two-handed blocks), \"facials,\" \"swats,\" \"denials,\" and \"packs.\" Blocked shots were first officially recorded in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] during the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nLargely due to their height and position near the basket, [[center (basketball)|centers]] and [[power forward (basketball)|power forwards]] tend to record the most blocks, but shorter players with good jumping ability can also be blockers, an example being [[Dwyane Wade]], the shortest player, at 6'4\", to record 100 blocked shots in a single season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dish2swish.com/the-legacy-of-dwyane-wade/|title=The Legacy of Dwyane Wade: Is He The Last Elite Shooting Guard?|author=|date=10 July 2016|website=dish2swish.com}}</ref> A player with the ability to block shots can be a positive asset to a team's defense, as they can make it difficult for opposing players to shoot near the basket and by keeping the basketball in play, as opposed to swatting it out of bounds, a blocked shot can lead to a fast break, a skill [[Bill Russell]] was notable for.<ref name=\"Simmons2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Simmons|title=The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zRCU-RakZ0C|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-52010-4|pages=69, 404}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/longform/princeton-georgetown/|publisher=Sports Illustrated|first1=Sean|last1=Gregory|first2=Alexander|last2=Wolff|title=The Game that Saved March Madness|editor=Richard O\u2019Brien|quote=Mourning: \u201cI would tell you this.

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

When a fire occurred, a resident would bang out on the rim, the \u201cbox\u201d number painted on the sign on the rim. Nearby residents were expected to repeat that \u201cbox\u201d number on nearby gongs. 46 gongs were located throughout the township and this method lasted until 1920. \n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\n- Beginning in 1920, residents of the township called the operator and requested the Teaneck Fire Department in order to report incidents. The operator would then transfer the call to the fire department, specifically to the deskman (firefighter assigned to the dispatch desk). The deskman would subsequently ring the necessary firehouse(s) on a switchboard which would activate an air raid siren at the firehouses(s). Responding members would have to pick up the phone (this turned off the air raid siren) also ringing in the station, and the deskman would relay the necessary information (I.e Type of Service, Address, Box Number, Cross streets, etc) which would then be copied to a chalkboard in the station. The lines between all the firehouses were leased from The [[Verizon New York|New York Telephone Company]]\n\n- In 1929, a sort of \u201cprecursor\u201d to the fire departments [[Fire alarm call box|Gamewell Box Alarm]] system was tied into the Fire Department switchboard. This was done by using the 46 police call boxes located around the Township as dual purpose alarm system (police & fire). The Police Call Boxes ran to Police Headquarters via overhead lines so an extension was simply run from Police Headquarters to Fire Headquarters. In order to make the police boxes more visible, red and white rings were painted and each utility pole which had a box mounted to it. These markings are still in use today, with either red & white rings painted or a thick red & white reflective \u201ctape\u201d on the utility poles which have Gamewell Boxes mounted (street boxes). During the year a push was made by the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce to install a better fire alarm system in the township.\n\n- In 1932, the fire department added more street boxes to the police call box system. Also annoyingly, the leased New York Telephone Company phone lines started to give the fire department significant problems. When the deskman would ring firehouses on the switchboard, it would also ring a resident on Penn Avenue home phone. Furthermore, normal calls the resident would receive on any given day, would set off the air raid sirens at Station 2.\n\n- In 1933, an air horn was installed at Fire Headquarters and the air raid siren was removed. The air horn would sound all boxes and signals (type of call) dispatched.\n\n- In 1937, the Gamewell Box Alarm system was introduced in Teaneck. That year, 40 boxes were installed as were bells in all the firehouses.\n\n- In 1940, the air raid sirens stopped being used for fire department purposes and were only sounded for air raid warnings and snow days. The township paid to have phone lines installed between all the firehouses. The Gamewell system was expanded and was then made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in Fire Headquarters. The Fire Departments first voice radios were also implemented and installed in the Chief of Department\u2019s car and Rescue 1. (Radio frequency of 1630KC AM & FCC call sign was KEE888)\n\n- From 1940 through 1957 voice radio was significantly improved. Radios were installed in all the firehouses. Alarms were dispatched in the following sequence: two taps sounded, the box number was sounded on the firehouse bells and air horns as well. Additionally, over the municipal voice lines two announcements were made (Every station had an amplifier & speaker). Lastly, two tones would go out and the dispatch information would be provided over the radio. This was the first iteration of dispatching using the radio for the Teaneck Fire Department.\n\n- In 1948, the fire department switched to 33.8600 Mhz AM but kept the same call sign KEE888. That same year the first Master Boxes were installed in Teaneck. These were Gamewell Boxes which were attached to a building and tied into their interior alarm system. Should a condition set off an interior alarm, the Gamewell Box would also be tripped and the Fire Department would also be notified. All schools in the township were equipped, 1 car dealer, 1 chemical testing facility, 1 bowling alley, 1 night club and 2 [[Taxpayer (building)|taxpayer buildings]] were also equipped.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.backtaps.com/activesystems.htm#Teaneck|title=Active Telegraph Fire Alarm Box Systems|website=www.backtaps.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The tour commander is in charge of the platoon on duty and is usually a Battalion Chief or on occasion the Deputy Chief of Operations (radio [[call sign]]: Car 32). The tour commander reports to the Chief of the Department (radio call sign: Car 30). Each platoon consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 1 Captain, 4 Lieutenants and 15-16 Firefighters.\n\nAt full staffing the riding assignments tend to be the following: Car 32 is manned by the tour commander (Battalion Chief or Deputy Chief of Operations), Ladder 1 rides with 1 Captain or 1 Lieutenant & 5 firefighters. Engines 2, 3 & 4 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 3 Firefighters. The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n== Communications ==\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is dispatched out of Fire Headquarters at 1231 Teaneck Road. The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the Teaneck Police Department & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town. The fire department regularly responds to motor vehicle accidents, with the [[New Jersey State Police]], Bergen County Sheriffs Office and/or Teaneck Police Department and the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps on the aforementioned highways, local thoroughfares and streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>\n\n===== Call History 1929 - 1964 =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=170|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64|y1=208,252,282,380,189,404,424,351,490,499,806,508,710,647,686,664,539,746,722,642,621,843,741,742,706,742,831,780,818,771,868,914,923,911,992,946,951|y2=199,243,274,341,170,387,403,0,0,0,0,414,520,394,471,429,331,0,530,403,416,472,446,492,399,402,440,403,358,410,484,224,448,441,459,444|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n===== Call History 1965 - Present =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=250|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,'00,'01,'02,'03,'04,'05,'06,'07,'08,'09,'10,'11,'12,'13,'14,'15,'16,'17,'18|y1=1044,960,1244,1080,1265,1390,1447,1339,1407,1387,1855,2044,1775,2055,2070,1724,2067,2198,2486,2307,2301,2403,2572,2691,2567,2612,2313,2611,2727,2929,3736,3483,3483,3801,3599,3811,3550,3643,3612,3733,3813,4217,3721,3593,3986,4227,3762,3297,3376,3247,3423,3127,3889,3429|y2=430,480,0,502,245,243,295,321,0,790,586,817,914,744,871,795,662,517,420,526,408,349,308,394,0,313,356,242,260,295,303,353,228,238,254,240,189,195,176,216,266,239,250,0,369,310,256,280,282,319,304,302,215,150,0|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Fires statistic currently unavailable for: 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1946, 1967, 1973, 1989 & 2008\n\n=== Assignments ===\n\nThe Township of Teaneck is geographically split into 4 distinct quadrants (districts); [[New Jersey Route 4|NJ State Route 4]] runs east/west and splits the township to a north-side & south-side, and the [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|CSX River Subdivision Freight Line]] runs north\u2013south and splits the township to an east-side and west-side.

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

When a fire occurred, a resident would bang out on the rim, the \u201cbox\u201d number painted on the sign on the rim. Nearby residents were expected to repeat that \u201cbox\u201d number on nearby gongs. 46 gongs were located throughout the township and this method lasted until 1920. \n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\n- Beginning in 1920, residents of the township called the operator and requested the Teaneck Fire Department in order to report incidents. The operator would then transfer the call to the fire department, specifically to the deskman (firefighter assigned to the dispatch desk). The deskman would subsequently ring the necessary firehouse(s) on a switchboard which would activate an air raid siren at the firehouses(s). Responding members would have to pick up the phone (this turned off the air raid siren) also ringing in the station, and the deskman would relay the necessary information (I.e Type of Service, Address, Box Number, Cross streets, etc) which would then be copied to a chalkboard in the station. The lines between all the firehouses were leased from The [[Verizon New York|New York Telephone Company]]\n\n- In 1929, a sort of \u201cprecursor\u201d to the fire departments [[Fire alarm call box|Gamewell Box Alarm]] system was tied into the Fire Department switchboard. This was done by using the 46 police call boxes located around the Township as dual purpose alarm system (police & fire). The Police Call Boxes ran to Police Headquarters via overhead lines so an extension was simply run from Police Headquarters to Fire Headquarters. In order to make the police boxes more visible, red and white rings were painted and each utility pole which had a box mounted to it. These markings are still in use today, with either red & white rings painted or a thick red & white reflective \u201ctape\u201d on the utility poles which have Gamewell Boxes mounted (street boxes). During the year a push was made by the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce to install a better fire alarm system in the township.\n\n- In 1932, the fire department added more street boxes to the police call box system. Also annoyingly, the leased New York Telephone Company phone lines started to give the fire department significant problems. When the deskman would ring firehouses on the switchboard, it would also ring a resident on Penn Avenue home phone. Furthermore, normal calls the resident would receive on any given day, would set off the air raid sirens at Station 2.\n\n- In 1933, an air horn was installed at Fire Headquarters and the air raid siren was removed. The air horn would sound all boxes and signals (type of call) dispatched.\n\n- In 1937, the Gamewell Box Alarm system was introduced in Teaneck. That year, 40 boxes were installed as were bells in all the firehouses.\n\n- In 1940, the air raid sirens stopped being used for fire department purposes and were only sounded for air raid warnings and snow days. The township paid to have phone lines installed between all the firehouses. The Gamewell system was expanded and was then made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in Fire Headquarters. The Fire Departments first voice radios were also implemented and installed in the Chief of Department\u2019s car and Rescue 1. (Radio frequency of 1630KC AM & FCC call sign was KEE888)\n\n- From 1940 through 1957 voice radio was significantly improved. Radios were installed in all the firehouses. Alarms were dispatched in the following sequence: two taps sounded, the box number was sounded on the firehouse bells and air horns as well. Additionally, over the municipal voice lines two announcements were made (Every station had an amplifier & speaker). Lastly, two tones would go out and the dispatch information would be provided over the radio. This was the first iteration of dispatching using the radio for the Teaneck Fire Department.\n\n- In 1948, the fire department switched to 33.8600 Mhz AM but kept the same call sign KEE888. That same year the first Master Boxes were installed in Teaneck. These were Gamewell Boxes which were attached to a building and tied into their interior alarm system. Should a condition set off an interior alarm, the Gamewell Box would also be tripped and the Fire Department would also be notified. All schools in the township were equipped, 1 car dealer, 1 chemical testing facility, 1 bowling alley, 1 night club and 2 [[Taxpayer (building)|taxpayer buildings]] were also equipped. \u00a0\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The tour commander is in charge of the platoon on duty and is usually a Battalion Chief or on occasion the Deputy Chief of Operations (radio [[call sign]]: Car 32). The tour commander reports to the Chief of the Department (radio call sign: Car 30). Each platoon consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 1 Captain, 4 Lieutenants and 15-16 Firefighters.\n\nAt full staffing the riding assignments tend to be the following: Car 32 is manned by the tour commander (Battalion Chief or Deputy Chief of Operations), Ladder 1 rides with 1 Captain or 1 Lieutenant & 5 firefighters. Engines 2, 3 & 4 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 3 Firefighters. The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n== Communications ==\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is dispatched out of Fire Headquarters at 1231 Teaneck Road. The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the Teaneck Police Department & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town. The fire department regularly responds to motor vehicle accidents, with the [[New Jersey State Police]], Bergen County Sheriffs Office and/or Teaneck Police Department and the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps on the aforementioned highways, local thoroughfares and streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>\n\n===== Call History 1929 - 1964 =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=170|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64|y1=208,252,282,380,189,404,424,351,490,499,806,508,710,647,686,664,539,746,722,642,621,843,741,742,706,742,831,780,818,771,868,914,923,911,992,946,951|y2=199,243,274,341,170,387,403,0,0,0,0,414,520,394,471,429,331,0,530,403,416,472,446,492,399,402,440,403,358,410,484,224,448,441,459,444|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n===== Call History 1965 - Present =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=250|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,'00,'01,'02,'03,'04,'05,'06,'07,'08,'09,'10,'11,'12,'13,'14,'15,'16,'17,'18|y1=1044,960,1244,1080,1265,1390,1447,1339,1407,1387,1855,2044,1775,2055,2070,1724,2067,2198,2486,2307,2301,2403,2572,2691,2567,2612,2313,2611,2727,2929,3736,3483,3483,3801,3599,3811,3550,3643,3612,3733,3813,4217,3721,3593,3986,4227,3762,3297,3376,3247,3423,3127,3889,3429|y2=430,480,0,502,245,243,295,321,0,790,586,817,914,744,871,795,662,517,420,526,408,349,308,394,0,313,356,242,260,295,303,353,228,238,254,240,189,195,176,216,266,239,250,0,369,310,256,280,282,319,304,302,215,150,0|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Fires statistic currently unavailable for: 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1946, 1967, 1973, 1989 & 2008\n\n=== Assignments ===\n\nThe Township of Teaneck is geographically split into 4 distinct quadrants (districts); [[New Jersey Route 4|NJ State Route 4]] runs east/west and splits the township to a north-side & south-side, and the [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|CSX River Subdivision Freight Line]] runs north\u2013south and splits the township to an east-side and west-side.

This is a departure from Dakin's usual modus operandi and the job is further complicated by his having to work with fellow gangster Frank Fletcher's firm.\n\nThe film's intricate sub-plots explore Dakin's sadistic nature, his relationship with small time associate Wolfie and his irritation at having to work with Frank Fletcher's seemingly weak brother-in-law Ed Lowis. Other parts of the story follow Wolfie's bisexual liaisons with Venetia and Dakin, the blackmail of MP Gerald Draycott to provide a cast-iron alibi for Dakin and the dogged detectives Bob Matthews and Tom Binney pursuing Dakin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Vic Dakin\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Wolfe Lissner\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as Bob Matthews\n* [[Donald Sinden]] as Gerald Draycott\n* [[Fiona Lewis]] as Venetia\n* [[T.

It is based on [[James Barlow (author)|James Barlow]]'s 1968 novel ''The Burden of Proof''. This was first feature for the director, [[Michael Tuchner]], who had only worked in television.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nIn a growing trend for movies of the same era and genre (''[[Get Carter]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' for example) some of the violence is quite graphic especially during the heist and foreshadows several 1970s cop TV shows such as ''[[The Sweeney]]'', ''[[Target (UK TV series)|Target]]'' and ''[[Special Branch (TV series)|Special Branch]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nRuthless [[East End of London|East End]] gangster Vic Dakin has plans for an ambitious raid on the wages van of a plastics factory. This is a departure from Dakin's usual modus operandi and the job is further complicated by his having to work with fellow gangster Frank Fletcher's firm.\n\nThe film's intricate sub-plots explore Dakin's sadistic nature, his relationship with small time associate Wolfie and his irritation at having to work with Frank Fletcher's seemingly weak brother-in-law Ed Lowis. Other parts of the story follow Wolfie's bisexual liaisons with Venetia and Dakin, the blackmail of MP Gerald Draycott to provide a cast-iron alibi for Dakin and the dogged detectives Bob Matthews and Tom Binney pursuing Dakin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Vic Dakin\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Wolfe Lissner\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as Bob Matthews\n* [[Donald Sinden]] as Gerald Draycott\n* [[Fiona Lewis]] as Venetia\n* [[T.

He credited his tuba experience for giving him the \"feel\" to pick up string bass quickly without any prior experience.<ref>{{cite podcast\n| url=https://www.wusf.usf.edu/podcasts/archive/classical-jazz\n| title=Jazz Highlights - John Lamb\n| website=Classical & Jazz Highlights\n| publisher=[[WUSF (FM)|WUSF Public Media]]\n| date=19 September 2018\n| time=\n| access-date=29 September 2018\n}}</ref>\n\nLamb joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1964, and toured with them for three years.<ref name='Area'>{{cite web|title=Area Artists - John Lamb|url=http://www.articulatesuncoast.com/blogs/music/10-music/291-area-artists-john-lamb|publisher=All About Jazz|author=David Manson|accessdate=4 July 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705033604/http://www.articulatesuncoast.com/blogs/music/10-music/291-area-artists-john-lamb|archive-date=5 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lamb was more of a fan of [[Miles Davis]] and [[Red Garland]] when he was with Ellington, later saying, \u201cI was very young and very cocky. I thought I knew more than Duke at that time...I have more time today to reflect on the things that were accomplished back then, and the places we traveled to and all the wonderful people that we met.
