The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.  Mize thus became the first Augusta native to win the Masters. <ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/si_history_stories/1987.html |title=My, Oh Mize |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Ballard |first=Sarah |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403102648/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/si_history_stories/1987.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008}}</ref> In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63 and had a six-stroke lead over [[Nick Faldo]] entering the final round.

Norman finished in the top five at the Masters eight times but never won.\n\nTwo-time champion [[Ben Crenshaw]] captured an emotional Masters win in 1995, just days after the death of his lifelong teacher and mentor [[Harvey Penick]].   After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal.

Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.<ref name=\"olson\"/>\n\nThe Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |title=The Olson File |publisher=Frankolsonproject.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010804055955/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |archivedate=2001-08-04 |df= }}</ref> A few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research.

Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\nPreviously, the CIA and the army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine\u2014known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''\u2014that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted \"incident to service.\"\n\nIn 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5\u20134 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.<ref>''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}</ref> The majority argued that \"a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.\" In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:\n\n<blockquote>The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects.... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.</blockquote>\n\nJustice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:\n\n<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>\n\nIn another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |title=Ritchie v.

Since its effects were temporary, he believed one could give it to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in \"normal\" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives.

The committee noted that the \"experiments sponsored by these researchers ... call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.\"\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Church Committee, President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited \"experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject\" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission.

Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.<ref name=\"olson\"/>\n\nThe Olson family disputes the official version of events.

Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\nPreviously, the CIA and the army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine\u2014known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''\u2014that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted \"incident to service.\"\n\nIn 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5\u20134 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.<ref>''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}</ref> The majority argued that \"a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.\" In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:\n\n<blockquote>The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects.... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.</blockquote>\n\nJustice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:\n\n<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>\n\nIn another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |title=Ritchie v.

{"title_page": "Katie Redford", "text_new": "'''Katharine \"Katie\" Redford''' (born March 7, 1978) is an American human rights lawyer and activist who is credited with spearheading a movement to hold international companies accountable for overseas abuse in their home court jurisdictions in the Western world, and in doing so, opened up new possibilities in [[#Human Rights Law|human rights law]]. Along with her husband, Burmese human rights activist [[Ka Hsaw Wa]], she is the co-founder and US Office Director of [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International] (ERI), a non-profit group of activists, organizers, and lawyers with expertise in human rights, the environment, and corporate/government accountability.\n\nRedford is a graduate of the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] (UVA), where she received the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights and Public Service. She is a member of the Massachusetts State Bar and served as counsel to plaintiffs in ERI's landmark case [[Doe v. Unocal]]. Redford received an [[Echoing Green]] Fellowship<ref name=\"Echoing Green\">Echoing Green website, 2005 Fellows (http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/katherine-redford {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019125825/http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/katherine-redford |date=2008-10-19 }})</ref> in 1995 to establish ERI, and since that time has split her time between ERI's [[Thailand]] and US offices. In addition to working on ERI's litigation and teaching at the EarthRights Schools, Redford currently serves as an adjunct professor of law at both UVA<ref>University of Virginia website, Human Rights Program (http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2003_fall/humanrightsprogram.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030950/http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2003_fall/humanrightsprogram.htm |date=2016-03-04 }})</ref> and the [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]].<ref>Washing College of Law website, Faculty (http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/redford/)</ref> She has published on various issues associated with human rights and corporate accountability, in addition to co-authoring ERI reports such as ''In Our Court'', ''Shock and Law'', and ''Total Denial Continues''. In 2006, Redford was selected as an [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Global Fellow]].<ref>Ashoka Website, 2006 Fellows (http://ashoka.org/node/3710)</ref>\n\n==Human Rights Law==\nRedford introduced a simple and powerful idea into the human rights movement: that corporations can be brought to court for their role in overseas abuse. While American and European courts have customarily declined to hear cases where abuses have occurred outside their jurisdiction, Redford and her team at [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International] (ERI) broke their reluctance by uncovering legal tools and strategies that overcome the barrier of jurisdiction.\n\nIn 1994 Redford turned in a law school paper suggesting the use of an ancient federal statute to fight human rights abuses in [[Burma]], The [[Alien Torts Statute|Alien Torts Claims Act]]. The act dates back to 1789, when [[George Washington]] signed the fledgling nation's first [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]]. An obscure provision in it appears to give foreigners the right to sue in federal court over violations of international law. Though the act has been used to sue individuals, it has never been used successfully to sue a corporation for human rights abuses.  Her professor gave her an A but warned that such a case would never occur. That student paper, ''\"Using the Alien Torts Claims Act: [[Unocal]] v. [[Burma]],\"'' became the basis of the groundbreaking case John Doe I, et al. v. Unocal Corp., et al.  In March 1997 it became the first case in which jurisdiction was granted over a corporation for human rights abuses overseas.   [[Unocal]] eventually settled the case out of court.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\">Bloomberg News, December 14, 2004, \"Unocal Settles Rights Suit in Myanmar\" (https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/business/14unocal.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=unocal+settles+burma&st=nyt&oref=slogin&oref=slogin)</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Redford received seed money from Echoing Green<ref name=\"Echoing Green\"/> to launch [http://www.earthrights.org/ EarthRights International] (ERI) with Tyler Giannini and [[Ka Hsaw Wa]]. ERI began its work with offices in [[Thailand]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], as a nonprofit organization that works at the intersection of human rights and the environment\u2014which it defines as \"earth rights\"\u2014by documenting abuses, mounting legal actions against the perpetrators of earth rights abuses, providing training for grassroots and community leaders, and launching advocacy campaigns.\n\nERI brought the case of John Doe I, et al. v. Unocal Corp., et al., to both state and federal courts in [[California]]. Most legal experts believed the case would never fly and at first it appeared they may be right. But seeing possibilities where the experts could not, Redford persevered throughout the protracted, ten-year-long legal battle. ERI had their case dismissed in 2000, fought back and won by appeal,<ref name=\"nytimes\">New York Times, September 19, 2002, \"Court Tells Unocal to Face Rights Charges\" (https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5D91330F93AA2575AC0A9649C8B63&scp=2&sq=unocal+human+rights&st=nyt)</ref><ref>Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Richard A.

Redford trudged forward, putting in countless hours of legal work, fundraising and research, and building coalitions with likeminded organizations such as [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]. After several years of fighting an uphill battle without losing hope, the rewards finally came, in 2004. [[Unocal]] agreed to settle the lawsuit.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/><ref>Environment News Service, December 17, 2004 \"Unocal Settles Out of Court With Myanmar Villagers\" (http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/dec2004/2004-12-17-02.asp)</ref> It was the first time in history that a major multinational corporation had settled a case of this type for monetary damages.\n\nIn the landmark settlement, the company agreed to compensate the Burmese villagers who sued the firm for complicity in forced labor, rape, and murder. By combining human rights law and environmental law, ERI had come up with a new and untested strategy that succeeded where older solutions had failed.  Their story was documented in the 2006 documentary film ''[[Total Denial]]''.\n\nEqually importantly, the [[Unocal]] case set a strong legal precedent. As a result of ERI's efforts, a series of rulings in the California Federal Court<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> established that a corporation can indeed be held liable in U.S. courts for encouraging human rights violations by a foreign government. This put corporations on notice and forced them to consider their actions abroad.\nUnocal attempted to recover the damages from its insurer.<ref>EarthRights International website, Legal Feature (http://www.earthrights.org/legalfeature/us_court_calls_abuses_committed_in_construction_of_chevrons_pipeline_military_terrorism.html)</ref> The insurer did not pay, but instead reviewed its policies to ensure that it would not be liable to cover damages for murder, rape, and torture. Then banks began reviewing their liability for funding the projects. Thus, liability for abuse becomes an important business issue, not merely the preoccupation of a few activists.\n\nToday Redford and her team at ERI use the [[Unocal]] case as a model to fight corporate misbehavior. Working in partnership with other legal organizations and private lawyers, they seeks to remedy abuses of earth rights\u2014all over the world. For instance, Redford and ERI are currently working with the victims of human rights abuses associated with the activities of the oil company [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in [[Nigeria]] to fight the [[Bowoto v. Chevron Corp.|case]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in federal court in [[San Francisco]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on March 7, 1968, she was raised in [[Wellesley, MA]] and in 1986 she graduated from [[Wellesley High School]].  Redford attended [[Colgate University]]<ref>The Colgate Scene, November 1996 Issue \"Colgate's Earthrights Crusader\" (http://www4.colgate.edu/scene/nov1996/redford.html)</ref> in rural upstate New York where she was a member of the swimming and diving teams.  She found spending six hours a day in the water too much and later quit and began playing rugby, a Division I sport at Colgate.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1990, Redford signed on with the [[WorldTeach]] program and found herself teaching English in a village on the Thai-Burmese border.\n\nOn her summer break she visited a Thai refugee camp and lived with a family who had fled the Burmese military dictatorship. There she taught English in a bamboo hut. Along the border, bombs would explode from battles between the military and its opposition. Every day brought new streams of refugees, with tales of rape, torture, killing, and forced labor.\n\nShe headed home and in the fall of 1992, Redford enrolled at the [[University of Virginia Law School]] to study human rights and environmental law but as soon as school was out for the summer, she left again for Thailand.  This time she went as an intern for [[Human Rights Watch]], documenting abuses associated with forced labor. She returned to the same refugee camp to live with the same Burmese family she had stayed with the summer before. The father, a pro-democracy activist, arranged to sneak her into [[Burma]]. (The military, which staged a coup in 1988, officially changed the country's name to [[Myanmar]] the following year.)\n\nThat year Redford met [[Ka Hsaw Wa]], a [[Karen people|Karen]] student activist who had fled to the jungle and was collecting villagers' tales of abuse under the junta.  She spent three weeks with him and a small group paddling up the [[Salween River]], stopping at villages near the front lines of fighting between the military and the opposition and gathering villagers' stories.\n\nThe summer after their second year, she and two classmates got a fellowship to look at the [[World Bank]]'s presence in [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]]. But Ka Hsaw Wa told them the real story was the [[Yadana Pipeline]], being built by French company [[Total S.A.]] and [[Unocal]], which is headquartered in [[El Segundo, CA]]. The 39-mile natural gas line cuts through the Burmese jungle to the Thai border.\n\nHer third year, she did an independent research project on the [[Alien Torts Claims Act]] and Unocal's role in the Burmese pipeline, the paper that earned her an A. She also wrote a grant proposal to start [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International], a nonprofit human rights organization. The day after she took the bar examination, in 1995, she returned to [[Thailand]] to live and run the newly formed group with Ka Hsaw Wa and a fellow law school graduate.\n\nIn November 1996, Redford and [[Ka Hsaw Wa]] were married in a Thai village; they honeymooned in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]].

Along with her husband, Burmese human rights activist [[Ka Hsaw Wa]], she is the co-founder and US Office Director of [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International] (ERI), a non-profit group of activists, organizers, and lawyers with expertise in human rights, the environment, and corporate/government accountability.\n\nRedford is a graduate of the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] (UVA), where she received the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights and Public Service. She is a member of the Massachusetts State Bar and served as counsel to plaintiffs in ERI's landmark case [[Doe v. Unocal]].

While American and European courts have customarily declined to hear cases where abuses have occurred outside their jurisdiction, Redford and her team at [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International] (ERI) broke their reluctance by uncovering legal tools and strategies that overcome the barrier of jurisdiction.\n\nIn 1994 Redford turned in a law school paper suggesting the use of an ancient federal statute to fight human rights abuses in [[Burma]], The [[Alien Torts Statute|Alien Torts Claims Act]]. The act dates back to 1789, when [[George Washington]] signed the fledgling nation's first [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]]. An obscure provision in it appears to give foreigners the right to sue in federal court over violations of international law. Though the act has been used to sue individuals, it has never been used successfully to sue a corporation for human rights abuses.  Her professor gave her an A but warned that such a case would never occur. That student paper, ''\"Using the Alien Torts Claims Act: [[Unocal]] v. [[Burma]],\"'' became the basis of the groundbreaking case John Doe I, et al. v. Unocal Corp., et al.  In March 1997 it became the first case in which jurisdiction was granted over a corporation for human rights abuses overseas.   [[Unocal]] eventually settled the case out of court.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\">Bloomberg News, December 14, 2004, \"Unocal Settles Rights Suit in Myanmar\" (https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/business/14unocal.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=unocal+settles+burma&st=nyt&oref=slogin&oref=slogin)</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Redford received seed money from Echoing Green<ref name=\"Echoing Green\"/> to launch [http://www.earthrights.org/ EarthRights International] (ERI) with Tyler Giannini and [[Ka Hsaw Wa]]. ERI began its work with offices in [[Thailand]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], as a nonprofit organization that works at the intersection of human rights and the environment\u2014which it defines as \"earth rights\"\u2014by documenting abuses, mounting legal actions against the perpetrators of earth rights abuses, providing training for grassroots and community leaders, and launching advocacy campaigns.\n\nERI brought the case of John Doe I, et al. v. Unocal Corp., et al., to both state and federal courts in [[California]]. Most legal experts believed the case would never fly and at first it appeared they may be right. But seeing possibilities where the experts could not, Redford persevered throughout the protracted, ten-year-long legal battle. ERI had their case dismissed in 2000, fought back and won by appeal,<ref name=\"nytimes\">New York Times, September 19, 2002, \"Court Tells Unocal to Face Rights Charges\" (https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5D91330F93AA2575AC0A9649C8B63&scp=2&sq=unocal+human+rights&st=nyt)</ref><ref>Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Richard A.

Redford trudged forward, putting in countless hours of legal work, fundraising and research, and building coalitions with likeminded organizations such as [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]. After several years of fighting an uphill battle without losing hope, the rewards finally came, in 2004. [[Unocal]] agreed to settle the lawsuit.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/><ref>Environment News Service, December 17, 2004 \"Unocal Settles Out of Court With Myanmar Villagers\" (http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/dec2004/2004-12-17-02.asp)</ref> It was the first time in history that a major multinational corporation had settled a case of this type for monetary damages.\n\nIn the landmark settlement, the company agreed to compensate the Burmese villagers who sued the firm for complicity in forced labor, rape, and murder. By combining human rights law and environmental law, ERI had come up with a new and untested strategy that succeeded where older solutions had failed.  Their story was documented in the 2006 documentary film ''[[Total Denial]]''.\n\nEqually importantly, the [[Unocal]] case set a strong legal precedent. As a result of ERI's efforts, a series of rulings in the California Federal Court<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> established that a corporation can indeed be held liable in U.S. courts for encouraging human rights violations by a foreign government. This put corporations on notice and forced them to consider their actions abroad.\nUnocal attempted to recover the damages from its insurer.<ref>EarthRights International website, Legal Feature (http://www.earthrights.org/legalfeature/us_court_calls_abuses_committed_in_construction_of_chevrons_pipeline_military_terrorism.html)</ref> The insurer did not pay, but instead reviewed its policies to ensure that it would not be liable to cover damages for murder, rape, and torture. Then banks began reviewing their liability for funding the projects. Thus, liability for abuse becomes an important business issue, not merely the preoccupation of a few activists.\n\nToday Redford and her team at ERI use the [[Unocal]] case as a model to fight corporate misbehavior. Working in partnership with other legal organizations and private lawyers, they seeks to remedy abuses of earth rights\u2014all over the world. For instance, Redford and ERI are currently working with the victims of human rights abuses associated with the activities of the oil company [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in [[Nigeria]] to fight the [[Bowoto v. Chevron Corp.|case]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in federal court in [[San Francisco]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on March 7, 1968, she was raised in [[Wellesley, MA]] and in 1986 she graduated from [[Wellesley High School]].  Redford attended [[Colgate University]]<ref>The Colgate Scene, November 1996 Issue \"Colgate's Earthrights Crusader\" (http://www4.colgate.edu/scene/nov1996/redford.html)</ref> in rural upstate New York where she was a member of the swimming and diving teams.  She found spending six hours a day in the water too much and later quit and began playing rugby, a Division I sport at Colgate.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1990, Redford signed on with the [[WorldTeach]] program and found herself teaching English in a village on the Thai-Burmese border.\n\nOn her summer break she visited a Thai refugee camp and lived with a family who had fled the Burmese military dictatorship. There she taught English in a bamboo hut. Along the border, bombs would explode from battles between the military and its opposition. Every day brought new streams of refugees, with tales of rape, torture, killing, and forced labor.\n\nShe headed home and in the fall of 1992, Redford enrolled at the [[University of Virginia Law School]] to study human rights and environmental law but as soon as school was out for the summer, she left again for Thailand.  This time she went as an intern for [[Human Rights Watch]], documenting abuses associated with forced labor. She returned to the same refugee camp to live with the same Burmese family she had stayed with the summer before. The father, a pro-democracy activist, arranged to sneak her into [[Burma]]. (The military, which staged a coup in 1988, officially changed the country's name to [[Myanmar]] the following year.)\n\nThat year Redford met [[Ka Hsaw Wa]], a [[Karen people|Karen]] student activist who had fled to the jungle and was collecting villagers' tales of abuse under the junta.  She spent three weeks with him and a small group paddling up the [[Salween River]], stopping at villages near the front lines of fighting between the military and the opposition and gathering villagers' stories.\n\nThe summer after their second year, she and two classmates got a fellowship to look at the [[World Bank]]'s presence in [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]]. But Ka Hsaw Wa told them the real story was the [[Yadana Pipeline]], being built by French company [[Total S.A.]] and [[Unocal]], which is headquartered in [[El Segundo, CA]]. The 39-mile natural gas line cuts through the Burmese jungle to the Thai border.\n\nHer third year, she did an independent research project on the [[Alien Torts Claims Act]] and Unocal's role in the Burmese pipeline, the paper that earned her an A. She also wrote a grant proposal to start [http://www.earthrights.org EarthRights International], a nonprofit human rights organization. The day after she took the bar examination, in 1995, she returned to [[Thailand]] to live and run the newly formed group with Ka Hsaw Wa and a fellow law school graduate.\n\nIn November 1996, Redford and [[Ka Hsaw Wa]] were married in a Thai village; they honeymooned in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]]. The following October, she filed [[Doe v. Unocal]], and in March 1997 it became the first case in which jurisdiction was granted over a corporation for human rights abuses overseas. This case was documented in the 2006 film ''[[Total Denial]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.earthrights.org/ EarthRights International]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090715024320/http://www.earthrights.org/site_blurbs/doe_v._unocal_case_history.html \"Doe v.

The work was not heard in a complete public performance, however, until some years after it was completed.

Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as [[Igor Stravinsky]]<ref>Short, p. 131</ref> and [[Arnold Schoenberg]],<ref name=HolstLM/> as well as such late Russian romantics as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]].

Critic [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] offers an alternative explanation for the piece's structure: that Jupiter is the centrepoint of the suite and that the movements on either side are in mirror images. Thus Mars involves motion and Neptune is static; Venus is sublime while Uranus is vulgar, and Mercury is light and ''[[scherzando]]'' while Saturn is heavy and plodding.

Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as [[Igor Stravinsky]]<ref>Short, p. 131</ref> and [[Arnold Schoenberg]],<ref name=HolstLM/> as well as such late Russian romantics as [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]. Its novel sonorities helped make the work an immediate success with audiences at home and abroad. Although ''The Planets'' remains Holst's most popular work, the composer himself did not count it among his best creations and later in life complained that its popularity had completely surpassed his other works.

Critic [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] offers an alternative explanation for the piece's structure: that Jupiter is the centrepoint of the suite and that the movements on either side are in mirror images. Thus Mars involves motion and Neptune is static; Venus is sublime while Uranus is vulgar, and Mercury is light and ''[[scherzando]]'' while Saturn is heavy and plodding.
