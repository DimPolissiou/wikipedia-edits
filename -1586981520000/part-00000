Depending on the court, a [[plaintiff]] would purchase a [[writ]] in [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] (or file a bill) which would set in motion a series of events eventually leading to a trial in one of the medieval common law courts. Each writ entailed a different set of procedures and remedies which together amounted to the \"form of action\".\n\nThe forms of action were abolished during the 19th century, but they have left an indelible mark on the law. In the early [[Middle Ages]], the focus was on the procedure that was employed to bring one's claim to the royal courts of [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] or [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]]: it was the ''form'' of one's action, not its substance, which occupied legal discussion. This restrictive approach is one of the reasons which attracted litigants to petition the King directly, which eventually led to the development of a separate court known as the [[Court of Chancery]], from which the body of law known as [[Equity (law)|equity]] derives. Modern [[English law]], as in most other legal systems, now looks to substance rather than to form: a claimant need only demonstrate that he or she has a valid [[cause of action]].\n\n==Forms of action==\nThe substantive law lay buried beneath the various actions: medieval practitioners and judges thought procedurally, not substantively.<ref>See generally [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed); [[S. F. C. Milsom]], ''Historical Foundations of the Common'' Law (2nd ed).</ref> Rights and duties which we would consider to be part of the law of [[English property law|property]], [[English tort law|tort]], [[English contract law|contract]] or [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]] were not conceptualised as such.\n\nIn the early medieval period, justice was administered at a local level. Following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in the 11th century, a system of royal central justice gradually took shape. The principal royal courts were King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer. These royal courts were initially only interested in matters relating to the feudal system: that is, to land law. Accordingly, many of the earliest writs dealt with real property. For example:\n* Writ of right\n* [[assize of novel disseisin]]\n* [[assize of mort d'ancestor]]\n* Writ of entry sur [[disseisin]] in the per and cui\n* Writ of besaiel\n* Writ of [[quare impedit]]\n* [[Ejectment]]\n\nOver time, the royal courts began to take notice of other cases. These early writs were in the ''praecipe'' form: they commanded that the defendant perform a certain act or else appear and explain why he had not done so. Examples include the writs of covenant, debt and account. Such writs ''demanded something as of right''.<ref>See [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed)</ref> The royal courts were initially only concerned with ''complaints of wrong'' if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King's Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a writ of trespass ''vi et armis contra pacem regis''. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King's Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his 'special case' in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This was known as a [[trespass on the case]]. From the trespass on the case developed many other forms of action. Apart from the actions which dealt with real property, other significant forms of action include:\n* Action of covenant\n* Action of debt ''sur obligation'' (\"Debt on an obligation\")\n* Action of debt ''sur contract'' (\"Debt on a contract\")\n* Action of [[detinue]]\n* Action of account\n* Trespass ''vi et armis contra pacem regis'' (\"Trespass with force and arms against the King's peace\")\n* Trespass ''sur la case'' (\"Trespass on the case\" or \"action on the case\")\n** Conversion\n** Nuisance\n** Negligence\n** Deceit\n** Action on the case for words (Defamation, Slander) \n** [[Assumpsit]]\n*** Special assumpsit\n*** Indebitatus assumpsit \n**** [[Money had and received|Action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]]\n**** Action for money paid to the defendant's use\n**** [[Quantum meruit]]\n**** Quantum valebant\n\nMany actions developed from the action on the case during the later history of the common law. The three most significant of these were:<ref>See generally, Sir John Baker, ''An Introduction to Legal History'' (4th ed); David Ibbetson, ''Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations'' (2nd ed).</ref> \n* ''The action of assumpsit'', the rapid expansion of which is traced to ''[[Slade's Case]]'' (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of contracts under seal, for which debt ''sur obligation'' was required), a shift vindicated in ''Slade's Case''. The modern [[English contract law|law of contract]] then gradually began to take shape.\n* ''The action of indebitatus assumpsit''. Following the recognition in ''Slade's Case'' (1602) that assumpsit could be brought in lieu of debt ''sur contract'', a form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit took shape. This action developed several sub-forms known as the common money counts. These actions were initially used to enforce what we would call contractual liability, but they rested on the court implying that a defendant had promised to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff. This promise initially reflected reality, but came to be used fictitiously. Thus where A mistakenly paid money to B, the law would imply a promise by B that B would repay the money: A could then bring an action for money had and received and recover the mistaken payment. The defendant's obligation was not consensually undertaken, but imposed by law. From such actions came the [[Quasi-contract|law of quasi-contract]].  This area of law is now known as the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. \n* ''The action on the case for negligence'', the rapid expansion of which is traced to [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] [1932]. The tort of negligence lies at the heart of the modern [[English tort law|law of tort]], which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of trespass (to the person, to goods, and to land), actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation.\n\n==England==\nOne of the reasons for the crystallisation of particular forms of action in English common law is the fact that actions in the royal courts were commenced by use of a writ purchased in Chancery. Initially, the clerks of the Chancery were permitted to devise new writs to deal with new situations. This freedom was drastically curtailed by the [[Provisions of Oxford]].\n\nBy the 14th century the common law had begun to show some of its defects. First, different forms of action would result in different procedures, hence one's chance of success could depend critically on the form of action which was used. The forms were mandatory: if the wrong form were used, a case could fail. Secondly, the common law had strict rules of evidence. For example, a deed was conclusive proof of a defendant's liability to pay. If a plaintiff brought a writ of debt ''sur obligation'' against the defendant, but the defendant had already paid the debt, the defendant would still be held liable to pay unless he could produce a deed of acquittance. Problems such as these prompted litigants to turn to the [[Equity (law)|Court of Chancery]], which had begun to develop judicial functions in the early 14th century.\n\n===Abolition of the forms===\n\nBecause the forms of action remained largely static from the 13th century, English lawyers and judges formulated a number of [[legal fiction]]s in order to fit new types of cases within the existing forms.\n\nFor example, in a writ of debt ''sur contract'', the defendant could generally elect between having a jury trial or [[wager of law]]. The latter was a particularly undesired option for a plaintiff because the defendant could ''hire'' oath-helpers. This and other restrictions (for example, that the sum the plaintiff sued for had to be a fixed rather than an [[Liquidated damages|unliquidated]] sum) made debt ''sur contract'' undesirable for enforcing oral contracts. In the 16th century, litigants began to bring an action on the case instead: an action of assumpsit. The plaintiff would allege that, because the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had undertook (''assumpsit'') to pay the money. The Court of King's Bench gradually accepted that the subsequent promise did not need not be proven: the defendant's alleged promise to pay the antecedent debt would be supplied by law. This view was vindicated in ''[[Slade's Case]]'' (1602).\n\nThe forms themselves remained unchallenged. The Court of Chancery eventually ceased to be the answer to the restrictive approach at common law. By the 16th century the intervention of the Chancellor was increasingly said to depend on principles, rather than on some unbounded discretion. Chancery developed a stronger system of precedent and, in the words of [[John Baker (legal historian)|Professor Sir John Baker]], \"hardened into law\".<ref>See [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed)</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed several laws to simplify legal procedure, and the old forms of action were gradually swept away:\n* For personal forms of action, the ''Uniformity of Process Act 1832'' (2 Will. IV, c.39) imposed a single uniform process. The older forms of writ were abolished and a new form of writ was to be used, although the writ had to state the form of action that was being used.\n* The next year, most real and mixed actions were abolished, by the ''Real Property Limitation Act 1833'' (3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 27, sec 36).\n* There then followed the ''Common Law Procedure Act 1852'' (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76), which dropped the requirement that any particular form of action should be mentioned within a writ. \n* Finally, with the passage of the [[Judicature Act 1873]], the last vestiges of the forms of action were removed. The flexible bill procedure of Chancery was adopted by the common law courts. It was now only necessary to state the facts sufficient to give rise to one's [[cause of action]].\n\n=== The substantive law ===\nWith the abolition of the forms of action, it became necessary (and for the first time truly possible) to perceive the substantive law beneath the various actions. In terms of the private law of obligations, the following points can be noted.\n* ''Contract.'' The various writs by which agreements could be enforced became part of a modern [[English contract law|law of contract]], explicable in terms of consensually assumed obligation. But traces of the old forms of action remain. For example, it is not necessary to show that a claimant has provided consideration where she sues on a deed. This is because consideration was never a requirement in the action of debt ''sur obligation''.\n* ''Tort.'' The various writs which involved complaint of a civil wrong and a demand for a remedy came together in a [[English tort law|law of tort]]. \n* ''Unjust enrichment.'' At first, common law restitutionary obligations were appended to the law of contract and said to form a law of [[quasi-contract]]. Motivated by the writing of scholars from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] the courts gradually accepted that such obligations were of another kind, underpinned by the concept of [[unjust enrichment]].<ref>See generally, Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, ''The Law of Restitution'' (1st ed, 1966); Peter Birks, ''An Introduction to the Law of Restitution'' (1985); Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Andrew Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011).</ref> In ''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]'' [1991] the House of Lords explicitly recognised the independent existence of the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]].\n\n==South Australia==\n\nThe ''Common Law Procedure Act 1852'' (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76) was enacted prior to the promulgation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and while it was repealed in England, continued to apply by paramount force in South Australia.\nThe Supreme Court Act 1935<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/sca1935183/ | title=Supreme Court Act 1935 (South Australia) | publisher=Austlii | accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> grants to the Supreme Court of South Australia the like jurisdiction exercised by both the common law and equity courts of England prior to the enactment of the Judiciary Acts which included the initiation of a personal jurisdiction over a person in a case by virtue of the issue of a writ of summons. The judges of the Court were given power to regulate the procedure of the Court within jurisdiction and preserved the Rules of Court extant at 1935 in cases not otherwise provided for. The writ of summons is the common originating process, but takes a form approved under the present rules.\n\n==United States==\n\nThe forms of action survived much longer in the United States.  New York was the first to abolish them, by enacting a Code of Civil Procedure in 1850 at the suggestion of [[David Dudley Field II]].  Twenty-three other states eventually followed.  Section 307 of the [[California Code of Civil Procedure]] is a typical example of how the forms of action were abolished in those states: \"There is in this State but one form of civil actions for the enforcement or protection of private rights and the redress or prevention of private wrongs.\"\n\nHowever, the forms of action persisted in the federal courts until 1938, when the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] were promulgated pursuant to the [[Rules Enabling Act]]. Rule 2, at that time, stated: \"There shall be one form of action to be known as 'civil action.'\"  Since 35 U.S. states now use versions of the FRCP in their state courts and the remaining 15 states are all \"code pleading\" states{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, so the forms of action are now obsolete in the United States.\n\n==See also==\n*[[cause of action]]\n*[[writ]]\n*Historians of English legal history\n**[[Frederic William Maitland|Professor FW Maitland (Cambridge)]]\n**[[James Barr Ames|Professor James Ames (Harvard)]]\n**[[William Searle Holdsworth|Professor William Holdsworth (Oxford)]]\n**[http://www.squire.law.cam.ac.uk/eminent-scholars-archive/professor-stroud-francis-charles-toby-milsom Professor SFC Milsom (Cambridge)]\n**[[John Baker (legal historian)|Professor Sir John Baker (Cambridge)]]\n**[[David Ibbetson|Professor David Ibbetson (Cambridge)]]\n**[[A.

In 1981, Wells was both the [[IAAF Golden Sprints]] and [[IAAF World Cup]] gold medallist. He is also a three-time [[European Cup (athletics)|European Cup]] gold medallist among many other sprint successes.\n\nHe was a multiple medallist for his native Scotland at the [[Commonwealth Games]], winning two golds at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] and completing a [[100 metres]]/[[200 metres]] sprint double at the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]. Wells also recorded the fastest British 100/200 times in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 100 m in 1984.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and long jump===\nBorn in [[Edinburgh]], Wells was educated at Fernieside Primary School and then [[Liberton High School]]. He left school at age 15 to begin an engineering apprenticeship.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Wells was initially a [[triple jump]]er and [[long jump]]er<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/15/50-olympic-stunning-moments-allan-wells |title=50 stunning Olympic moments No39: Allan Wells wins 100m gold in Moscow |date=15 June 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Rob Bagchi |location=London}}</ref> and crowned Scottish indoor [[long jump]] champion in 1974.\n\n===Commonwealth and European sprint titles===\nHe began concentrating on [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] events in 1976. In 1977 he won the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]]'s Indoor [[60 metres]] title, and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles.\n\nIn the 1978 season his times and victories continued to improve, he clocked a new British record at Gateshead 10.29, beating Don Quarrie and James Sanford, he also won the UK 100/[[200 metres|200]] Championships. At the [[Commonwealth Games]]<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, Canada, he won the [[gold medal]] in the 200 m and [[silver medal|silver]] in the 100 m. He also won the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100 m]] running the first leg with [[Drew McMaster]], [[David Jenkins (athlete)|David Jenkins]] and [[Cameron Sharp]] running the other three legs.\n\nThis success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in [[Turin]], Italy, beating the new World record holder [[Pietro Mennea]] on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres.\n\nWells also beat Houston Mcteer in the 100m at Gateshead.\n\n===1980 \u2013 Olympic success and the showdown in Koblenz===\n\nAt the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA's 100 metres, then went to the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Wells never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Prior to the Olympics he was put under pressure by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the boycott of the games led by the Americans. Wells responded by declining all media requests.<ref name=deepwells>[http://www.scotsman.com/sport/allan-wells-deep-wells-1-1436232 \"Allan Wells: Deep Wells\" 9 August 2008, The Scotsman]</ref><ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> His Olympic participation was threatened by chronic back pain that arrived 2\u00bd weeks before the games began. Each day he underwent four exhausting treatment sessions each day that left him too tired to train. Instead when not undergoing treatment he spent his time relaxing.<ref name=deepwells/>\n\nIn Moscow, 28-year-old Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite [[Silvio Leonard]] of [[Cuba]]. By 60 metres the field were fading, and by 80 metres the race was between Leonard on the inside and Wells on the outside. Wells edged ahead, but Leonard drew even again. With seven metres to go Wells began an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line {{convert|3|in|mm}} before Leonard's chest in a photo finish; both men were given a final time of 10.25 s.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time at the age of 28 years 83 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics-heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=6921|title=Athletics photographic encyclopedia, athlete, olympic games, world championship, european championship & hero images by sporting-heroes.net|publisher=Sporting Heroes}}</ref> He remains the last white male athlete to win the Olympic [[100 metres]] title.\n\nThe 200 m final was another close affair. Wells from lane 7, exploded out of the blocks and ran a spectacular turn making up the stagger on Mennea to his outside after only 50 metres. Coming out of the turn he had a two-metre lead over Leonard, with Quarrie close behind in third while Mennea looking fully eclipsed. But Mennea shifted gears in the straight and caught Wells with 10 metres to go. Wells attempted a final dip which had brought him victory in the 100, but he fell short, and Wells won the silver medal<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> behind Pietro Mennea, who beat him by 0.02 s; again he set a British record of 20.21 s. He went on to break a third British record, 38.62 s, with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final.\n\nIn a later interview Wells said the two issues he faced prior to the games inadvertently were key factors in his success. He said in an interview to ''[[The Scotsman]]'', \"When we got to Moscow, [my wife and coach] Margot and I decided that I'd do six starts and see how it went. The fourth and fifth were full-out as if I was competing and I asked Margot what she thought: she said they were the best she'd ever seen me do. The rest had done me a lot of good, I was really fresh and committed, and those starts gave me the psychological edge over everyone else, which was key because the Olympics is all about your mental aptitude. You're at your fastest when you're relaxed and flowing (Wells' 10.11secs to qualify for the 100m final remains the Scottish record) rather than having to be aggressive.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFollowing the Moscow Olympics, there was some suggestion that Wells's gold medal had been devalued by the boycott of the games. Wells accepted an invitation to take on the best USA sprinters of the day, among others, at a track meeting in [[Koblenz]] in West Germany. Less than two weeks after the Moscow gold, Wells (10.19) won the final in Koblenz beating Americans<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> [[Stanley Floyd]] (10.21), [[Mel Lattany]] (10.25),<ref name=deepwells/> [[Carl Lewis]] (10.30) and [[Harvey Glance]] (10.31). Lattany went straight over to Wells after crossing the line to say, \"For what it's worth, Allan, You're the Olympic champion and you would have been Olympic champion no matter who you ran against in Moscow.\"<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/>\n\nAt the end of 1980, Wells was awarded Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===1981 World Cup win===\n\nIn 1981, after a successful tour of Australia and New Zealand, Wells won the European Cup 100 metres, beating East German [[Frank Emmelmann]]. Wells also finished 2nd in the 200.\n\nHe then demonstrated his calibre by finishing first in the \"IAAF Golden sprints\" in [[Berlin]]; which was the most prominent Sprint Meeting in the World that year. Although finishing second to the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Hermann Panzo]] by 0.01 secs in the 100, Wells emphatically won the 200 beating the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany, Jeff Phillips, Stanley Floyd, Steve Williams as well as Canada's Ben Johnson in the 100/200, 10.15/20.15 (200 wind assist) for Wells to win the event in an aggregate 30.30.\n\nTo add to this, Wells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome, beating the American Champion and world's fastest 100 m performer of the year which was 10.00 by [[Carl Lewis]]; Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200.\n\nAfterwards, he beat the top Americans Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again, when he won a 200 in the [[Memorial Van Damme]] meeting in [[Brussels]], Belgium.\n\n===Later sprinting career===\n\nIn 1982, in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia, Wells won two more [[Commonwealth]] titles in the 100 m, a wind assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a [[bronze medal]] in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with [[Mike McFarlane]] of England in a rare [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]].\n\nIn 1983, he won his 3rd European Cup title by winning the 200 metres, beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London, and again took 2nd in the 100.\n\nHe then went on and finished 4th in both the 100/200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in [[Helsinki]].\n\nHe reached the 100 m semi-finals at the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]], and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final.\n\nWells missed most of 1985 with injury. He was not selected for the [[1986 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh]] in 1986, as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials. However, in a stunning comeback, he soundly beat both Johnson and Mahorn, the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions at [[Gateshead]].\n\nWells gained additional attention at Gateshead for being the first to be seen sporting the now common [[Lycra]] running shorts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/quantum-leap-in-sports-technology-1.314688|title=Quantum leap in sports technology|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-wells-warms-to-golden-oldie-day-1069350.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Simon | last=Turnbull | title=Athletics: Wells warms to golden oldie day | date=7 February 1999}}</ref> The sight of these led to him being dubbed [[Wilson of the Wizard]] (a comic book character).\n\nWells was consequently selected for [[Stuttgart]] in the European championships, coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. To add to this, he also had a victory against [[Linford Christie]] at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] at the end of 1986. One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100/200 double in 1987.\n\nWells's later career was punctuated by injury, but, by competing into his mid-30s, he helped to set the trend for sprinters to have longer careers.\n\n===After competitive retirement===\n\nAfter retirement, he was a coach for the British [[bobsleigh]] team. His wife [[Margot Wells]] was also a Scottish 100/100 hurdles champion, and they are now based in [[Guildford]], Surrey where she is a fitness consultant, and Allan is a retired systems engineer. Wells was also inducted alongside [[Eric Liddell]] and [[Wyndham Halswelle]] (two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions) into the [[Scottish Sports Hall of Fame]]. Allan currently coaches the [[Bank of Scotland]] specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter, [[Ian Mackie]].\n\nWells's personal best for the 100 metres is 10.11, and for the 200 metres is 20.21, run at the [[Moscow 1980]] games, and both are still Scottish records.\n\nWells was the first baton holder for the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], carrying the baton from [[Buckingham Palace]] in London.\n\nIn July 2014, Allan Wells received, along with his wife Margot, an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Edinburgh Napier University.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2015, a BBC documentary ([[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: ''Catch Me If You Can'') uncovered allegations by Wells' former teammate of historical doping by the 1980 Olympic 100m champion, beginning in 1977. Allan Wells forcefully denies the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32883944|title=Allan Wells 'took drugs ahead of gold medal win'|date=5 June 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{iaaf name|id=9758}}\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport9 'Thatcher tried to blackmail us not to go to Moscow.

In 1981, Wells was both the [[IAAF Golden Sprints]] and [[IAAF World Cup]] gold medallist. He is also a three-time [[European Cup (athletics)|European Cup]] gold medallist among many other sprint successes.\n\nHe was a multiple medallist for his native Scotland at the [[Commonwealth Games]], winning two golds at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] and completing a [[100 metres]]/[[200 metres]] sprint double at the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]. Wells also recorded the fastest British 100/200 times in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 100 m in 1984.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and long jump===\nBorn in [[Edinburgh]], Wells was educated at Fernieside Primary School and then [[Liberton High School]].

At the [[Commonwealth Games]]<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, Canada, he won the [[gold medal]] in the 200 m and [[silver medal|silver]] in the 100 m. He also won the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100 m]] running the first leg with [[Drew McMaster]], [[David Jenkins (athlete)|David Jenkins]] and [[Cameron Sharp]] running the other three legs.\n\nThis success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in [[Turin]], Italy, beating the new World record holder [[Pietro Mennea]] on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres.\n\nWells also beat Houston Mcteer in the 100m at Gateshead.\n\n===1980 \u2013 Olympic success and the showdown in Koblenz===\n\nAt the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA's 100 metres, then went to the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Wells never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Prior to the Olympics he was put under pressure by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the boycott of the games led by the Americans.

Each day he underwent four exhausting treatment sessions each day that left him too tired to train. Instead when not undergoing treatment he spent his time relaxing.<ref name=deepwells/>\n\nIn Moscow, 28-year-old Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite [[Silvio Leonard]] of [[Cuba]]. By 60 metres the field were fading, and by 80 metres the race was between Leonard on the inside and Wells on the outside. Wells edged ahead, but Leonard drew even again. With seven metres to go Wells began an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line {{convert|3|in|mm}} before Leonard's chest in a photo finish; both men were given a final time of 10.25 s.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time at the age of 28 years 83 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics-heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=6921|title=Athletics photographic encyclopedia, athlete, olympic games, world championship, european championship & hero images by sporting-heroes.net|publisher=Sporting Heroes}}</ref> He remains the last white male athlete to win the Olympic [[100 metres]] title.\n\nThe 200 m final was another close affair. Wells from lane 7, exploded out of the blocks and ran a spectacular turn making up the stagger on Mennea to his outside after only 50 metres. Coming out of the turn he had a two-metre lead over Leonard, with Quarrie close behind in third while Mennea looking fully eclipsed. But Mennea shifted gears in the straight and caught Wells with 10 metres to go. Wells attempted a final dip which had brought him victory in the 100, but he fell short, and Wells won the silver medal<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> behind Pietro Mennea, who beat him by 0.02 s; again he set a British record of 20.21 s. He went on to break a third British record, 38.62 s, with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final. \n\nIn a later interview Wells said the two issues he faced prior to the games inadvertently were key factors in his success. He said in an interview to ''[[The Scotsman]]'', \"When we got to Moscow, [my wife and coach] Margot and I decided that I'd do six starts and see how it went.

Wells accepted an invitation to take on the best USA sprinters of the day, among others, at a track meeting in [[Koblenz]] in West Germany. Less than two weeks after the Moscow gold, Wells (10.19) won the final in Koblenz beating Americans<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> [[Stanley Floyd]] (10.21), [[Mel Lattany]] (10.25),<ref name=deepwells/> [[Carl Lewis]] (10.30) and [[Harvey Glance]] (10.31). Lattany went straight over to Wells after crossing the line to say, \"For what it's worth, Allan, You're the Olympic champion and you would have been Olympic champion no matter who you ran against in Moscow.\"<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/>\n\nAt the end of 1980, Wells was awarded Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===1981 World Cup win===\n\nIn 1981, after a successful tour of Australia and New Zealand, Wells won the European Cup 100 metres, beating East German [[Frank Emmelmann]]. Wells also finished 2nd in the 200.\n\nHe then demonstrated his calibre by finishing first in the \"IAAF Golden sprints\" in [[Berlin]]; which was the most prominent Sprint Meeting in the World that year. Although finishing second to the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Hermann Panzo]] by 0.01 secs in the 100, Wells emphatically won the 200 beating the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany, Jeff Phillips, Stanley Floyd, Steve Williams as well as Canada's Ben Johnson in the 100/200, 10.15/20.15 (200 wind assist) for Wells to win the event in an aggregate 30.30.\n\nTo add to this, Wells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome, beating the American Champion and world's fastest 100 m performer of the year which was 10.00 by [[Carl Lewis]]; Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200.\n\nAfterwards, he beat the top Americans Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again, when he won a 200 in the [[Memorial Van Damme]] meeting in [[Brussels]], Belgium.\n\n===Later sprinting career===\n\nIn 1982, in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia, Wells won two more [[Commonwealth]] titles in the 100 m, a wind assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a [[bronze medal]] in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with [[Mike McFarlane]] of England in a rare [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]].\n\nIn 1983, he won his 3rd European Cup title by winning the 200 metres, beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London, and again took 2nd in the 100.\n\nHe then went on and finished 4th in both the 100/200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in [[Helsinki]].\n\nHe reached the 100 m semi-finals at the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]], and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final.\n\nWells missed most of 1985 with injury. He was not selected for the [[1986 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh]] in 1986, as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials. However, in a stunning comeback, he soundly beat both Johnson and Mahorn, the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions at [[Gateshead]].\n\nWells gained additional attention at Gateshead for being the first to be seen sporting the now common [[Lycra]] running shorts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/quantum-leap-in-sports-technology-1.314688|title=Quantum leap in sports technology|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-wells-warms-to-golden-oldie-day-1069350.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Simon | last=Turnbull | title=Athletics: Wells warms to golden oldie day | date=7 February 1999}}</ref> The sight of these led to him being dubbed [[Wilson of the Wizard]] (a comic book character).\n\nWells was consequently selected for [[Stuttgart]] in the European championships, coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. To add to this, he also had a victory against [[Linford Christie]] at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] at the end of 1986. One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100/200 double in 1987.\n\nWells's later career was punctuated by injury, but, by competing into his mid-30s, he helped to set the trend for sprinters to have longer careers.\n\n===After competitive retirement===\n\nAfter retirement, he was a coach for the British [[bobsleigh]] team. His wife [[Margot Wells]] was also a Scottish 100/100 hurdles champion, and they are now based in [[Guildford]], Surrey where she is a fitness consultant, and Allan is a retired systems engineer. Wells was also inducted alongside [[Eric Liddell]] and [[Wyndham Halswelle]] (two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions) into the [[Scottish Sports Hall of Fame]]. Allan currently coaches the [[Bank of Scotland]] specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter, [[Ian Mackie]].\n\nWells's personal best for the 100 metres is 10.11, and for the 200 metres is 20.21, run at the [[Moscow 1980]] games, and both are still Scottish records.\n\nWells was the first baton holder for the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], carrying the baton from [[Buckingham Palace]] in London.\n\nIn July 2014, Allan Wells received, along with his wife Margot, an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Edinburgh Napier University.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2015, a BBC documentary ([[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: ''Catch Me If You Can'') uncovered allegations by Wells' former teammate of historical doping by the 1980 Olympic 100m champion, beginning in 1977. Allan Wells forcefully denies the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32883944|title=Allan Wells 'took drugs ahead of gold medal win'|date=5 June 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{iaaf name|id=9758}}\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport9 'Thatcher tried to blackmail us not to go to Moscow.

Founded in Vienna by Scandinavian, German and Austrian students in 1961,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Students on the Right Way. European Democrat Students 1961-2011|last=Bauer|first=Bence|publisher=Wilfred Martens Center|year=2012|isbn=978-9090266671|location=Bruxelles|pages=25-32}}</ref> it represents over 1.600.000 students and young people in 40 member organisations from 35 countries in Europe, and is the largest youth organisation in Europe.\n\nIts stated goal is to promote a free, democratic and united Europe through a greater student mobility and comprehensive education policies across the continent. European Democrat Students has been always a frontrunner in integration, fighting for open borders, united Europe and European debate in European politics. The three pillars of EDS originally stood for [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]] and [[christian democracy]]. Today, EDS grew into a large family which has an outlook that is various, rich and unique, represented by the name 'Democrat': Here, student organisations, political youth organisations and other centre-right organisations come together to shape modern centre-right policies for Europe.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1958, a group of Swedish students, members of the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Conservative Student League of Sweden]], travelled to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and [[West Berlin]], where they attended the annual meeting of the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]]. A cooperation between the Swedish and West German students was initiated, that was soon extended to include student organisations from the rest of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn response to increasing activities of communist organisations, the liberal-conservative and christian democratic student organisations from these countries saw a need for stronger international cooperation among democratic student organisations in Europe. When the communist [[International Union of Students]] organised the \"7th World Youth Festival\" in Vienna in 1959, christian democratic and liberal-conservative students established the organisation ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben'' (Action Committee New Life), the first international organisation of centre-right students in Europe. The new organisation distributed pins with the text \"Remember [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary 1956]]!\"\n\n[[File:Carl Bildt under nationaldagsfirande vid Skansen 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Bildt]] proposed the current name of the organisation in 1975]]\nThe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben quickly evolved into the International Student Conferences, that took place in Copenhagen and Stockholm for the first time in 1960. At the third conference, in Vienna in 1961, the International of Christian-Democrat and Conservative Students, the predecessor of the European Democrat Students, was founded. The organisation considered itself to be the \"first avantgarde fighter for the protection of the principles of liberty and individualism,\" and supported European integration and programmes for student mobility. The founding member organisations were the [[AktionsGemeinschaft|Freie \u00d6sterreichische Studentenschaft]] (Austria), the [[Conservative Students (Denmark)|Conservative Students]] (Denmark), the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (West Germany), the [[Students' League of the Conservative Party (Norway)|Students' League of the Conservative Party]] (Norway), and the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (FMSF)]]. A few months later, the [[Federation of Conservative Students|Federation of University Conservative and Unionist Associations]] (UK) and ESC (Belgium) joined.\n\nThe current name of the organisation, European Democrat Students, was adopted in 1975, after it was proposed by [[Carl Bildt]].\n\nSince 1997, EDS has been the official student organisation of the European People's Party (EPP). Full members status is held to the [[European Youth Forum]] (YFJ), the [[International Young Democrat Union]] (IYDU) and the Robert Schuman Institute. EDS is also recognised as a member association of the [[European Peoples Party]] (EPP), where EDS is one of the six EPP associations - in addition to recognition as an [[NGO]] at the [[Council of Europe]].\n\nOrganising seminars, summer and winter universities, publications, campaigns and political resolutions, EDS connects like-minded students from all over the continent and shapes European student policies as well as the debates within the EPP. In 2011, the celebrations of the 50th anniversary have been conducted in Brussels and Vienna, attracting several hundreds of members, alumni, politicians and partners.\n\nAn important shift towards a more wide vision of the world was introduced during the working year 2017-2018 with the first Study Mission organized in Latin America under the title of \"Caja Pol\u00edtica\". A second edition was held in 2019 in [[Guayaquil]] and Quito ([[Ecuador]]) and it successfully gathered<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2019/06/05/nota/7361841/caja-politica-inicio-ciclo-conferencias|title=Caja Pol\u00edtica inici\u00f3 ciclo de conferencias Rearmando la democracia|date=2019-06-05|website=El Universo|language=es|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> young leaders from a dozen Latin American countries with representatives of the EDS Bureau and Member Organizations.

Founded in Vienna by Scandinavian, German and Austrian students in 1961,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Students on the Right Way. European Democrat Students 1961-2011|last=Bauer|first=Bence|publisher=Wilfred Martens Center|year=2012|isbn=978-9090266671|location=Bruxelles|pages=25-32}}</ref> it represents over 1.600.000 students and young people in 40 member organisations from 35 countries in Europe, and is the largest youth organisation in Europe.\n\nIts stated goal is to promote a free, democratic and united Europe through a greater student mobility and comprehensive education policies across the continent. European Democrat Students has been always a frontrunner in integration, fighting for open borders, united Europe and European debate in European politics. The three pillars of EDS originally stood for [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]] and [[christian democracy]]. Today, EDS grew into a large family which has an outlook that is various, rich and unique, represented by the name 'Democrat': Here, student organisations, political youth organisations and other centre-right organisations come together to shape modern centre-right policies for Europe.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1958, a group of Swedish students, members of the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Conservative Student League of Sweden]], travelled to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and [[West Berlin]], where they attended the annual meeting of the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]]. A cooperation between the Swedish and West German students was initiated, that was soon extended to include student organisations from the rest of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn response to increasing activities of communist organisations, the liberal-conservative and christian democratic student organisations from these countries saw a need for stronger international cooperation among democratic student organisations in Europe. When the communist [[International Union of Students]] organised the \"7th World Youth Festival\" in Vienna in 1959, christian democratic and liberal-conservative students established the organisation ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben'' (Action Committee New Life), the first international organisation of centre-right students in Europe. The new organisation distributed pins with the text \"Remember [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary 1956]]!\"\n\n[[File:Carl Bildt under nationaldagsfirande vid Skansen 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Bildt]] proposed the current name of the organisation in 1975]]\nThe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neues Leben quickly evolved into the International Student Conferences, that took place in Copenhagen and Stockholm for the first time in 1960. At the third conference, in Vienna in 1961, the International of Christian-Democrat and Conservative Students, the predecessor of the European Democrat Students, was founded. The organisation considered itself to be the \"first avantgarde fighter for the protection of the principles of liberty and individualism,\" and supported European integration and programmes for student mobility. The founding member organisations were the [[AktionsGemeinschaft|Freie \u00d6sterreichische Studentenschaft]] (Austria), the [[Conservative Students (Denmark)|Conservative Students]] (Denmark), the [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (West Germany), the [[Students' League of the Conservative Party (Norway)|Students' League of the Conservative Party]] (Norway), and the [[Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students|Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (FMSF)]]. A few months later, the [[Federation of Conservative Students|Federation of University Conservative and Unionist Associations]] (UK) and ESC (Belgium) joined.\n\nThe current name of the organisation, European Democrat Students, was adopted in 1975, after it was proposed by [[Carl Bildt]].\n\nSince 1997, EDS has been the official student organisation of the European People's Party (EPP). Full members status is held to the [[European Youth Forum]] (YFJ), the [[International Young Democrat Union]] (IYDU) and the Robert Schuman Institute. EDS is also recognised as a member association of the [[European Peoples Party]] (EPP), where EDS is one of the six EPP associations - in addition to recognition as an [[NGO]] at the [[Council of Europe]].\n\nOrganising seminars, summer and winter universities, publications, campaigns and political resolutions, EDS connects like-minded students from all over the continent and shapes European student policies as well as the debates within the EPP. In 2011, the celebrations of the 50th anniversary have been conducted in Brussels and Vienna, attracting several hundreds of members, alumni, politicians and partners.\n\nAn important shift towards a more wide vision of the world was introduced during the working year 2017-2018 with the first Study Mission organized in Latin America under the title of \"Caja Pol\u00edtica\". A second edition was held in 2019 in [[Guayaquil]] and Quito ([[Ecuador]]) and it successfully gathered<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2019/06/05/nota/7361841/caja-politica-inicio-ciclo-conferencias|title=Caja Pol\u00edtica inici\u00f3 ciclo de conferencias Rearmando la democracia|date=2019-06-05|website=El Universo|language=es|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> young leaders from a dozen Latin American countries with representatives of the EDS Bureau and Member Organizations.
