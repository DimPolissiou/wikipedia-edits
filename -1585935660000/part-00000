Before his [[Presidency of John Adams|presidency]], he was a leader of the [[American Revolution]] that achieved independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and served as the first [[vice president of the United States]]. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|early American history]], including his wife and adviser [[Abigail Adams]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]].\n\nA lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the [[right to counsel]] and [[presumption of innocence]]. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the [[Boston Massacre]]. Adams was a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty with Great Britain]] and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] in 1780, which influenced the United States' own [[United States Constitution|constitution]], as did his earlier ''[[Thoughts on Government]]''.\n\nAdams was elected to two terms as vice president under President [[George Washington]] and was elected as the United States' second president in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]. He was the first, and only, president elected under the banner of the [[Federalist Party]]. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the [[Jeffersonian Republicans]] and from some in his own [[Federalist Party]], led by his rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Adams signed the controversial [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and built up the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] in the undeclared \"[[Quasi-War]]\" with [[French First Republic|France]]. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a [[Convention of 1800|peaceful resolution]] of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the [[White House]].\n\nIn his bid for [[1800 United States presidential election|reelection]], opposition from Federalists and accusations of [[despotism]] from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the [[Adams political family]], which includes their son [[John Quincy Adams]], the sixth president of the United States. John Adams [[July 4#Deaths|died on July 4]], 1826 \u2013 the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence \u2013 hours after Jefferson's death.

He had two younger brothers, Peter (1738-1823) and [[Elihu Adams|Elihu]] (1741-1775), and a sister, Jerusha (1748-1810).{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}}{{sfn|Girard|2019|p=32}} Adams was [[John Adams Birthplace|born on the family farm]] in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=317}} His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. His father was a [[deacon]] in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Church]], a farmer, a [[cordwainer]], and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Massachusetts National Guard|militia]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29\u201330}} John Sr. served as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=11\u201314}} Adams's great-great-grandfather [[Henry Adams (farmer)|Henry Adams]] emigrated to Massachusetts from [[Braintree, Essex]], England, around 1638.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThough raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of [[Puritans]], who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams's birth, Puritan tenets such as [[predestination]] had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still \"considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency.\"{{sfn|Brookhiser|2002|p=13}} Adams recalled that his parents \"held every Species of [[Libertine|Libertinage]] in&nbsp;... Contempt and horror,\" and detailed \"pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin\" resulting from any debauchery.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}} Adams later noted that \"As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men \u2013 that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children.\"{{sfn|Kirtley|1910|p=366}}\n\nAdams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a [[dame school]] for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon ''[[The New England Primer]]''. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included [[Latin]], rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams's early education included incidents of [[truancy]], a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: \"You shall comply with my desires.\" Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=12\u201314}}\n\n===College education and adulthood===\nAt age sixteen, Adams entered [[Harvard College]] in 1751, studying under [[Joseph Mayhew]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=35}} As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]] in their original languages.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=13}} Though his father expected him to be a minister,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}} after his 1755 graduation with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B. degree]], he taught school temporarily in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving \"Honour or Reputation\" and \"more {{sic|def|ference|hide=y}} from [his] fellows\", and was determined to be \"a great Man.\" He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers \"noble and gallant achievements\" but, among the clergy, the \"pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces.\" His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described \"trumpery\" and failure to share the \"happiness of [his] fellow men.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nAs the [[French and Indian War]] began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, \"I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer,\" recognizing that he was the first of his family to \"[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=21}}\n\n===Law practice and marriage===\n{{multiple image\n | direction=horizontal\n | width=\n | footer=\n | width1=169\n | image1=Abigail Adams.jpg\n | caption1=Abigail Smith Adams \u2013 1766 Portrait by Benjamin Blyth|alt1=Woman with deep black hair and dark eyes wearing a blue and pink dress\n | width2=169\n | image2=John Adams (1766).jpg\n | caption2=John Adams \u2013 1766 Portrait also by Blyth|alt2=Man in dark gray clothing with dark hair\n}}\nIn 1756, Adams began [[reading law]] under James Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=19}} In 1758, he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] from Harvard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|title=Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees|publisher=The Harvard Gazette|date=November 6, 2008|access-date=December 5, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|archive-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref> and in 1759 was admitted to the bar.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=44}} He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included [[James Otis Jr.]]'s 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British [[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]], allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=46}}\n\nA group of Boston businessmen had been appalled at the [[writs of assistance]] that the crown had started issuing to clamp down on colonial smuggling.  Writs of assistance were not only search warrants without any limits, they also required local sheriffs, and even local citizens, to assist in breaking into colonists\u2019 houses or lend whatever assistance customs officials desired.<ref name=\"Sabine, Lorenzo pp 328-9\">Sabine, Lorenzo.

However, the case lit the fire that became the American Revolution.  Otis\u2019s arguments were published in the colonies, and stirred widespread support for colonial rights.  As a young lawyer, John Adams was observing the case in the packed courtroom, and was moved by Otis\u2019s performance and legal arguments.  Adams later said that \u201cThen and there the child Independence was born.\u201d<ref>Monk, Linda R.

He offered them anonymously, under the [[nom de plume]] \"Humphrey Ploughjogger\", and in them ridiculed the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=36\u201339}} Adams was initially less well known than his older cousin [[Samuel Adams]], but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to [[republicanism]]. Adams often found his own irascible nature a constraint in his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}}\n\nIn the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to propose but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old [[Abigail Adams|Abigail Smith]], his third cousin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintag.es/2017/05/they-did-what-15-famous-people-who.html|title=They Did What? 15 Famous People Who Actually Married Their Cousins|language=en-US|access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister. Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not \"fond, nor frank, nor candid.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=51\u201352}} In time, he grew close to Abigail and they were married on October 25, 1764, despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had inherited a {{cvt|9+1/2|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm and [[John Quincy Adams Birthplace|a house]] where they lived until 1783.<ref name=Life1961 />{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=55\u201356}} John and Abigail had six children: [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail]] \"Nabby\" in 1765,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=58}} future president [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1767,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} Susanna in 1768, [[Charles Adams (1770\u20131800)|Charles]] in 1770, [[Thomas Boylston Adams (1772\u20131832)|Thomas]] in 1772,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} and Elizabeth in 1777.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171\u2013172}} Susanna died when she was one year old,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} while Elizabeth was stillborn.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171\u2013172}} All three of his sons became lawyers.

The Act was imposed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax by the colonies for stamped documents,<ref name=\"Declaration of Independence\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript|title=Declaration of Independence: A Transcription|publisher=United States National Archives|access-date=October 1, 2018|date=November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Stamp Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/|title=Stamp Act and the beginning of political activism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614042234/http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/|publisher=John Adams Historical Society|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=July 5, 2016}}</ref> and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with France. Power of enforcement was given to British [[vice admiralty court]]s, rather than [[common law]] courts.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72\u201376}}<ref name=\"Stamp Act\"/> These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked.<ref name=\"Declaration of Independence\"/> The Act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent resistance, preventing its enforcement.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72\u201376}} Adams authored the \"[[Braintree Instructions]]\" in 1765, in the form of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it, he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nAdams also reprised his pen name \"Humphrey Ploughjogger\" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the ''[[Boston Gazette]]''. The articles were republished in ''The London Chronicle'' in 1768 as ''True Sentiments of America'', also known as ''A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law''. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=39}}{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=59\u201361}} He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister [[Jonathan Mayhew]], invoking [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13]] to justify insurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|title=Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-resistance to the Higher Powers|first=Rev.

The family rented a clapboard house on [[Brattle Street (Boston)|Brattle Street]] that was known locally as the \"White House\". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still, later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} With the death of [[Jeremiah Gridley]] and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}\n\n===Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre===\n[[File:BostonMassacre byAlonzoChappel1878.png|thumb|Boston Massacre of 1770 by Alonzo Chappel |alt=Depiction of chaotic confrontation between British soldiers and Bostonians]]\nBritain's passage of the [[Townshend Acts]] in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=57\u201359}} On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens, eight of his fellow [[29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot|soldiers]] reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous [[Boston Massacre]]. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation \u2013 he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe week-long trial of the commander, Captain [[Thomas Preston (British Army officer)|Thomas Preston]], began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=39}} The remaining soldiers were tried in December when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/05-03-02-0001-0004-0016|publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society|date=December 1770|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> He added, \"It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever.\" Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.<ref name=Life1961>{{cite magazine|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=June 30, 1961|title=Private Thoughts of a Founding Father|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407141509/http://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|archive-date=April 7, 2015|access-date=June 7, 2015|page=82}}</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer [[John E. Ferling]], during [[Voir dire|jury selection]] Adams \"expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles.\" While Adams's defence was helped by a weak prosecution, he also \"performed brilliantly.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=69}} Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=67\u201368}}\n\nThe prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, \"Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning \u2013 I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else.\" After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and \"vulgar\" Braintree as a home for his family \u2013 in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on [[Court Street (Boston)|Queen Street]], not far from his office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=74}} In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906091054/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|title=American Experience \u2013 John & Abigail Adams \u2013 Timeline|publisher=PBS|access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Becoming a revolutionary===\nAdams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=72\u201373}} His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the ''Gazette'' that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]] drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusive to the King.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=78\u201380}}\n\nThe [[Boston Tea Party]], a historic demonstration against the British [[East India Company]]'s tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner ''Dartmouth'', loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new [[Tea Act]], had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done \u2013 they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The ''Dartmouth'' owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the \"grandest Event\" in the history of the colonial protest movement,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=92\u201394}} and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an \"absolutely and indispensably\" necessary action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-02-02-0003-0008-0001 |title=1773.

You ought to do it.\" To which Adams responded, \"I will not \u2013 reasons enough.\" Jefferson replied, \"What can be your reasons?\" and Adams responded, \"Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business.

He authored the \"Plan of Treaties,\" laying out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France.{{sfn|Ellis|1993|pp=41\u201342}} As chairman of the Board, Adams functioned as a ''de facto'' Secretary of War. He kept extensive correspondences with a wide range of [[Continental Army]] officers concerning supplies, munitions, and tactics. Adams emphasized to them the role of discipline in keeping an army orderly.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=298\u2013305}} He was worn out by the rigor of his duties and longed to return home. His finances were unsteady, and the money that he received as a delegate failed even to cover his own necessary expenses. However, the crisis caused by the defeat of the American soldiers kept him at his post.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=298}}\n\nAfter defeating the Continental Army at the [[Battle of Long Island]] on August 27, British Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives to negotiate peace.

He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, \"to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers.\" While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the [[Model Treaty]]. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that \"[[freedom of navigation|free ships make free goods]],\" allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had [[Battle of Brandywine|defeated]] General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nIn November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing [[Silas Deane]] and joining Franklin and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]] invoked Adams's \"inflexible integrity\" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he \"should have wanted no motives or arguments\" for his acceptance if he \"could be sure that the public would be benefited by it.\" Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was \"of inestimable value\" to his maturation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Boston (1777)|Boston]]'', commanded by Captain [[Samuel Tucker]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=177\u2013179}} The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one of the crew and injured five others.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=186}} On April 1, the ''Boston'' arrived in France, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] with the United States on February 6.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=187}} Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=198, 209}} He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=199}} Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=210}} In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him [[minister plenipotentiary]] to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=210\u2013213}} On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Joseph Siffrein Duplessis - Benjamin Franklin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Adams frequently clashed with [[Benjamin Franklin]] over how to manage French relations.]]\nIn late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=221}} Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=451}} aboard the French frigate ''Sensible'' \u2013 accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=218}} A leak in the ship forced it to land in [[Ferrol, Spain]], and Adams and his party spent six weeks travelling overland until they reached Paris.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=452\u2013459}} Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=219\u2013222}}\n\nIn contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands \"above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=233}} In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to \"retrace its steps.\" Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|comte de Rochambeau]] had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=239\u2013241}} Adams then left France of his own accord.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=242}}\n\n===Ambassador to the Dutch Republic===\nIn mid-1780, Adams traveled to the [[Dutch Republic]]. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in [[Amsterdam]] in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam \"the capital of the reign of [[Mammon]].\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=228\u2013230}} He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at [[The Hague]] on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=254\u2013255}} In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams's secretary [[Francis Dana]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] as a [[French language|French]] interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from [[Russia]], and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams's friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=262}} In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in \"a major nervous breakdown.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=236}} That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams's stand for increased naval assistance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\nNews of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the [[States General of the Netherlands]] answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=268\u2013270}} On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch [[Patriottentijd|''Patriotten'']] leader [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders.

In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=545\u2013546}} This, and other statements, prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to \"sustain [these] pretentious ambitions.\" Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead dealing directly with the British.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=281\u2013284}} During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778, and that accepting would foster goodwill between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterward. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation,{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546\u2013547}} and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for [[Gibraltar]] might have caused significant problems.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546\u2013547}} On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=285}}\n\n===Ambassador to Great Britain===\nAdams was appointed the first [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to Great Britain]] in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, \"Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American.\"{{sfn|Adams|Adams|1851|p=392}}\n\n[[File:JohnAdams.png|thumb|left|Portrait by Mather Brown|right|Adams \u2013 1785 [[Mather Brown]] Portrait]]\nAfter arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with [[King George III]] on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality \"between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood,\" and the King agreed to \"receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States.\" The King added that although \"he had been the last to consent\" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that \"There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France.\" Adams replied, \"That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country.\" To this King George responded, \"An honest Man will never have any other.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0078#ADMS-06-17-02-0078-fn-0013 |title=From John Adams to John Jay, 2 June 1785 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out [[Richard Price]], minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] and instigator of the [[Revolution Controversy|debate over the Revolution]] within Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=343\u2013344}} Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], cautioning the former against the \"smell of the midnight lamp\" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=364\u2013365}} Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=354\u2013357}} While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:\n\n{{quote|His abilities are undoubtedly equal to the mechanical parts of his business as ambassador, but this is not enough. He cannot dance, drink, game, flatter, promise, dress, swear with the gentlemen, and small talk and flirt with the ladies; in short, he has none of those essential arts or ornaments which constitute a courtier.

The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams's attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=655}} The news he received of tumult at home, such as [[Shays' Rebellion]], heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved;{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=702}} in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=729}} Adams then went to [[The Hague]] to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=382}}\n\n==Vice presidency, 1789\u20131797==\n===Election===\nOn June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|presidential election]] was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go to a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=389\u2013392}} Each state's [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential electors]] gathered on February 4, 1789, to cast their [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|two votes for the president]].

As a result, Washington became the nation's [[List of Presidents of the United States|first president]], and Adams became its first [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|vice president]]. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=393\u2013394}} To Benjamin Rush, he wrote, \"Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?\" Unbeknownst to Adams, [[Alexander Hamilton]] convinced many electors to not vote for him, under the pretext of not embarrassing Washington, to be absolutely sure that Adams did not win.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nAlthough his term was scheduled to start on March 4, 1789, Adams did not become Vice President of the United States until April 21, because [[1st United States Congress|Congress]] could not initially achieve a [[quorum]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Vice Presidential Inaugurations| url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/vice-president-inaugurations |publisher=Architect of the Capitol| location=Washington, DC| access-date=July 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\n[[File:Official Presidential portrait of John Adams (by John Trumbull, circa 1792).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Portrait of Adams by [[John Trumbull]], 1793]]\nThe sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where he can cast a tie-breaking vote.<ref name=\"USSadamsdoc\">{{Include-USGov| agency= United States Senate| article= Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)| url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm#2| access-date= July 23, 2017}}</ref> Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as \"George Washington, President of the United States\", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of ''Highness'' (as well as the title of ''Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties'') for the president.{{sfn|Hutson|1968|pp=30\u201339}} Some senators favored a variant of ''Highness'' or the lesser ''Excellency''.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=404\u2013405}} [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-federalists]] in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as \"superlatively ridiculous.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=410}} The Senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism, and many argued that these \"distinctions,\" as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's [[Title of Nobility Clause|prohibition on titles of nobility]]. Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with \"dignity and splendor\" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. \"For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair,\" wrote Senator [[William Maclay (Pennsylvania senator)|William Maclay]] of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams's fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private. He likened Adams to \"a monkey just put into breeches.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=406\u2013408}} [[Ralph Izard]] suggested that Adams be referred to by the title \"His Rotundity,\" a joke which soon became popular.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=408}} On May 14, the Senate decided that the title of \"[[Mr. President (title)|Mr. President]]\" would be used.{{sfn|Wood|2006|p=54}} Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people.

Washington rarely consulted Vice President Adams, who often felt marginalized and overshadowed by Washington's prestige.]]\nAs vice president, Adams largely sided with the Washington administration and the emerging [[Federalist Party]]. He supported Washington's policies against opposition from anti-Federalists and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republicans]]. He cast 31 [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes]], all in support of the administration, and more than any other vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=460}} He voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=413\u2013414}} In 1790, Jefferson, [[James Madison]], and Hamilton struck a [[Compromise of 1790|bargain]] guaranteeing Republican support for Hamilton's [[Funding Act of 1790|debt assumption plan]] in exchange for the capital being temporarily moved from New York to [[Philadelphia]], and then to a permanent site on the [[Potomac River]] to placate Southerners. In the Senate, Adams cast a tie-breaking nay vote against a last-minute motion to keep the capital in New York.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=425\u2013426}}\n\nAdams played a minor role in politics as vice president.

Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=550}} He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were \"struck dumb.\"{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=957\u2013960}} [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], editor of the ''[[Philadelphia Aurora]],'' blamed Adams's aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=498}}\n\n===Alien and Sedition Acts===\n{{Main|Alien and Sedition Acts}}\nDespite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], which were signed by Adams in June 1798.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=365\u2013368}} Congress specifically passed four measures \u2013 the [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an \"unguarded passion.\" The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish \"false, scandalous, and malicious writing\" against the government or its officials.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=365}} Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Jefferson, Adams's vice president, attempted to undermine many of his actions as president and eventually defeated him for reelection.]]\nThe administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=668}} Congressman [[Matthew Lyon]] of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the president.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=575}} Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=367}} Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the \"natural right\" to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to \"sever ourselves from the union we so much value.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=520\u2013521}} Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=573\u2013575}}\n\n===Quasi-War===\nIn May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=553}} Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=356\u2013357}} In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other \"High Federalists\" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a \"provisional\" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams's requests but fell short of Hamilton's.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=552\u2013553}}\n\nAdams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=376}} Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have [[Henry Knox]] as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=376\u2013377}} On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=555}} Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to [[Mount Vernon]] to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=978}} Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380\u2013381}} Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=982\u2013983}} The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380\u2013381}}\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Hamilton's desire for high military rank and his push for war with France put him into conflict with Adams.]]\nIt quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's ''de facto'' commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding [[six original United States frigates|six fast, powerful frigates]], most notably the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=507}}\n\nThe Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]], which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=516\u2013517}} In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=592\u2013593}} Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize [[Spanish Florida]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]], ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=518}}\n\nOn February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat [[William Vans Murray]] on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a \"master stroke.\" To placate Republicans, he nominated [[Patrick Henry]] and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose [[William Richardson Davie]] to replace him.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=523\u2013525}} Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams's cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593\u2013594}} To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months \u2013 March to September \u2013 of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the [[yellow fever]] epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=526\u2013529}} Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=304}} Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the president, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] to France. \"I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool,\" Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=530\u2013531}}\n\n===Fries's Rebellion===\n{{main|Fries's Rebellion}}\nTo pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the [[direct tax|Direct Tax]] of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from [[excise tax]]es and [[Tariffs in United States history|tariffs]]. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[land value tax]] of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran [[John Fries]], rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=696\u2013700}} The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.{{sfn|Diggins|2003|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nFries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=540\u2013541}} In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that \"it was impossible to commit a greater error.\"<ref name=\"Adams Pamphlet\">{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0110-0002#ARHN-01-25-02-0110-0002-fn-0166-ptr |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq.

Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and [[Samuel Dexter]] as Secretary of War.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=538\u2013539}}{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1028\u20131029}} In 1799, [[Napoleon]] took over as head of the French government in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] and declared the French Revolution over.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=534}} News of this event increased Adams's desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539\u2013540}} His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=395}} Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539\u2013540}}\n\nNapoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the [[Convention of 1800]], the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16\u201314 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance of 1778]] be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22\u20139 and was signed by Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=150}}{{efn|Jefferson, after entering office, approved a negotiated end to the 1778 alliance, freeing the United States of foreign entanglements, while excusing France from paying indemnities.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=423}}}}\n\nAs president, Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.

The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.<ref name=\"Ferling, ch. 19\">Ferling, ch. 19.</ref>\n\nThe campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of \"all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion.\" They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored [[Sally Hemings|affairs]] with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=543\u2013545}} [[James T. Callender]], a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams's character and accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=536\u2013537}}\n\nOpposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=544}} Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams's character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=619\u2013620}} The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors.

Hamilton did not heed their advice.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=549}} On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams's policies and character. Hamilton denounced the \"precipitate nomination\" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the president's \"disgusting egotism\" and \"ungovernable temper.\" Adams, he concluded, was \"emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president.\"<ref name=\"Adams Pamphlet\"/> Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=320\u2013321}} The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams's already-likely defeat.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}}\n\nWhen the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory.

Most of these judges lost their posts when the [[7th United States Congress|7th Congress]], with a solid Republican majority, approved the [[Judiciary Act of 1802]], abolishing the newly created courts.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=408\u2013410}}\n\n==Retirement==\n===Initial years===\nAdams resumed farming at [[Peacefield]] in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=421\u2013423}} Most of Adams's attention was focused on farm work.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=435}} He regularly worked around the farm but mostly left manual labor to hired hands.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=1075}} His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In 1803, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=435}} During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] and [[Benjamin Rush]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=426}}\n\nAdams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as president,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=595}} believing that \"instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice.\"<ref name=\"Adams 1808\">{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-5238 |title=From John Adams to Benjamin Rush, 18 April 1808 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the president by revealing the [[Sally Hemings]] affair, Adams said nothing.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=579\u2013585}} John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=586}} The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his \"partiality for monarchy\" and \"pride of talents and much ambition.\" A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=594\u2013596}} Adams did privately criticize the President over his [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]],<ref name=\"Adams 1808\"/> despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=598\u2013599}} John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since \"abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=599}}\n\nAfter Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the ''[[Boston Patriot (newspaper)|Boston Patriot]]'' newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and \"had gathered dust for eight years.\" Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|a duel with Aaron Burr]], Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429\u2013430}} Adams supported the [[War of 1812]]. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a \"national character\" that accompanied it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=425\u2013426}} Adams supported [[James Madison]] for reelection to the presidency in [[1812 United States presidential election|1812]].{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1107\u20131108}}\n\nDaughter [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail (\"Nabby\")]] was married to [[Congressman|Representative]] [[William Stephens Smith]], but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of [[breast cancer]] in 1813.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=430}}\n\n===Correspondence with Jefferson===\nIn early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter [[Mary Jefferson Eppes|Polly]], who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=431}}\n\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Portrait of John Adams - Samuel Finley Breese Morse - overall.jpg|thumb|right|John Adams, c. 1816, by [[Samuel Morse]] ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art|Brooklyn Museum]])|alt=An unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair, slightly pointing left.]]\n\nIn early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429\u2013430}} Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters \u2013 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=431\u2013432}}\n\nEarly on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=607}} Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that \"nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, June 27, 1813. Cappon p. 338.</ref> Adams made one more attempt, writing that \"You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.\"<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, July 15, 1813. Cappon p. 358.</ref> Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=608}}{{efn|The two men discussed \"natural aristocracy.\" Jefferson said, \"The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [aristocrats] into the offices of government?\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, October 28, 1813. Cappon, p. 388.</ref> Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, \"Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence.\" It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than wisdom and virtue. A good government had to account for that reality.<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, November 15, 1813. Cappon, p. 400.</ref>}}\n\nAs the two men became older, the letters grew fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=634}}\n\n===Last years and death===\nAbigail died of [[typhoid]] on October 28, 1818, at their Quincy home, Peacefield.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=437}} \n\nThe year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a [[1824 United States presidential election|four-way presidential contest]] which included John Quincy. The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] toured the country and met with Adams, who greatly enjoyed LaFayette's visit to Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=637}} Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives.

While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized [[Thomas Paine]]'s 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by [[John Locke]]. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had \"a better hand at pulling down than building.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=97}} He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were \"so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work.\"{{sfn|Foot|Kramnick|1987|p=11}} What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement.{{sfn|Gimbel|1956|p=21}} Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' and styled as \"a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend.\" Many historians agree that none of Adams's other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155\u2013157}}\n\nAdams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends \u2013 the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, \"There is no good government but what is [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]]. That the only valuable part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]] is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men.\" The treatise defended [[bicameralism]], for \"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual.\"<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], Vol. IV, p. 195, \"Thoughts on Government\"</ref> Adams suggested that there should be a [[separation of powers]] between the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[judicial]] and the [[legislative]] branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it \"should sacredly be confined\" to certain [[enumerated powers]]. ''Thoughts on Government'' was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that [[John Dickinson]]'s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155\u2013157}}\n\n===Massachusetts Constitution===\nAfter returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779\u20131780|Massachusetts Constitutional Convention]] with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and [[James Bowdoin]], to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive \u2013 though restrained by an executive council \u2013 with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to \"hold their offices during good behavior.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nThe Constitution affirmed the \"duty\" of the individual to worship the \"Supreme Being,\" and that he had the right to do so without molestation \"in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=222}} It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=272}} Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He believed that people \"in a State of Ignorance\" were more easily enslaved while those \"enlightened with knowledge\" would be better able to protect their liberties.{{sfn|Burns|2013|p=76}} Adams became one of the founders of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.{{sfn|Cochrane|1978|p=7}}\n\n===''Defence of the Constitutions''===\nAdams's preoccupation with political and governmental affairs \u2013 which caused considerable separation from his wife and children \u2013 had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: \"I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nWhile in London, Adams learned of a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] being planned to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In January 1787, he published a work entitled ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |title=John Adams: Defence of the Constitutions, 1787 |publisher=Constitution.org |access-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125085353/http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |archive-date=January 25, 2010  }}</ref> The pamphlet repudiated the views of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that \"the rich, the well-born and the able\" should be set apart from other men in a senate \u2013 that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams's ''Defence'' is described as an articulation of the theory of [[mixed government]]. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to [[Aristotle]], a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy \u2013 that is, the king, the nobles, and the people \u2013 was required to preserve order and liberty.{{sfn|Adams|1954|p=xvii}}\n\nHistorian [[Gordon S. Wood]] has maintained that Adams's political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of [[popular sovereignty]] was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.{{sfn|Wood|2006|pp=173\u2013202}} Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams's peculiar definition of the term \"republic,\" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=317}}\n\nOn [[separation of powers]], Adams wrote that, \"Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest.\"<ref name=\"Works of John Adams, IV:557\">Works of John Adams, IV:557</ref> This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, \"[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition,\" in [[Federalist No. 51]], explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution.<ref name=\"Works of John Adams, IV:557\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Madison |first=James|title=The Federalist No. 51 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Federalist_Papers/No._51&oldid=504230}}</ref> Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against \"aristocrats\" attempting to take it away.<ref name=\"Ralston\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/amer-enl/#SH3d |title=American Enlightenment Thought |last=Ralston |first=Shane J. |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref> On the government's role in education Adams stated that, \"The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.\"<ref>Adams, Letter to [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]], Vol. 9, p. 540.</ref>\n\nAdams first saw the new [[United States Constitution]] in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it \"with great satisfaction.\" Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without [[United States Senate|Senate]] approval and over the absence of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. \"Should not such a thing have preceded the model?\" he asked.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=379}}\n\n==Political philosophy and views==\n===Slavery===\nAdams never owned a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, \"I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap.\"<ref name=RJEvans>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=Letter to Robert J. Evans|date=June 8, 1819}}</ref> Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=77}} Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should \"sleep for a time.\" He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners.{{sfn|Wiencek|2004|p=215}} Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution.{{sfn|Moore|1866|pp=200\u2013203}} Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=26}}\n\n===Accusations of monarchism===\nThroughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions.<ref name=\"Mark O.

He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ...

There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse.{{sfn|Adams|2004|p=466}}}}\n\nAccording to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: [[political science|practical study]] of past and present governments, and [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11\u201314}} Adams's conclusion was that the great danger was that an [[oligarchy]] of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11\u201314}}<ref name=\"Ralston\"/>\n\n===Religious views===\n\nAdams was raised a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], since his ancestors were Puritans.

Wood]] (2017) writes, \"Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings.\"{{sfn|Wood|2017|p=16}}\n\nIn his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], rejecting the divinity of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=433\u2013434}} David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|his miracles]] as true.{{sfn|Holmes|2006|pp=73\u201378}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n{{see also|Bibliography of John Adams}}\nFranklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, \"He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses.\"{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=518}} Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and honorable career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}}{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=520}}\n\nHistorian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=647}} He was often described as \"prickly\", but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in the face of universal opposition.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: \"[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore.\"{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=57}} Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. \"Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right,\" he wrote.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=272}} His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=90\u201391}} Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/impact-and-legacy |title=John Adams: Impact and Legacy |last=Taylor |first=C.

The country tended further away from Adams's emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] and then [[Jacksonian democracy]] grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=4}} When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[William Henry Harrison]] was attacked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.{{sfn|Shafer|2016|pp=128\u2013129}} Adams was eventually subject to criticism from [[states' rights]] advocates. [[Edward A. Pollard]], a strong supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], singled out Adams, writing:\n\n{{quote|The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the supremacy of the \"National\" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment in each of the Middle States. The \"[[strict constructionism|strict constructionists]]\" of the Constitution were not slow in raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.{{sfn|Pollard|1862|p=12}}}}\n\nIn the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough argued that \"[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him.\" Todd Leopold of [[CNN]] wrote in 2001 that Adams is \"remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues.\"<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/06/07/david.mccullough/ |title=David McCullough brings 'John Adams' to life |last=Leopold |first=Todd |publisher=CNN |date=June 7, 2006 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> He has always been seen, Ferling says, as \"honest and dedicated\", but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=2\u20133}} Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as \"staunch, honest, stubborn and somewhat narrow.\"{{sfn|Chinard|1933|p=vi}} In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that \"Adams was his own worst enemy.\" He criticizes him for his \"pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity\", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published ''The Character of John Adams''. Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one \"perpetually at war with himself\", whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nIn 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, \"plays down or explains away\" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams's reputation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27maiert.html |title=Plain Speaking: In David McCullough's telling, the second president is reminiscent of the 33rd (Harry Truman) |last=Maier |first=Pauline |date=May 27, 2001 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> In 2008, a [[John Adams (miniseries)|miniseries]] was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring [[Paul Giamatti]] as Adams.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-giamatti13apr13-story.html |title=Paul Giamatti is so imperfect for the role |last=Lieberman |first=Paul |date=April 13, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In memoriam===\n{{main|List of memorials to John Adams}}\nAdams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items.<ref name=\"OLC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/adams.html |title=The John Adams Building |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adamscounty.us/Pages/County-Facts.aspx |title=County Facts |publisher=Adams County, PA |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/Historical/naming_mount_adams.shtml |title=Naming the Cascade Range Volcanoes Mount Adams, Washington |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> One example is the [[John Adams Building]] of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence Adams had signed into law.<ref name=\"OLC\"/> Unlike many other Founders, Adams does not have a monument dedicated to him in Washington, D.C.,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-doesnt-john-adams-have-a-memorial-in-washington/2011/06/30/AGTvmrtH_story.html |title=Why doesn't John Adams have a memorial in Washington? |last=Heffner |first=Alexander |date=July 1, 2011 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> although a family inclusive [[Adams Memorial]] was authorized in 2001 and awaits funding.

Before his [[Presidency of John Adams|presidency]], he was a leader of the [[American Revolution]] that achieved independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and served as the first [[vice president of the United States]]. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|early American history]], including his wife and adviser [[Abigail Adams]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]].\n\nA lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the [[right to counsel]] and [[presumption of innocence]]. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the [[Boston Massacre]]. Adams was a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty with Great Britain]] and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] in 1780, which influenced the United States' own [[United States Constitution|constitution]], as did his earlier ''[[Thoughts on Government]]''.\n\nAdams was elected to two terms as vice president under President [[George Washington]] and was elected as the United States' second president in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]. He was the first, and only, president elected under the banner of the [[Federalist Party]]. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the [[Jeffersonian Republicans]] and from some in his own [[Federalist Party]], led by his rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Adams signed the controversial [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and built up the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] in the undeclared \"[[Quasi-War]]\" with [[French First Republic|France]]. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a [[Convention of 1800|peaceful resolution]] of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the [[White House]].\n\nIn his bid for [[1800 United States presidential election|reelection]], opposition from Federalists and accusations of [[despotism]] from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the [[Adams political family]], which includes their son [[John Quincy Adams]], the sixth president of the United States. John Adams [[July 4#Deaths|died on July 4]], 1826 \u2013 the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence \u2013 hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|favorably ranked his administration]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of John Adams.svg|thumb|[[List of personal coats of arms of presidents of the United States|Coat of Arms of John Adams]]]]\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:John Adams birthplace, Quincy, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|Adams's birthplace in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]|alt=Small wooden house with red-brick chimney in the middle]]\nJohn Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]), to [[John Adams Sr.]] and [[Susanna Boylston]]. He had two younger brothers, Peter (1738-1823) and [[Elihu Adams|Elihu]] (1741-1775), and a sister, Jerusha (1748-1810).{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}}{{sfn|Girard|2019|32}} Adams was [[John Adams Birthplace|born on the family farm]] in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=317}} His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. His father was a [[deacon]] in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Church]], a farmer, a [[cordwainer]], and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Massachusetts National Guard|militia]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29\u201330}} John Sr. served as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=11\u201314}} Adams's great-great-grandfather [[Henry Adams (farmer)|Henry Adams]] emigrated to Massachusetts from [[Braintree, Essex]], England, around 1638.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThough raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of [[Puritans]], who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams's birth, Puritan tenets such as [[predestination]] had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still \"considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency.\"{{sfn|Brookhiser|2002|p=13}} Adams recalled that his parents \"held every Species of [[Libertine|Libertinage]] in&nbsp;... Contempt and horror,\" and detailed \"pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin\" resulting from any debauchery.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}} Adams later noted that \"As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men \u2013 that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children.\"{{sfn|Kirtley|1910|p=366}}\n\nAdams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a [[dame school]] for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon ''[[The New England Primer]]''. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included [[Latin]], rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams's early education included incidents of [[truancy]], a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: \"You shall comply with my desires.\" Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=12\u201314}}\n\n===College education and adulthood===\nAt age sixteen, Adams entered [[Harvard College]] in 1751, studying under [[Joseph Mayhew]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=35}} As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]] in their original languages.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=13}} Though his father expected him to be a minister,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}} after his 1755 graduation with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B. degree]], he taught school temporarily in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving \"Honour or Reputation\" and \"more {{sic|def|ference|hide=y}} from [his] fellows\", and was determined to be \"a great Man.\" He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers \"noble and gallant achievements\" but, among the clergy, the \"pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces.\" His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described \"trumpery\" and failure to share the \"happiness of [his] fellow men.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nAs the [[French and Indian War]] began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, \"I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer,\" recognizing that he was the first of his family to \"[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=21}}\n\n===Law practice and marriage===\n{{multiple image\n | direction=horizontal\n | width=\n | footer=\n | width1=169\n | image1=Abigail Adams.jpg\n | caption1=Abigail Smith Adams \u2013 1766 Portrait by Benjamin Blyth|alt1=Woman with deep black hair and dark eyes wearing a blue and pink dress\n | width2=169\n | image2=John Adams (1766).jpg\n | caption2=John Adams \u2013 1766 Portrait also by Blyth|alt2=Man in dark gray clothing with dark hair\n}}\nIn 1756, Adams began [[reading law]] under James Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=19}} In 1758, he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] from Harvard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|title=Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees|publisher=The Harvard Gazette|date=November 6, 2008|access-date=December 5, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|archive-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref> and in 1759 was admitted to the bar.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=44}} He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included [[James Otis Jr.]]'s 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British [[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]], allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=46}}\n\nA group of Boston businessmen had been appalled at the [[writs of assistance]] that the crown had started issuing to clamp down on colonial smuggling.  Writs of assistance were not only search warrants without any limits, they also required local sheriffs, and even local citizens, to assist in breaking into colonists\u2019 houses or lend whatever assistance customs officials desired.<ref name=\"Sabine, Lorenzo pp 328-9\">Sabine, Lorenzo.

However, the case lit the fire that became the American Revolution.  Otis\u2019s arguments were published in the colonies, and stirred widespread support for colonial rights.

In it, he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nAdams also reprised his pen name \"Humphrey Ploughjogger\" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the ''[[Boston Gazette]]''. The articles were republished in ''The London Chronicle'' in 1768 as ''True Sentiments of America'', also known as ''A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law''. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=39}}{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=59\u201361}} He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister [[Jonathan Mayhew]], invoking [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13]] to justify insurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|title=Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-resistance to the Higher Powers|first=Rev.

The family rented a clapboard house on [[Brattle Street (Boston)|Brattle Street]] that was known locally as the \"White House\". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still, later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} With the death of [[Jeremiah Gridley]] and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}\n\n===Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre===\n[[File:BostonMassacre byAlonzoChappel1878.png|thumb|Boston Massacre of 1770 by Alonzo Chappel |alt=Depiction of chaotic confrontation between British soldiers and Bostonians]]\nBritain's passage of the [[Townshend Acts]] in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=57\u201359}} On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens, eight of his fellow [[29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot|soldiers]] reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous [[Boston Massacre]]. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation \u2013 he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe week-long trial of the commander, Captain [[Thomas Preston (British Army officer)|Thomas Preston]], began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=39}} The remaining soldiers were tried in December when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/05-03-02-0001-0004-0016|publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society|date=December 1770|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> He added, \"It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever.\" Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.<ref name=Life1961>{{cite magazine|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=June 30, 1961|title=Private Thoughts of a Founding Father|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407141509/http://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|archive-date=April 7, 2015|access-date=June 7, 2015|page=82}}</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer [[John E. Ferling]], during [[Voir dire|jury selection]] Adams \"expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles.\" While Adams's defence was helped by a weak prosecution, he also \"performed brilliantly.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=69}} Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=67\u201368}}\n\nThe prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, \"Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning \u2013 I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else.\" After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and \"vulgar\" Braintree as a home for his family \u2013 in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on [[Court Street (Boston)|Queen Street]], not far from his office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=74}} In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906091054/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archive-date=September 6, 2015|title=American Experience \u2013 John & Abigail Adams \u2013 Timeline|publisher=PBS|access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Becoming a revolutionary===\nAdams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=72\u201373}} His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the ''Gazette'' that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]] drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusive to the King.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=78\u201380}}\n\nThe [[Boston Tea Party]], a historic demonstration against the British [[East India Company]]'s tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner ''Dartmouth'', loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new [[Tea Act]], had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done \u2013 they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The ''Dartmouth'' owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the \"grandest Event\" in the history of the colonial protest movement,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=92\u201394}} and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an \"absolutely and indispensably\" necessary action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-02-02-0003-0008-0001 |title=1773.

When Lord Howe stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects, Adams replied, \"Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=157}} Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=158}} Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=164\u201365}} He was able to return home to Braintree in October before leaving in January 1777 to resume his duties in Congress.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=308\u2013312}}\n\n==Diplomatic service==\n{{main|Diplomacy of John Adams}}\n\n===Commissioner to France===\nBefore the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely, trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with [[Early modern France|France]]. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, \"to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers.\" While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the [[Model Treaty]]. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that \"[[freedom of navigation|free ships make free goods]],\" allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had [[Battle of Brandywine|defeated]] General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nIn November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing [[Silas Deane]] and joining Franklin and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]] invoked Adams's \"inflexible integrity\" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he \"should have wanted no motives or arguments\" for his acceptance if he \"could be sure that the public would be benefited by it.\" Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was \"of inestimable value\" to his maturation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Boston (1777)|Boston]]'', commanded by Captain [[Samuel Tucker]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=177\u2013179}} The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one of the crew and injured five others.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=186}} On April 1, the ''Boston'' arrived in France, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] with the United States on February 6.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=187}} Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=198, 209}} He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=199}} Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=210}} In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him [[minister plenipotentiary]] to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=210\u2013213}} On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Joseph Siffrein Duplessis - Benjamin Franklin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Adams frequently clashed with [[Benjamin Franklin]] over how to manage French relations.]]\nIn late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=221}} Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=451}} aboard the French frigate ''Sensible'' \u2013 accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=218}} A leak in the ship forced it to land in [[Ferrol, Spain]], and Adams and his party spent six weeks travelling overland until they reached Paris.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=452\u2013459}} Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=219\u2013222}}\n\nIn contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands \"above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=233}} In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to \"retrace its steps.\" Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|comte de Rochambeau]] had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=239\u2013241}} Adams then left France of his own accord.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=242}}\n\n===Ambassador to the Dutch Republic===\nIn mid-1780, Adams traveled to the [[Dutch Republic]]. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in [[Amsterdam]] in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam \"the capital of the reign of [[Mammon]].\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=228\u2013230}} He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at [[The Hague]] on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=254\u2013255}} In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams's secretary [[Francis Dana]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] as a [[French language|French]] interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from [[Russia]], and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams's friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=262}} In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in \"a major nervous breakdown.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=236}} That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams's stand for increased naval assistance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\nNews of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the [[States General of the Netherlands]] answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=268\u2013270}} On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch [[Patriottentijd|''Patriotten'']] leader [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171\u2013173}} The house that Adams bought during this stay in the [[Netherlands]] became the first American embassy on foreign soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |title=Dutch American Friendship Day / Heritage Day \u2013 U.S. Embassy The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=U.S. Embassy |date=November 16, 1991 |access-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527103140/http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |archive-date=May 27, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Paris===\n[[File:Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West 1783.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The United States delegation at the Treaty of Paris by [[Benjamin West]]]]\nAfter negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the war-ending treaty, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Vergennes still disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Jay]], and [[Henry Laurens]] were appointed to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ferling, ch. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off [[Newfoundland]] and [[Cape Breton Island]] proved both very important and very difficult. In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=545\u2013546}} This, and other statements, prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to \"sustain [these] pretentious ambitions.\" Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead dealing directly with the British.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=281\u2013284}} During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778, and that accepting would foster goodwill between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterward. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation,{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546\u2013547}} and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for [[Gibraltar]] might have caused significant problems.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546\u2013547}} On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=285}}\n\n===Ambassador to Great Britain===\nAdams was appointed the first [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to Great Britain]] in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, \"Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American.\"{{sfn|Adams|Adams|1851|p=392}}\n\n[[File:JohnAdams.png|thumb|left|Portrait by Mather Brown|right|Adams \u2013 1785 [[Mather Brown]] Portrait]]\nAfter arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with [[King George III]] on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality \"between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood,\" and the King agreed to \"receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States.\" The King added that although \"he had been the last to consent\" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that \"There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France.\" Adams replied, \"That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country.\" To this King George responded, \"An honest Man will never have any other.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0078#ADMS-06-17-02-0078-fn-0013 |title=From John Adams to John Jay, 2 June 1785 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out [[Richard Price]], minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] and instigator of the [[Revolution Controversy|debate over the Revolution]] within Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=343\u2013344}} Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], cautioning the former against the \"smell of the midnight lamp\" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=364\u2013365}} Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=354\u2013357}} While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:\n\n{{quote|His abilities are undoubtedly equal to the mechanical parts of his business as ambassador, but this is not enough. He cannot dance, drink, game, flatter, promise, dress, swear with the gentlemen, and small talk and flirt with the ladies; in short, he has none of those essential arts or ornaments which constitute a courtier. There are thousands who, with a tenth of his understanding and without a spark of his honesty, would distance him infinitely in any court in Europe.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=348\u2013350}}}}\n\nAdams's tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams's attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=655}} The news he received of tumult at home, such as [[Shays' Rebellion]], heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved;{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=702}} in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=729}} Adams then went to [[The Hague]] to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=382}}\n\n==Vice presidency, 1789\u20131797==\n===Election===\nOn June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|presidential election]] was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go to a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=389\u2013392}} Each state's [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential electors]] gathered on February 4, 1789, to cast their [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|two votes for the president]].

As a result, Washington became the nation's [[List of Presidents of the United States|first president]], and Adams became its first [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|vice president]]. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=393\u2013394}} To Benjamin Rush, he wrote, \"Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?\" Unbeknownst to Adams, [[Alexander Hamilton]] convinced many electors to not vote for him, under the pretext of not embarrassing Washington, to be absolutely sure that Adams did not win.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nAlthough his term was scheduled to start on March 4, 1789, Adams did not become Vice President of the United States until April 21, because [[1st United States Congress|Congress]] could not initially achieve a [[quorum]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Vice Presidential Inaugurations| url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/vice-president-inaugurations |publisher=Architect of the Capitol| location=Washington, DC| access-date=July 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\n[[File:Official Presidential portrait of John Adams (by John Trumbull, circa 1792).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Portrait of Adams by [[John Trumbull]], 1793]]\nThe sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where he can cast a tie-breaking vote.<ref name=\"USSadamsdoc\">{{Include-USGov| agency= United States Senate| article= Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)| url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm#2| access-date= July 23, 2017}}</ref> Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government.

Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with \"dignity and splendor\" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. \"For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair,\" wrote Senator [[William Maclay (Pennsylvania senator)|William Maclay]] of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams's fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private.

Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France.{{sfn|Wood|2009|pp=174\u2013177, 240}} The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=82}} When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=342\u2013345}}\n\nOn May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ja97-03.asp|title=John Adams \u2013 Special Message to the Senate and the House; May 16 1797|publisher=Avalon Project, Yale Law School|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the \"emblems of defense\" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=484\u2013485}}\n\nSentiments changed with the [[XYZ Affair]]. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of [[John Marshall]], [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[Elbridge Gerry]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but \"then drag out the negotiations at length\" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams \"vain, suspicious, and stubborn.\"{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=547}} When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-2180|title=Epitomy, and Remarks on Actions of Ministers at Paris, 22 October 1797|publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society|access-date=December 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224233331/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-2180|archive-date=December 24, 2019|url-status=bot: unknown}}[This is an Early Access document from The Adams Papers.

Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=550}} He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were \"struck dumb.\"{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=957\u2013960}} [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], editor of the ''[[Philadelphia Aurora]],'' blamed Adams's aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=498}}\n\n===Alien and Sedition Acts===\n{{Main|Alien and Sedition Acts}}\nDespite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], which were signed by Adams in June 1798.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=365\u2013368}} Congress specifically passed four measures \u2013 the [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an \"unguarded passion.\" The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish \"false, scandalous, and malicious writing\" against the government or its officials.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=365}} Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Jefferson, Adams's vice president, attempted to undermine many of his actions as president and eventually defeated him for reelection.]]\nThe administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=668}} Congressman [[Matthew Lyon]] of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the president.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=575}} Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=367}} Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the \"natural right\" to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to \"sever ourselves from the union we so much value.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=520\u2013521}} Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=573\u2013575}}\n\n===Quasi-War===\nIn May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=553}} Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=356\u2013357}} In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other \"High Federalists\" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a \"provisional\" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams's requests but fell short of Hamilton's.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=552\u2013553}}\n\nAdams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=376}} Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have [[Henry Knox]] as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=376\u2013377}} On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=555}} Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to [[Mount Vernon]] to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=978}} Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380\u2013381}} Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=982\u2013983}} The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380\u2013381}}\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Hamilton's desire for high military rank and his push for war with France put him into conflict with Adams.]]\nIt quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's ''de facto'' commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding [[six original United States frigates|six fast, powerful frigates]], most notably the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=507}}\n\nThe Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]], which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=516\u2013517}} In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=592\u2013593}} Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize [[Spanish Florida]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]], ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=518}}\n\nOn February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat [[William Vans Murray]] on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a \"master stroke.\" To placate Republicans, he nominated [[Patrick Henry]] and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose [[William Richardson Davie]] to replace him.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=523\u2013525}} Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams's cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593\u2013594}} To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months \u2013 March to September \u2013 of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the [[yellow fever]] epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=526\u2013529}} Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=304}} Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the president, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] to France. \"I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool,\" Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=530\u2013531}}\n\n===Fries's Rebellion===\n{{main|Fries's Rebellion}}\nTo pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the [[direct tax|Direct Tax]] of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from [[excise tax]]es and [[Tariffs in United States history|tariffs]]. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[land value tax]] of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran [[John Fries]], rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=696\u2013700}} The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.{{sfn|Diggins|2003|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nFries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=540\u2013541}} In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that \"it was impossible to commit a greater error.\"<ref name=\"Adams Pamphlet\">{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0110-0002#ARHN-01-25-02-0110-0002-fn-0166-ptr |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq.

Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and [[Samuel Dexter]] as Secretary of War.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=538\u2013539}}{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1028\u20131029}} In 1799, [[Napoleon]] took over as head of the French government in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] and declared the French Revolution over.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=534}} News of this event increased Adams's desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539\u2013540}} His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=395}} Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539\u2013540}}\n\nNapoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the [[Convention of 1800]], the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16\u201314 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance of 1778]] be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property.

The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.<ref name=\"Ferling, ch. 19\">Ferling, ch. 19.</ref>\n\nThe campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of \"all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion.\" They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored [[Sally Hemings|affairs]] with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=543\u2013545}} [[James T.

Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=536\u2013537}}\n\nOpposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=544}} Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams's character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=619\u2013620}} The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that \"the poor old man\" could do himself in without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=549}} On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams's policies and character. Hamilton denounced the \"precipitate nomination\" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the president's \"disgusting egotism\" and \"ungovernable temper.\" Adams, he concluded, was \"emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president.\"<ref name=\"Adams Pamphlet\"/> Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=320\u2013321}} The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams's already-likely defeat.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}}\n\nWhen the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory.

Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend [[First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's inauguration]].

At the time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be someone \"in the full vigor of middle age\" who could counter what might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams chose his Secretary of State John Marshall.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1063\u20131064}} He, along with Stoddert, was one of Adams's few trusted cabinet members, and was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White House.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=560}} Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court.

Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the \"Midnight Judges,\" just days before his term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the [[7th United States Congress|7th Congress]], with a solid Republican majority, approved the [[Judiciary Act of 1802]], abolishing the newly created courts.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=408\u2013410}}\n\n==Retirement==\n===Initial years===\nAdams resumed farming at [[Peacefield]] in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography.

John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=435}} During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] and [[Benjamin Rush]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=426}}\n\nAdams generally stayed quiet on public matters.

Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=586}} The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his \"partiality for monarchy\" and \"pride of talents and much ambition.\" A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=594\u2013596}} Adams did privately criticize the President over his [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]],<ref name=\"Adams 1808\"/> despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=598\u2013599}} John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since \"abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=599}}\n\nAfter Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the ''[[Boston Patriot (newspaper)|Boston Patriot]]'' newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and \"had gathered dust for eight years.\" Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|a duel with Aaron Burr]], Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429\u2013430}} Adams supported the [[War of 1812]].

Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter [[Mary Jefferson Eppes|Polly]], who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=431}}\n\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Portrait of John Adams - Samuel Finley Breese Morse - overall.jpg|thumb|right|John Adams, c. 1816, by [[Samuel Morse]] ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art|Brooklyn Museum]])|alt=An unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair, slightly pointing left.]]\n\nIn early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429\u2013430}} Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters \u2013 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=431\u2013432}}\n\nEarly on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=607}} Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that \"nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, June 27, 1813. Cappon p. 338.</ref> Adams made one more attempt, writing that \"You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.\"<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, July 15, 1813. Cappon p. 358.</ref> Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=608}}{{efn|The two men discussed \"natural aristocracy.\" Jefferson said, \"The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [aristocrats] into the offices of government?\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, October 28, 1813. Cappon, p. 388.</ref> Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, \"Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence.\" It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than wisdom and virtue. A good government had to account for that reality.<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, November 15, 1813. Cappon, p. 400.</ref>}}\n\nAs the two men became older, the letters grew fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=634}}\n\n===Last years and death===\nAbigail died of [[typhoid]] on October 28, 1818, at their Quincy home, Peacefield.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=437}} \n\nThe year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a [[1824 United States presidential election|four-way presidential contest]] which included John Quincy. The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] toured the country and met with Adams, who greatly enjoyed LaFayette's visit to Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=637}} Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency.

While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized [[Thomas Paine]]'s 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by [[John Locke]]. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had \"a better hand at pulling down than building.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=97}} He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were \"so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work.\"{{sfn|Foot|Kramnick|1987|p=11}} What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement.{{sfn|Gimbel|1956|p=21}} Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' and styled as \"a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend.\" Many historians agree that none of Adams's other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155\u2013157}}\n\nAdams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends \u2013 the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, \"There is no good government but what is [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]]. That the only valuable part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]] is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men.\" The treatise defended [[bicameralism]], for \"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual.\"<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], Vol. IV, p. 195, \"Thoughts on Government\"</ref> Adams suggested that there should be a [[separation of powers]] between the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[judicial]] and the [[legislative]] branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it \"should sacredly be confined\" to certain [[enumerated powers]]. ''Thoughts on Government'' was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that [[John Dickinson]]'s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155\u2013157}}\n\n===Massachusetts Constitution===\nAfter returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779\u20131780|Massachusetts Constitutional Convention]] with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and [[James Bowdoin]], to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive \u2013 though restrained by an executive council \u2013 with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to \"hold their offices during good behavior.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nThe Constitution affirmed the \"duty\" of the individual to worship the \"Supreme Being,\" and that he had the right to do so without molestation \"in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=222}} It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=272}} Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He believed that people \"in a State of Ignorance\" were more easily enslaved while those \"enlightened with knowledge\" would be better able to protect their liberties.{{sfn|Burns|2013|p=76}} Adams became one of the founders of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.{{sfn|Cochrane|1978|p=7}}\n\n===''Defence of the Constitutions''===\nAdams's preoccupation with political and governmental affairs \u2013 which caused considerable separation from his wife and children \u2013 had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: \"I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine.\"{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nWhile in London, Adams learned of a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] being planned to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In January 1787, he published a work entitled ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |title=John Adams: Defence of the Constitutions, 1787 |publisher=Constitution.org |access-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125085353/http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |archive-date=January 25, 2010  }}</ref> The pamphlet repudiated the views of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that \"the rich, the well-born and the able\" should be set apart from other men in a senate \u2013 that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams's ''Defence'' is described as an articulation of the theory of [[mixed government]]. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to [[Aristotle]], a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy \u2013 that is, the king, the nobles, and the people \u2013 was required to preserve order and liberty.{{sfn|Adams|1954|p=xvii}}\n\nHistorian [[Gordon S. Wood]] has maintained that Adams's political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of [[popular sovereignty]] was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.{{sfn|Wood|2006|pp=173\u2013202}} Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams's peculiar definition of the term \"republic,\" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=317}}\n\nOn [[separation of powers]], Adams wrote that, \"Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest.\"<ref name=\"Works of John Adams, IV:557\">Works of John Adams, IV:557</ref> This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, \"[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition,\" in [[Federalist No. 51]], explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution.<ref name=\"Works of John Adams, IV:557\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Madison |first=James|title=The Federalist No. 51 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Federalist_Papers/No._51&oldid=504230}}</ref> Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against \"aristocrats\" attempting to take it away.<ref name=\"Ralston\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/amer-enl/#SH3d |title=American Enlightenment Thought |last=Ralston |first=Shane J. |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref> On the government's role in education Adams stated that, \"The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.\"<ref>Adams, Letter to [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]], Vol. 9, p. 540.</ref>\n\nAdams first saw the new [[United States Constitution]] in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it \"with great satisfaction.\" Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without [[United States Senate|Senate]] approval and over the absence of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. \"Should not such a thing have preceded the model?\" he asked.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=379}}\n\n==Political philosophy and views==\n===Slavery===\nAdams never owned a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, \"I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap.\"<ref name=RJEvans>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=Letter to Robert J. Evans|date=June 8, 1819}}</ref> Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=77}} Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should \"sleep for a time.\" He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners.{{sfn|Wiencek|2004|p=215}} Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution.{{sfn|Moore|1866|pp=200\u2013203}} Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=26}}\n\n===Accusations of monarchism===\nThroughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions.<ref name=\"Mark O.

This portrait was the last made of Adams, done at the request of John Quincy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=638}}|alt=An elderly man sits in a red chair with his arms crossed, looking slightly left.]]\nMany of these attacks were scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to \"crown himself king\" and \"grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne.\"<ref name=\"John & Abigail Adams\"/> Peter Shaw has argued that: \"[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life.\"{{sfn|Shaw|1975|pp=230\u2013237}} In contrast to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:\n\n{{quote|If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse.{{sfn|Adams|2004|p=466}}}}\n\nAccording to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: [[political science|practical study]] of past and present governments, and [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11\u201314}} Adams's conclusion was that the great danger was that an [[oligarchy]] of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11\u201314}}<ref name=\"Ralston\"/>\n\n===Religious views===\n\nAdams was raised a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], since his ancestors were Puritans. According to biographer [[David McCullough]], \"as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that.\"{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=18}} In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=22}} He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett (1966) concludes that \"Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness\" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection.{{sfn|Everett|1966|pp=49\u201357}} Fielding (1940) argues that Adams's beliefs synthesized Puritan, [[deism|deist]], and [[humanism|humanist]] concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been [[revelation|revelatory]], but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.{{sfn|Fielding|1940|pp=33\u201346}}\n\nFrazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, \"Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence.&nbsp;... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation.\"<ref>Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 46.</ref> Frazer argues that Adams's \"theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism.\"<ref>Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 50.</ref> In 1796, Adams denounced [[Thomas Paine]]'s deistic criticisms of Christianity in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', saying, \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-03-02-0013-0002-0015 |title=July 26. 1796.

Wood]] (2017) writes, \"Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings.\"{{sfn|Wood|2017|p=16}}\n\nIn his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], rejecting the divinity of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=433\u2013434}} David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|his miracles]] as true.{{sfn|Holmes|2006|pp=73\u201378}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n{{see also|Bibliography of John Adams}}\nFranklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, \"He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses.\"{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=518}} Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and honorable career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}}{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=520}}\n\nHistorian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=647}} He was often described as \"prickly\", but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in the face of universal opposition.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: \"[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore.\"{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=57}} Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. \"Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right,\" he wrote.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=272}} His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=90\u201391}} Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/impact-and-legacy |title=John Adams: Impact and Legacy |last=Taylor |first=C.

The country tended further away from Adams's emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] and then [[Jacksonian democracy]] grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=4}} When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[William Henry Harrison]] was attacked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.{{sfn|Shafer|2016|pp=128\u2013129}} Adams was eventually subject to criticism from [[states' rights]] advocates. [[Edward A. Pollard]], a strong supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], singled out Adams, writing:\n\n{{quote|The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the supremacy of the \"National\" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment in each of the Middle States. The \"[[strict constructionism|strict constructionists]]\" of the Constitution were not slow in raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.{{sfn|Pollard|1862|p=12}}}}\n\nIn the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough argued that \"[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him.\" Todd Leopold of [[CNN]] wrote in 2001 that Adams is \"remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues.\"<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/06/07/david.mccullough/ |title=David McCullough brings 'John Adams' to life |last=Leopold |first=Todd |publisher=CNN |date=June 7, 2006 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> He has always been seen, Ferling says, as \"honest and dedicated\", but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=2\u20133}} Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as \"staunch, honest, stubborn and somewhat narrow.\"{{sfn|Chinard|1933|p=vi}} In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that \"Adams was his own worst enemy.\" He criticizes him for his \"pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity\", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published ''The Character of John Adams''. Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one \"perpetually at war with himself\", whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nIn 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, \"plays down or explains away\" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams's reputation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27maiert.html |title=Plain Speaking: In David McCullough's telling, the second president is reminiscent of the 33rd (Harry Truman) |last=Maier |first=Pauline |date=May 27, 2001 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> In 2008, a [[John Adams (miniseries)|miniseries]] was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring [[Paul Giamatti]] as Adams.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-giamatti13apr13-story.html |title=Paul Giamatti is so imperfect for the role |last=Lieberman |first=Paul |date=April 13, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In memoriam===\n{{main|List of memorials to John Adams}}\nAdams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items.<ref name=\"OLC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/adams.html |title=The John Adams Building |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adamscounty.us/Pages/County-Facts.aspx |title=County Facts |publisher=Adams County, PA |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/Historical/naming_mount_adams.shtml |title=Naming the Cascade Range Volcanoes Mount Adams, Washington |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> One example is the [[John Adams Building]] of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence Adams had signed into law.<ref name=\"OLC\"/> Unlike many other Founders, Adams does not have a monument dedicated to him in Washington, D.C.,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-doesnt-john-adams-have-a-memorial-in-washington/2011/06/30/AGTvmrtH_story.html |title=Why doesn't John Adams have a memorial in Washington? |last=Heffner |first=Alexander |date=July 1, 2011 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> although a family inclusive [[Adams Memorial]] was authorized in 2001 and awaits funding.

Between 2011\u20132018, the number of attendees was around 85,000, 75,000 of whom were paying visitors. In 2020, the festival is scheduled to take place from 30 July to 1 August.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe idea for Wacken Open Air was conceived in 1989 when Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner visited a restaurant together. Both lived in Wacken and were friends, Jensen played the electric bass with [[Rock music|Rock]] cover band Skyline. From its beginnings until 1992, the band was composed of Ines Jeske from [[Vaale]] (vocals), Thomas Jensen from Wacken (bass), Peter Huhn from Wacken (electric guitar), Dennis Harman from [[Itzehoe]] (keyboard), and Andreas G\u00f6ser from Wacken (drums). Skyline was one of the first regional Metal and Rock [[cover band]]s at that time. The band was regionally known, working its way from appearances in village pubs and gigs at biker meetings up to an appearance as supporting band of \"[[Extrabreit]]\". H\u00fcbner was a disc jockey with a focus on Rock music and Heavy Metal. Jensen and H\u00fcbner developed the idea to organise an [[open-air concert]] in a gravel pit in Wacken and persuaded Skyline drummer Andreas G\u00f6ser and J\u00f6rg Jensen, Thomas Jensen's brother, to help make it happen. Until then, the pit had already served as a meeting venue for up to 3,000 members of biker club 'No Mercys', it was therefore perfectly suited for their plans and also presented an opportunity to attract motorcycle fans. From the beginning, it was clear that the focus of the event would be on Rock and Metal and that, in contrast to other single-day festivals such as [[Monsters of Rock]] or Super Rock in [[Mannheim]], there would also be camping grounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=18\u201319}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|date=Spring 2013|title=Das W:O:A \u2013 Die Story in Zeitraffer|url=|journal=Wacken inside|volume=|pages=16\u201319|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Early years and initial development ===\n[[File:Wacken Promotion 1990.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Wacken Open Air in 1990]]\nThe first two-day festival took place in the gravel pit on 24 and 25 August 1990 and barely had 800 visitors. The performing bands all hailed from Germany, and apart from Skyline, bands like 5th Avenue, Motoslug, Sacred Season, Axe 'n Sex, and Wizzard played. The first festivals were organised privately, with the technology being built on a trailer borrowed from a local trucking company and the stage being a DIY construction.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt.|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=19\u201322}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years, too, most of the tasks were carried out by the small team. Until August 1994, for example, ticket orders were organised privately by Andy G\u00f6ser's mother Regina G\u00f6ser and security duties were performed by friendly motorcycle clubs up until 1996.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=22\u201324}}</ref> In 1991, the number of visitors increased to 1.300,<ref name=\":2\" /> and with Skyline returning, Bon Scott, an [[AC/DC]] cover band from [[Hamburg]], Gypsy Kyss, Kilgore, Life Artist, Ruby Red, and Shanghai'd Guts joined them on stage for an all-regional roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2014/main-history/history/woa-1991/bands/|title=Billing 1991|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> That same year, the iconic skull logo was designed by Mark Ramsauer after the basic shape had been determined by Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/schleswig-holstein/woa-2019-wikipedia-fakt-oder-fiktion-wacken-gruender-machen-faktencheck-id24948137.html|title=WOA 2019: Wikipedia Fakt oder Fiktion: Wacken-Gr\u00fcnder machen Faktencheck|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The cow skull refers to the venue, a meadow for cows, and to Jensen and H\u00fcbner as \"boys from the village\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhard.de/megazine/heftarchiv/online-megazine/kolumne/25-jahre-wacken.html|title=25 Jahre Wacken|last=Eckhorst|first=Tim|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the programme changed to include internationally renowned bands such as [[Blind Guardian]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] for the first time,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=24\u201326}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> and the number of bands rose to 26, listing bands from [[Sweden]], the [[United States|USA]], [[Ireland]], and [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2014/main-history/history/woa-1992/1/|title=Billing 1992|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The organisers used a professional stage with lighting and PA for the first time and were able to win cigarette brand Prince Denmark as a sponsor.<ref name=\":3\" /> That year, the Party Stage was set up in the DJ tent next to the main stage, where cover bands and fun projects were to perform exclusively. The additional post-concert costs for garbage disposal on the campground, where 2,500 paying guests and many more were present and celebrated, as well as the significantly oversized security, among other things, meant that the organisers recorded a loss of around 25,000 D-Mark that year.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith the reunion of the band [[Fates Warning]] at the festival in 1993, Wacken Open Air had a special feature and also made a name for itself in the following years with unusual band constellations and reunions. At the same time, [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]] and other well-known bands made for interesting appearances, which resulted in a new record attendance of 3,500 paying customers. Simultaneously, the team tried their hand at concert organisation and, under the moniker Stone Castle Promotion, held a [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] concert for 2,000 people in Flensburg which, unfortunately, could not cover its promotional costs. A show with [[Dio (band)|Dio]]/Freak of Nature became a disaster with only 167 tickets sold, and together with the Open Air, which again recorded a minus, the organisers incurred debts of around 350,000 D-Mark. As a result, J\u00f6rg Jensen and Andreas G\u00f6ser left the team; Holger H\u00fcbner and Thomas Jensen remained, as did J\u00f6rn-Ulf Goesmann for another two years, continuing to run the Wacken Open Air despite the debts for which their parents had provided guarantees. During the same year, Thomas Jensen's mother died and Holger H\u00fcbner had a serious accident \u2013 the year went down in Wacken history as the \"year of the plague\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=27\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn its fifth anniversary in 1994, the financial situation stabilised and the festival finally broke even. The line-up remained professional and featured many internationally known bands from the [[Metal scene]]. A total of 4,500 tickets were sold; on top of that, due to the rising costs of garbage disposal, tickets for the camping grounds had to be purchased separately, and pre-orders were rewarded with a free T-shirt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=30\u201331}}</ref> Also in 1995, income and expenses evened out thanks to the commitment of bands such as [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]], [[D.A.D.

But even with roughly 5,000 attendees, the festival didn't turn a profit.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> However, for the first time, national media became aware of Wacken Open Air, especially [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine, as well as the newly founded TV station [[VIVA Germany|VIVA]] with its Heavy Metal programme ''Metalla''.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== First achievements and growth ===\nTicket sales for the 1996 festival again started sluggishly, despite a headliner like [[Kreator]] and numerous internationally renowned bands such as [[The Exploited]], [[Gorefest]], and [[Crematory (band)|Crematory]]. Management tried to prevent another loss by securing more acts and finally managed to get [[B\u00f6hse Onkelz]] to perform. The engagement of the controversial band also led to criticism, and some bands cancelled their gig in Wacken that year. Cologne band [[Brings]] called off their gig on short notice and offered to refund their fans\u2019 ticket prices.<ref>\u201eNews\" from Hamburger Abendblatt, 6. August 1996, p. 12</ref>\n\nAs a result of many visitors flooding the village in 1996, the inhabitants of Wacken voiced their concern over an event of this size being held in the local gravel pit. Uwe Trede offered to relocate the festival site to his own property and the areas previously used as campgrounds and took care of the acquisition of additional land. The organisational team grew to include Thomas Hess as production manager, who had previously been active as tour manager for Die B\u00f6hsen Onkelz, as well as Sheree Hesse for catering to the artists and VIPs. With the W.E.T.-Stage, a third stage was set up in 1997. The \"Wacken Evolution Tent\" was to be made available primarily to newcomers and bands without record deals. That year, the number of visitors reached 10,000 for the first time, with [[Rockbitch]]'s erotic stage show causing a scene.<ref>Andreas Sch\u00f6we: ''Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt''. H\u00f6fen 2012, p. 35\u201337</ref>\n\n=== Further development of the festival ===\n[[File:WackenOpenAir.jpg|thumb|W:O:A 2005 was attended by 40,000 people]]\nOver the years, the size of Wacken Open Air has grown continuously, and now dozens of bands and tens of thousands of visitors flock to the festival. Even though the organisers said in 2006 that 62,500 visitors were \"the limit of what is possible\",<ref>press conference in 2006 (source needed)</ref> changes were made to the structure of the festival grounds the following year by allocating a larger area to the \"Party Stage\". In addition, tickets could no longer be purchased directly on the festival grounds to reduce the number of spontaneous or ticketless visitors. In 2007 and 2008, the festival had already sold out as a result of advance ticket sales; for W:O:A 2009, tickets had even sold out by the end of 2008. The tickets for 2010, too, sold out months in advance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2010/main-news/news/ansicht/article/wahnsinn-wacken-im-5-jahr-hintereinander-ausverkauft-resttickets-bei-unseren-buspartnern-erhaeltli/|title=News on wacken.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile the festival originally only lasted two days, the performances have been lasting from Thursday to Saturday, i.e. three days, for some years. Thursday became a \"Night to Remember\", with mainly \"classical\" Heavy Metal bands appearing, such as the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] in 2006. On the actual Party Stage, younger and more modern bands play as a contrast to the \"Night to Remember\". In addition, the event is accompanied by a rich complementary programme; in addition to a merchant area \u2013 obligatory for music festivals \u2013 a beer garden has been operating since 2000, in which the [[Wacken Firefighters]]' marching band opens the festival before its official start. On Thursday in 2007, the \"Hellfest Stage\" was initiated. Since 2009, there has been a \"Medieval Stage\", where mainly [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Folk metal|Folk Metal]] bands play.\n\nThe fact that many well-known bands, including the Scorpions, [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Slayer]], and [[Helloween]], have recorded live [[DVD]]s at Wacken, shows how esteemed the Open Air has since become. Ahead of their farewell tour in 2004, Die B\u00f6hsen Onkelz also performed an extended set at W:O:A.\n\nSince 2002, the so-called \"Metal Train\" has been travelling from [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] to Wacken and back before and after the festival to bring fans to the Northern German village and provide a matching entertainment programme. Bus tours from [[Scandinavia]]n countries, especially [[Sweden]], but also from [[Austria]], are organised each year and used by several hundred fans.\n\nThe \"W:O:A Soccercup\" has been taking place annually since 2002. This football tournament, which started with nine teams and takes place on Wednesdays, has grown over the years and has been held in World Cup mode with 32 teams since 2007 (a one-off event in 2011 featured 36 teams). The international teams register in advance and are composed of festival visitors. For the tournament's 15th anniversary in 2016, a band was featured and took part for the first time: [[Serum 114]] formed a team with several fans and were able to win the tournament. Although it is meant to be a fun tournament, in which creative outfits and names take precedence over athletic performance, the award ceremony after the tournament has been held on one of the stages since 2013 and prices can be won.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210920/http://neu.woa-soccercup.de/|title=W:O:A Soccercup|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the \"Full Metal Church\" took place in Wacken for the first time. Marking the local church's 150th anniversary, the team, together with the parish, organised a concert by the band [[Faun (band)|Faun]], which was framed by two readings and sermons by \"[[Volxbibel]]\" author Martin Dreyer. Both the concert and the services were completely overcrowded by festival visitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_kAR2EWlgk|title=Full Metal Church|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Present ===\n[[File:Alice Cooper - Wacken Open Air 2017 03.jpg|left|thumb|Alice Cooper at Wacken Open Air 2017]]\nThe festival is one of the Metal scene's highlights of the year. Nowadays, about a third of the visitors, some of whom arrive quite some time before the official start of the festival, and the majority of the bands come from abroad. According to the organisers, 2018 saw visitors from more than 80 nations attending the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/die-ersten-bands-fuer-das-wacken-open-air-2019/|title=Die ersten Bands f\u00fcr das Wacken Open Air 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe number of participants increased to 75,000 in 2008 and included 65,000 paying guests. In 2008, the festival sold out twice ( W:O:A 2008 in spring and W:O:A 2009 on 31 December 2008).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2010/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/wahnsinn-wacken-sold-out/|title=Wahnsinn Wacken \u2013 Sold Out!!!|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAs is common with festivals of this size, Wacken Open Air received criticism for its hygienic conditions, prices, security personnel, as well as for the overcrowding and commercial orientation of the event. These points of criticism were addressed by making further substantial investments in the festival's fixed and mobile infrastructure. In 2008, the organisers also contributed 1,000,000 Euros to the expansion of Wacken's local outdoor swimming pool in order to make the festival even more attractive to the residents and visitors of the town.<ref>Information provided by mayor Axel Kunkel</ref>\n\nSince 2006, the festival has been running an [[Internet radio|online radio]] station called [[Wacken Radio]], which broadcasts Metal music around the clock. It is being produced in cooperation with [[RauteMusik.FM|RauteMusik]] as of February 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rautemusik.fm/wackenradio/|title=Wacken Metal Radio \u2013 Heavy Metal Radio \u2013 Metalcore & Grindcore \u2013 RauteMusik.FM Internetradio|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Wikipedians at WOA 2011.JPG|thumb|Attendees at Wacken Open Air 2011]]\nFor the 23rd edition of Wacken Open Air, the sale of an \"X-Mas Package\" started on Monday, 8 August 2011, shortly after the end of that year's festival, and was sold out within 45 minutes. The event sold out ten times in a row between 2006 and 2015.

Booking office Metaltix\u2019 servers were highly busy. In the minutes before the start of the pre-sale, the pages were no longer accessible; after that, [[Network traffic|data traffic]] had to be limited by wait lists.\n\nPrices for the festival have risen and are currently at a level similar to other major Rock festivals, such as [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring]] and [[Hurricane Festival]]. After several years of success in which the festival sold out within hours, the first 60,000 tickets for the 2017 festival were sold in mid-2016. 55,000 tickets were sold within the first hour. By the end of April 2017, the festival was almost sold out except for a few remaining tickets. The price for the festival ticket was 220 Euros, but there was no fee for early arrival campers, who often set up their elaborately designed accommodations before the festival begins \u2013 partly to get the best spots near the festival grounds. In addition, all toilets and showers were free in 2017.\n\nThe festival sold out within a few days each in 2014\u20132016. However, the last tickets for the 2017 festival were sold after 309 days, a mere 2 months before the start of the festival, even though only 10,000 tickets remained after the first day of sales. This was a matter of speculation at first, and reasons such as the changed security situation or the price development were taken into account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/themen/wacken-open-air/holger-huebner-darum-ist-das-woa-2017-noch-nicht-ausverkauft-id14616776.html|title=Holger H\u00fcbner: Darum ist das WOA 2017 noch nicht ausverkauft|last=|first=|date=20 August 2016|website=SHZ.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> Regardless of that, the festival sold out for the 13th time in a row in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/themen/wacken-open-air/woa-ist-ausverkauft-alle-75-000-tickets-sind-weg-id17048861.html|title=WOA ist ausverkauft \u2013 alle 75.000 Tickets sind weg|last=|first=|date=13 June 2017|website=SHZ.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 April 2018 Thomas Hess, the festival's longtime production (and former security) director, passed away. He had joined festival management in 1996 as a former tour manager of B\u00f6hse Onkelz and was considered one of the most important leading figures for the festival, along with the remaining founders and the Trede family, who organise the camping areas and the camping supervisors as subcontractors.

The name is derived from the direct translation of \"Steinburg\" from the district of [[Steinburg]], to which Wacken belongs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Stone Castle remained the company's name until 1996. Up until 2014, the headquarters were located in [[D\u00f6rpstedt|D\u00f6rpstedt (Schleswig-Flensburg district)]] and then moved to Wacken. The company's name has been ''ICS'' (International Concert Service) GmbH since 1999. The company owns the label ''Wacken Records'' and the [[Mail order|mailorder]] Metaltix, among others.\n\nA daily festival newspaper has been available since 2007, reporting on what's happening on the festival grounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Metall macht Musik|last=Eckhorst|first=Tim|publisher=TheNextArt Verlag|year=2008|isbn=978-3-939400-18-9|location=|pages=83}}</ref> The Thursday edition is also included free of charge with all newspapers published by [[Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag]].\n\nIn 2014, the online radio station RauteMusik took over production of the official Wacken radio. Wacken Radio has its own container on the festival grounds every year, where it reports live.\n\nUp until a few years ago, Wacken's official town signs were either replaced by plastic signs spelling Heavy Metal Town during W:O:A or bolted more tightly because they were often stolen as souvenirs. Some shops are now selling black cotton bags with the Wacken town sign on one side and the words \"This town sign I may keep\" on the other.\n\nAn action for exceeding the maximum noise limit, brought before the Administrative Court of Schleswig by residents of Wacken, ended in January 2013 with an out-of-court settlement. Now, if the average noise level of the festival exceeds 70&nbsp;dB, the organisers pay 1,000 Euros to the community, which donates the money to charitable causes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/musik-festival-wacken-darf-laut-bleiben-a-879534.html|title=Anwohner bes\u00e4nftigt: Wacken darf weiter rocken|last=|first=|date=|website=Spiegel Online|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\nThe site covers more than 240 [[hectare]]s, which are divided by more than 45 kilometres of fence. The inner area, including the main stage, has a size of 43,000 [[square metre]]s. More than 1,300 toilets and almost 500 showers are available for the 75,000 paying attendees. 2,200 trucks with equipment are needed for the entire festival. Stage construction and dismantling usually take 7 days and 5 days respectively. For this, 75 trucks of stage equipment (1,000 tons), 10 trucks of sound equipment and 27 trucks of lighting equipment are used.<ref name=\":5\">W:O:A press kit 2018</ref>\n\nSince 2014, the [[Electricity|electric]] output has amounted to 12 megawatts, roughly matching the needs of a small town counting 70,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wacken.shz.de/woa2014/|title=Wacken - 25 Jahre Metal-Mythos|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.saz.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> In addition, 40 diesel-fuelled [[Emergency power system|emergency power generators]] are required. 25 electricians are responsible for the power supply.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n600,000 Euros were spent on the construction of sewage systems and the improvement of power supply on the festival grounds. At the same time, 700,000 Euros worth of drains were installed in front of the stages in order to improve the drainage of water masses during heavy rains. The main paths were also paved with 10&nbsp;km of mobile roads to facilitate access for rescue vehicles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nA total of approximately 5,000 employees work for the festival, including 1,800 security staff members, 150 cleaners, 70 construction and dismantling assistants, as well as 400 police officers, 250 firefighters, 900 paramedics, and six emergency doctors.\n\nIn 2017, a beer pipeline measuring one kilometer to supply ten dispensing systems was used for the first time.

The most important ones are the Faster and the Harder Stage, which are designed as connected twin stages and have a shared sound and lighting system. Together with the slightly smaller Louder Stage, these two stages make up the Infield, or The Holy Ground. All three stages are also equipped with [[video wall]]s to allow visibility of the performers even from remote positions.\n\nUp until 2016, these three stages were called Black Stage, True Metal Stage, and Party Stage. After Wacken 2016, visitors were encouraged to suggest new names. From these suggestions, the best ideas were to be put up to a vote in a survey. Instead, however,\u00a0 the slogan \"Faster - Harder - Louder\" became the inspiration for the names and the three stages were renamed accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/mehr-sound-und-neue-namen-die-buehnen-im-infield/|title=Mehr Sound und neue Namen \u2013 die B\u00fchnen im Infield!|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTwo more twin stages, the W.E.T. Stage (Wacken Evolution Tent) and the Headbanger Stage, are located inside a big tent called Bullhead City Circus. The Metal Battle takes place on these stages on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by regular band appearances on the days after.\n\nWhile the large stages and tent stages are open to all genres, the remaining stages are dedicated to specific themes. The Wackinger Stage is located in the medieval area of the festival and is played primarily by bands from Folk, Pagan and Medieval genres, while the Wasteland Stage, which was established in 2014, is geared towards music with an apocalyptic touch. The Beergarden Stage is modelled after typical folk festival stages, but also accommodates permanent Wacken guests such as the Wacken Firefighters and [[Mambo Kurt]].\n\n=== Event area ===\n[[File:Wastelander \u2013 Wacken Open Air 2014 05.jpg|thumb|Wasteland \u2013 apocalypse at Wacken Open Air 2014]]\nWacken Open Air's event area is divided into several structurally separated sections. Since 2014, only one major security check is performed upon entering the grounds, after that, only the festival wristbands are checked.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/ein-vierteljahrhundert-wacken-open-air-ist-history/|title=Ein Vierteljahrhundert Wacken Open Air ist History!!!|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nSpecial features of the W:O:A include the Wackinger area, which resembles a medieval market and contains specialty food and beverage stalls as well as the Wackinger Stage, where matching music is played. Various walking acts also entertain the audience. This area borders on the Wasteland designed by the [[Wasteland Warriors]], where a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world and stage (Wastelandstage) styled in homage to the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]-franchise is set up.\n\nThe area in front of the main stages comprises both the [[Bavaria]]n [[beer garden]] and a large shopping mile called Metal Markt. There are also various food stalls, the Wacken Foundation Camp, ATMs, and the Movie Field, where Heavy Metal [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and [[feature film]]s are screened.\n\nThe most important stages, the focal point of the festival, are located in the so-called Infield, which can be reached only via the Center. In addition to these stages, it also hosts food and beverage stalls.\n\n=== Camping grounds ===\n[[File:Festivalgel\u00e4nde Wasteland - Wacken Open Air 2016-AL0321.jpg|thumb|Wasteland festival grounds at Wacken Open Air 2016]]\nAs Wacken Open Air only sells 3-day tickets, the majority of visitors spend the entire festival on-site. As a result, most of the more than 240 hectares of the festival site are designated camping areas. Camping opens on Monday and has been included in the ticket price since 2017. However, in the years before, an extra fee was charged for arrival before Wednesday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/infos-zum-vorverkauf-fuer-das-woa-2017/|title=Infos zum Vorverkauf f\u00fcr das W:O:A 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe campsite is equipped with showers, flushing toilets, [[portable toilet]]s, [[drinking fountain]]s, small supermarkets, food stalls, and information boards, and is continuously patrolled by the police, fire brigade, and security services. A garbage collection service collects full garbage bags on the premises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2015/main-news/news/news-suche/suche-ansicht/article/metal4nature-2014-9413/|title=Metal4nature|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor orientation, the individual sites called Campgrounds are marked with code letters. Campgrounds A and B are reserved for visitors arriving without a car, while Campgrounds Y and R are intended for campers and other heavy-duty vehicles. Y offers the possibility to rent entire caravans, tents or to get a power supply for your own [[Caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]]. At Campground U, large groups of 50 people or more can reserve a larger area free of charge.\n\nSince the large crowds lead to a bottleneck situation in terms of mobile service, some providers now set up portable [[base station]]s for [[GSM]], [[UMTS]], and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]+ during the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vodafone.de/featured/?vf_origin_url=music/wacken-nature-one-und-co-vodafone-ruestet-sein-netz-fuer-den-festivalsommer/|title=Wacken, Nature One und Co. \u2013 Vodafone r\u00fcstet sein Netz f\u00fcr den Festivalsommer|last=|first=|date=|website=vodafone.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical services ===\nA festival of this size needs capable medical services, which here are called the Wacken Rescue Squad. Every year, hundreds of helpers from various relief organisations from all over Germany arrive before the festival to prepare the medical camp and care for people in need during the event. The medical service is managed by the local [[German Red Cross|DRK]] association in [[Kaltenkirchen]].\n\nThe visiting and local relief organisations provide vehicles and material during the course of the festival. These include ambulances and radios for communication in particular. Due to the road conditions, quads and foot patrols are often used in Wacken, especially in the vicinity of the medical centre. In addition to the medical service, which counts approx. 270 people at peak times, the rescue service cooperation Schleswig-Holstein has more than ten emergency vehicles (ambulances and mobile intensive care units) on site while coordinating the overall [[emergency management]].\n\nIn 2013, around 3,300 people received medical care from approximately 500 paramedics.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ph/20130804124442/http://www.ndr.de/unterhaltung/events/wacken/woa_2013/wacken2849.html|title=Wacken-Fans machen sich auf den Heimweg|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Crime and accidents ===\nDespite the size of the festival, no serious security problems have been encountered so far.

During Metal Battle, newcomer bands compete against each other in national qualifiers and finals; the winner of each country then competes against the other finalists in the grand final at Wacken Open Air.\n\nAn international jury selects the competition's best bands. In earlier years, winners of the competition were offered a record deal, whereas nowadays, the five best bands receive cash or material prices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-battle.com/about/|title=Metal Battle|last=|first=|date=|website=Metal Battle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Wacken Foundation ===\nThe [[Wacken Foundation]] was founded in 2009 by the festival's organisers and serves as a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|charitable foundation]]. Its objective is to support young bands from the Heavy Metal genre.\n\nSponsorship is granted to specific projects such as the production of a [[Compact disc|CD]] or the realisation of a tour. In addition, the Wacken Foundation provides information about its projects at many [[Europe]]an festivals each summer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wacken-foundation.com/home/|title=Wacken Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=Wacken Foundation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> Since the 2017/2018 season, the Wacken Foundation's lettering can be found on the jerseys of German 3rd league club [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena]]. This was facilitated by jersey sponsors [[Heaven Shall Burn]], whose [[logo]] has been moved to the jersey's sleeve for this cause. Part of the proceeds from the jersey's sale is donated to the foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/carl-zeiss-jena-wacken-sponsor-trikotsponsor-100.html|title=Carl Zeiss Jena l\u00e4uft mit Wacken auf der Brust auf|last=|first=|date=|website=mdr.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Wacken Music Camp ===\n2014 saw Wacken Music Camp take place for the first time. One week after the festival ended, young people from all over Germany were invited to write and play their own songs under the guidance of professional musicians. They were accommodated in the so-called Kuhle, the site of the first Wacken Open Air.\n\n=== Blood donations ===\nThe organisers regularly call for [[blood donation]]s with the whole festival team. Blood is donated at the Itzehoe Clinic and the entire wing is decorated in W:O:A style, while Heavy Metal is blasted through the speakers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/lokales/norddeutsche-rundschau/wacken-metal-fans-lassen-sich-anzapfen-id6834671.html|title=Wacken: Metal-Fans lassen sich anzapfen|last=|first=|date=14 June 2014|website=shz.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== DKMS typing campaign ===\nSince W:O:A 2014, visitors and musicians have been encouraged to have their [[bone marrow]] typed for donation by the [[DKMS|German Bone Marrow Donor Database]].

The festival's team helps out with logistics for the event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2015/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/stark-gegen-krebs-kooperation-vom-wacken-open-air-mit-der-wattoluempiade-9322/|title=Stark gegen Krebs|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Network \u2013 W:O:A as a brand ==\n[[File:Wacken 2011 Impression 08.JPG|thumb|Tower with Wacken symbol, Wacken Open Air 2011]]\nIn addition to the festival itself, there are numerous other events planned and carried out by the organisers. A wide range of [[merchandising]] has also been developed over the years. In addition to T-shirts and a comprehensive range of CDs and DVDs, the festival also has accompanying [[print media]]. The ''W:O:A History Book'' contains the open-air's history up until 2005. The book Die Wahrheit \u00fcber Wacken (\"The truth about Wacken\", Oidium Verlag 2005, new edition published at Verlag Andreas Reiffer 2011) provides a more humorous account of the festival. It was written by satirist Till Burgw\u00e4chter in collaboration with comic artist Jan Oidium and is also available as an audio book comprising three CDs. The publication of a Metal cookbook shows how far merchandising has come. However, the mounting range of merchandising has led to growing criticism, as some consider it to be purely profit-oriented. The increasing coverage of the festival, especially in the wake of the documentary [[Full Metal Village]], is perceived by the traditional Metal scene as \"selling out\".\n\nIn 2005, Wacken Premium [[Pilsner]] was offered as the festival's \"own\" beer for the first time. It was produced in the Bavarian [[brewery]] Maximiliansbrauerei in [[Chieming]]. At W:O:A 2006 and 2007, the beer was available as well, this time produced in 0.5-litre bottles by the [[Flensburger Brauerei|Flensburger]] brewery. The large number of glass shards later forced the organisers to switch to 0.5-litre cans.\n\nAs a [[motto]], the phrase \"See you in Wacken - Rain or Shine\" has established itself alongside \"Faster, Harder, Louder\". Additionally, the festival features the sentence \"Louder Than Hell\" in its advertising.\n\n=== Full Metal Cruise ===\n[[Cruise ship|Cruises]] with Heavy Metal bands on board under the name [[Full Metal Cruise]] have been organised within Europe since 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamburg.de/kreuzfahrtschiffe/3500106/full-metal-cruise/|title=Full Metal Cruise: Heavy Metal auf hoher See|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Hamburg Metal Dayz ===\nThe indoor festival [[Hamburg Metal Dayz]] takes place at the same time as the [[Reeperbahn]]-Festival and is considered a get-together for the scene. In addition to concerts, there are panels with musicians, managers, and other Metal experts, as well as workshops and a question and answer session with the W:O:A organisers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hh-mittendrin.de/2014/09/hamburg-metal-dayz-gepflegter-krach-in-der-markthalle/|title=Hamburg Metal Dayz \u2013 gepflegter Krach in der Markthalle|last=|first=|date=23 September 2014|website=hh-mittendrin.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Wacken Roadshow ===\n[[File:Grailknights \u2013 Wacken Roadshow 2014 01.jpg|thumb|[[Grailknights]] at Wacken Roadshow 2014]]\nFor the Wacken Roadshow, several bands tour Europe under the banner of Wacken Open Air.

For five years, regional, national and international Metal bands like De la Cruz, 5th Avenue, and King K\u00f8ng played at Knust every Monday. After a break of almost 20 years, Metal Monday was revived by the Wacken Open Air organisers in 2014 in cooperation with the Knust, Seaside Touring, All Access, and Hamburg Konzerte. Metal, Rock, and Folkrock bands now perform once a month, following the motto \"three bands - small entrance fee\". In addition to regional bands, international newcomers are always invited.\n\n=== Zum Wackinger ===\n[[File:Martin Semmelrogge - Zum Wackinger - Wacken Winter Nights 2017 08.jpg|thumb|Reading with [[Martin Semmelrogge]] at Zum Wackinger 2017]]\nThe former country-style restaurant ''Zur Post'' in Wacken, built in 1919, has been the hub of the village and the surrounding communities for decades. It was here that bartenders Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner conceived the idea for today's Wacken Open Air. Today, it is used to accommodate staff and to serve other business purposes. A series of events called \"Zum Wackinger\" sees artists from music, comedy, and entertainment perform regularly. Since 2016, a two-day medieval feast with jugglers and bards takes place here.<ref>press kit ICS Network, ''Zum Wackinger'', September 2016 (p. 37)</ref>\n\n=== Metal Church ===\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Village Church in Wacken belongs to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] congregation of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in [[Northern Germany]]. For Wacken Open Air and Wacken Winter Nights, it is turned into the ''Metal Church''. During said festivals, the ''Metal Service'' is held here and bands from the Folk and Medieval scene perform in the church.\n\n=== Wacken Winter Nights ===\n[[File:Dunkelsch\u00f6n - Metal Church - Wacken Winter Nights 2017 01.jpg|thumb|[[Dunkelsch\u00f6n]] at Metal Church during Wacken Winter Nights]]\nWacken Winter Nights (WWN), a three-day Folk and Medieval open-air festival, took place for the first time in February 2017 at temperatures of -2 to -6 degrees Celsius in Wacken.

The first documentary, [[Metalheads - The Official Documentary]], was produced in 1999 on the occasion of the festival's 10th anniversary and was released on [[VHS]] by [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] in 2000. The film team lived on the festival grounds for ten days prior to the actual start of the festival and documented the work of construction workers, farmers such as Uwe Trede, villagers, fans and organisers. Although the film shows excerpts from performances by some of the bands and interviews with the artists, it is more of a behind-the-scenes documentary. The film was produced with the simplest means, including a professional [[8 mm video format|Hi8]] and a [[DV|Mini-DV]] camera and a team of three, and was regarded by the organisers as a trial run on the subject of film. According to the organisers, a total of 10,000 copies were made and sold. The film ''Nordland'' was shot for the 15th edition of W:O:A, but was only used for internal promotion. Both films were made by Thomas Greiner.\n\nThe documentary [[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey|Metal - A Headbanger's Journey]] by [[Sam Dunn]] (2005) features Wacken Open Air. The festival is described as a [[Mecca]] of Heavy Metal. The film [[Full Metal Village]] by director [[Cho Sung-hyung|Cho Sung-Hyung]], made in 2005 and 2006, portrays the people of Wacken dealing with the festival. In 2006, she was awarded the main award of the [[Hessischer Filmpreis]] and the [[Schleswig-Holstein Filmpreis]] for best documentary. Full Metal Village was the first documentary ever to win the [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] Award for young filmmakers in 2007. [[WDR Fernsehen|WDR]]-[[Rockpalast]] profiled the festival in 2006,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/rockpalast/events/wacken-nullsechs-uebersicht-100.html|title=Wacken Open Air 2006|last=|first=|date=|website=wdr.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/rockpalast/events/wacken-sieben-uebersicht-100.html|title=Wacken Open Air 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=wdr.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> and 2009<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/rockpalast/events/wacken-neun-uebersicht-100.html|title=Wacken Open Air 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=wdr.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> with two-hour documentaries.

However, there has been criticism of the fact that the Wacken Firefighters have been featured too prominently. The three Rockpalast documentaries focus on interviews with the musicians and the performances of the bands.\n\nAnother perspective is offered by the low-budget production ''Metaller die auf Br\u00fcste starren'' (\"The Metalheads Who Stare At Breasts\", title based on [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare At Goats]]), which five festival attendees shot during their stay at Wacken. \"Offener Kanal Bad Offenbach\" is listed as its official producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.okbo.de/|title=OKBO \u2013 Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> The film shows the festival from the filmmakers\u2019 (subjective) point of view and comments on the events in the style of [[New Journalism]]. In contrast to other documentaries, this one focuses on the fans. Whether it's a documentary in the true sense of the word or whether the film is just entertainment remains controversial. The filmmakers themselves avoid this question and classify their work as a \"trash documentary\". The film premiered on 5 May 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.programmkino.de/content/links.php?id=1516|title=Metaller die auf Br\u00fcste starren|last=|first=|date=|website=programmkino.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nSchleswig-Holstein's Prime Minister [[Peter Harry Carstensen]] ([[CDU/CSU|CDU]]) commented on the opening of W:O:A 2009: \"I don't come here to listen to the music, but I do identify with the festival\".<ref>o.

Almost all styles of [[hard rock]] and metal are represented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disctopia.de/live-and-ontour/metal-festivals-in-deutschland-osterreich-schweiz/|title=Metal Festival Landkarte 2015 f\u00fcr Deutschland & \u00d6sterreich {{!}} Disctopia Metal Webzine|language=de-DE|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> It is now one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world and one of the largest open-air festivals in Germany. Between 2011-2018, the number of attendees was around 85,000, 75,000 of whom were paying visitors. In 2020, the festival is scheduled to take place from 30 July to 1 August.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe idea for Wacken Open Air was conceived in 1989 when Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner visited a restaurant together. Both lived in Wacken and were friends, Jensen played the electric bass with [[Rock music|Rock]] cover band Skyline. From its beginnings until 1992, the band was composed of Ines Jeske from [[Vaale]] (vocals), Thomas Jensen from Wacken (bass), Peter Huhn from Wacken (electric guitar), Dennis Harman from [[Itzehoe]] (keyboard), and Andreas G\u00f6ser from Wacken (drums). Skyline was one of the first regional Metal and Rock [[cover band]]s at that time. The band was regionally known, working its way from appearances in village pubs and gigs at biker meetings up to an appearance as supporting band of \"[[Extrabreit]]\". H\u00fcbner was a disc jockey with a focus on Rock music and Heavy Metal. Jensen and H\u00fcbner developed the idea to organise an [[open-air concert]] in a gravel pit in Wacken and persuaded Skyline drummer Andreas G\u00f6ser and J\u00f6rg Jensen, Thomas Jensen's brother, to help make it happen. Until then, the pit had already served as a meeting venue for up to 3,000 members of biker club 'No Mercys', it was therefore perfectly suited for their plans and also presented an opportunity to attract motorcycle fans. From the beginning, it was clear that the focus of the event would be on Rock and Metal and that, in contrast to other single-day festivals such as [[Monsters of Rock]] or Super Rock in [[Mannheim]], there would also be camping grounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=18\u201319}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|date=Spring 2013|title=Das W:O:A \u2013 Die Story in Zeitraffer|url=|journal=Wacken inside|volume=|pages=16\u201319|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Early years and initial development ===\n[[File:Wacken Promotion 1990.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Wacken Open Air in 1990]]\nThe first two-day festival took place in the gravel pit on 24 and 25 August 1990 and barely had 800 visitors. The performing bands all hailed from Germany, and apart from Skyline, bands like 5th Avenue, Motoslug, Sacred Season, Axe 'n Sex, and Wizzard played. The first festivals were organised privately, with the technology being built on a trailer borrowed from a local trucking company and the stage being a DIY construction.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt.|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=19\u201322}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years, too, most of the tasks were carried out by the small team. Until August 1994, for example, ticket orders were organised privately by Andy G\u00f6ser's mother Regina G\u00f6ser and security duties were performed by friendly motorcycle clubs up until 1996.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=22\u201324}}</ref> In 1991, the number of visitors increased to 1.300,<ref name=\":2\" /> and with Skyline returning, Bon Scott, an [[AC/DC]] cover band from [[Hamburg]], Gypsy Kyss, Kilgore, Life Artist, Ruby Red, and Shanghai'd Guts joined them on stage for an all-regional roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2014/main-history/history/woa-1991/bands/|title=Billing 1991|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> That same year, the iconic skull logo was designed by Mark Ramsauer after the basic shape had been determined by Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/schleswig-holstein/woa-2019-wikipedia-fakt-oder-fiktion-wacken-gruender-machen-faktencheck-id24948137.html|title=WOA 2019: Wikipedia Fakt oder Fiktion: Wacken-Gr\u00fcnder machen Faktencheck|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The cow skull refers to the venue, a meadow for cows, and to Jensen and H\u00fcbner as \"boys from the village\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhard.de/megazine/heftarchiv/online-megazine/kolumne/25-jahre-wacken.html|title=25 Jahre Wacken|last=Eckhorst|first=Tim|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the programme changed to include internationally renowned bands such as [[Blind Guardian]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] for the first time,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=24\u201326}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> and the number of bands rose to 26, listing bands from [[Sweden]], the [[United States|USA]], [[Ireland]], and [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2014/main-history/history/woa-1992/1/|title=Billing 1992|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The organisers used a professional stage with lighting and PA for the first time and were able to win cigarette brand Prince Denmark as a sponsor.<ref name=\":3\" /> That year, the Party Stage was set up in the DJ tent next to the main stage, where cover bands and fun projects were to perform exclusively. The additional post-concert costs for garbage disposal on the campground, where 2,500 paying guests and many more were present and celebrated, as well as the significantly oversized security, among other things, meant that the organisers recorded a loss of around 25,000 D-Mark that year.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith the reunion of the band [[Fates Warning]] at the festival in 1993, Wacken Open Air had a special feature and also made a name for itself in the following years with unusual band constellations and reunions. At the same time, [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]] and other well-known bands made for interesting appearances, which resulted in a new record attendance of 3,500 paying customers. Simultaneously, the team tried their hand at concert organisation and, under the moniker Stone Castle Promotion, held a [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] concert for 2,000 people in Flensburg which, unfortunately, could not cover its promotional costs. A show with [[Dio (band)|Dio]]/Freak of Nature became a disaster with only 167 tickets sold, and together with the Open Air, which again recorded a minus, the organisers incurred debts of around 350,000 D-Mark. As a result, J\u00f6rg Jensen and Andreas G\u00f6ser left the team; Holger H\u00fcbner and Thomas Jensen remained, as did J\u00f6rn-Ulf Goesmann for another two years, continuing to run the Wacken Open Air despite the debts for which their parents had provided guarantees. During the same year, Thomas Jensen's mother died and Holger H\u00fcbner had a serious accident \u2013 the year went down in Wacken history as the \"year of the plague\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=27\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn its fifth anniversary in 1994, the financial situation stabilised and the festival finally broke even. The line-up remained professional and featured many internationally known bands from the [[Metal scene]]. A total of 4,500 tickets were sold; on top of that, due to the rising costs of garbage disposal, tickets for the camping grounds had to be purchased separately, and pre-orders were rewarded with a free T-shirt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=30\u201331}}</ref> Also in 1995, income and expenses evened out thanks to the commitment of bands such as [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]], [[D.A.D. (band)|D-A-D]], the [[Pretty Maids]], and [[Angra (band)|Angra]]. But even with roughly 5,000 attendees, the festival didn\u2019t turn a profit.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt|last=Sch\u00f6we|first=Andreas|publisher=H\u00f6fen|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> However, for the first time, national media became aware of Wacken Open Air, especially [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine, as well as the newly founded TV station [[VIVA Germany|VIVA]] with its Heavy Metal programme ''Metalla''.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== First achievements and growth ===\nTicket sales for the 1996 festival again started sluggishly, despite a headliner like [[Kreator]] and numerous internationally renowned bands such as [[The Exploited]], [[Gorefest]], and [[Crematory (band)|Crematory]]. Management tried to prevent another loss by securing more acts and finally managed to get [[B\u00f6hse Onkelz]] to perform. The engagement of the controversial band also led to criticism, and some bands cancelled their gig in Wacken that year. Cologne band [[Brings]] called off their gig on short notice and offered to refund their fans\u2019 ticket prices.<ref>\u201eNews\" from Hamburger Abendblatt, 6. August 1996, p. 12</ref>\n\nAs a result of many visitors flooding the village in 1996, the inhabitants of Wacken voiced their concern over an event of this size being held in the local gravel pit. Uwe Trede offered to relocate the festival site to his own property and the areas previously used as campgrounds and took care of the acquisition of additional land. The organisational team grew to include Thomas Hess as production manager, who had previously been active as tour manager for Die B\u00f6hsen Onkelz, as well as Sheree Hesse for catering to the artists and VIPs. With the W.E.T.-Stage, a third stage was set up in 1997. The \"Wacken Evolution Tent\" was to be made available primarily to newcomers and bands without record deals. That year, the number of visitors reached 10,000 for the first time, with [[Rockbitch]]'s erotic stage show causing a scene.<ref>Andreas Sch\u00f6we: ''Wacken Roll \u2013 Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Heavy Metal-Festival der Welt''. H\u00f6fen 2012, p. 35\u201337</ref>\n\n=== Further development of the festival ===\n[[File:WackenOpenAir.jpg|thumb|W:O:A 2005 was attended by 40,000 people]]\nOver the years, the size of Wacken Open Air has grown continuously, and now dozens of bands and tens of thousands of visitors flock to the festival. Even though the organisers said in 2006 that 62,500 visitors were \"the limit of what is possible\",<ref>press conference in 2006 (source needed)</ref> changes were made to the structure of the festival grounds the following year by allocating a larger area to the \"Party Stage\". In addition, tickets could no longer be purchased directly on the festival grounds to reduce the number of spontaneous or ticketless visitors. In 2007 and 2008, the festival had already sold out as a result of advance ticket sales; for W:O:A 2009, tickets had even sold out by the end of 2008. The tickets for 2010, too, sold out months in advance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2010/main-news/news/ansicht/article/wahnsinn-wacken-im-5-jahr-hintereinander-ausverkauft-resttickets-bei-unseren-buspartnern-erhaeltli/|title=News on wacken.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile the festival originally only lasted two days, the performances have been lasting from Thursday to Saturday, i.e. three days, for some years. Thursday became a \"Night to Remember\", with mainly \"classical\" Heavy Metal bands appearing, such as the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] in 2006. On the actual Party Stage, younger and more modern bands play as a contrast to the \"Night to Remember\". In addition, the event is accompanied by a rich complementary programme; in addition to a merchant area \u2013 obligatory for music festivals \u2013 a beer garden has been operating since 2000, in which the [[Wacken Firefighters]]' marching band opens the festival before its official start. On Thursday in 2007, the \"Hellfest Stage\" was initiated. Since 2009, there has been a \"Medieval Stage\", where mainly [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Folk metal|Folk Metal]] bands play.\n\nThe fact that many well-known bands, including the Scorpions, [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Slayer]], and [[Helloween]], have recorded live [[DVD]]s at Wacken, shows how esteemed the Open Air has since become. Ahead of their farewell tour in 2004, Die B\u00f6hsen Onkelz also performed an extended set at W:O:A.\n\nSince 2002, the so-called \"Metal Train\" has been travelling from [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] to Wacken and back before and after the festival to bring fans to the Northern German village and provide a matching entertainment programme. Bus tours from [[Scandinavia]]n countries, especially [[Sweden]], but also from [[Austria]], are organised each year and used by several hundred fans.\n\nThe \"W:O:A Soccercup\" has been taking place annually since 2002. This football tournament, which started with nine teams and takes place on Wednesdays, has grown over the years and has been held in World Cup mode with 32 teams since 2007 (a one-off event in 2011 featured 36 teams). The international teams register in advance and are composed of festival visitors. For the tournament's 15th anniversary in 2016, a band was featured and took part for the first time: [[Serum 114]] formed a team with several fans and were able to win the tournament. Although it is meant to be a fun tournament, in which creative outfits and names take precedence over athletic performance, the award ceremony after the tournament has been held on one of the stages since 2013 and prices can be won.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210920/http://neu.woa-soccercup.de/|title=W:O:A Soccercup|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the \"Full Metal Church\" took place in Wacken for the first time. Marking the local church's 150th anniversary, the team, together with the parish, organised a concert by the band [[Faun (band)|Faun]], which was framed by two readings and sermons by \"[[Volxbibel]]\" author Martin Dreyer. Both the concert and the services were completely overcrowded by festival visitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_kAR2EWlgk|title=Full Metal Church|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Present ===\n[[File:Alice Cooper - Wacken Open Air 2017 03.jpg|left|thumb|Alice Cooper at Wacken Open Air 2017]]\nThe festival is one of the Metal scene's highlights of the year. Nowadays, about a third of the visitors, some of whom arrive quite some time before the official start of the festival, and the majority of the bands come from abroad. According to the organisers, 2018 saw visitors from more than 80 nations attending the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/die-ersten-bands-fuer-das-wacken-open-air-2019/|title=Die ersten Bands f\u00fcr das Wacken Open Air 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe number of participants increased to 75,000 in 2008 and included 65,000 paying guests.

These points of criticism were addressed by making further substantial investments in the festival's fixed and mobile infrastructure. In 2008, the organisers also contributed 1,000,000 Euros to the expansion of Wacken\u2019s local outdoor swimming pool in order to make the festival even more attractive to the residents and visitors of the town.<ref>Information provided by mayor Axel Kunkel</ref>\n\nSince 2006, the festival has been running an [[Internet radio|online radio]] station called [[Wacken Radio]], which broadcasts Metal music around the clock. It is being produced in cooperation with [[RauteMusik.FM|RauteMusik]] as of February 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rautemusik.fm/wackenradio/|title=Wacken Metal Radio \u2013 Heavy Metal Radio \u2013 Metalcore & Grindcore \u2013 RauteMusik.FM Internetradio|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Wikipedians at WOA 2011.JPG|thumb|Attendees at Wacken Open Air 2011]]\nFor the 23rd edition of Wacken Open Air, the sale of an \"X-Mas Package\" started on Monday, 8 August 2011, shortly after the end of that year's festival, and was sold out within 45 minutes. The event sold out ten times in a row between 2006 and 2015. Tickets for Wacken Open Air 2015 sold out after just 12 hours on 4 August 2014 \u2013 just a few hours after the end of W:O:A 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2014/main-tickets-shop/tickets/-/|title=Das W:O:A ist zum zehnten Mal SOLD OUT!!!|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The X-Mas Tickets for W:O:A 2016, which cost 10 Euros less and whose buyers were entitled to a free T-shirt, were completely sold out only 20 minutes after the start of pre-sales. Booking office Metaltix\u2019 servers were highly busy. In the minutes before the start of the pre-sale, the pages were no longer accessible; after that, [[Network traffic|data traffic]] had to be limited by wait lists.\n\nPrices for the festival have risen and are currently at a level similar to other major Rock festivals, such as [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring]] and [[Hurricane Festival]]. After several years of success in which the festival sold out within hours, the first 60,000 tickets for the 2017 festival were sold in mid-2016. 55,000 tickets were sold within the first hour. By the end of April 2017, the festival was almost sold out except for a few remaining tickets. The price for the festival ticket was 220 Euros, but there was no fee for early arrival campers, who often set up their elaborately designed accommodations before the festival begins \u2013 partly to get the best spots near the festival grounds. In addition, all toilets and showers were free in 2017.\n\nThe festival sold out within a few days each in 2014-2016. However, the last tickets for the 2017 festival were sold after 309 days, a mere 2 months before the start of the festival, even though only 10,000 tickets remained after the first day of sales. This was a matter of speculation at first, and reasons such as the changed security situation or the price development were taken into account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/themen/wacken-open-air/holger-huebner-darum-ist-das-woa-2017-noch-nicht-ausverkauft-id14616776.html|title=Holger H\u00fcbner: Darum ist das WOA 2017 noch nicht ausverkauft|last=|first=|date=20 August 2016|website=SHZ.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> Regardless of that, the festival sold out for the 13th time in a row in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shz.de/regionales/themen/wacken-open-air/woa-ist-ausverkauft-alle-75-000-tickets-sind-weg-id17048861.html|title=WOA ist ausverkauft \u2013 alle 75.000 Tickets sind weg|last=|first=|date=13 June 2017|website=SHZ.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 April 2018 Thomas Hess, the festival's longtime production (and former security) director, passed away. He had joined festival management in 1996 as a former tour manager of B\u00f6hse Onkelz and was considered one of the most important leading figures for the festival, along with the remaining founders and the Trede family, who organise the camping areas and the camping supervisors as subcontractors.

The name is derived from the direct translation of \"Steinburg\" from the district of [[Steinburg]], to which Wacken belongs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Stone Castle remained the company\u2019s name until 1996. Up until 2014, the headquarters were located in [[D\u00f6rpstedt|D\u00f6rpstedt (Schleswig-Flensburg district)]] and then moved to Wacken. The company's name has been ''ICS'' (International Concert Service) GmbH since 1999. The company owns the label ''Wacken Records'' and the [[Mail order|mailorder]] Metaltix, among others.\n\nA daily festival newspaper has been available since 2007, reporting on what's happening on the festival grounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Metall macht Musik|last=Eckhorst|first=Tim|publisher=TheNextArt Verlag|year=2008|isbn=978-3-939400-18-9|location=|pages=83}}</ref> The Thursday edition is also included free of charge with all newspapers published by [[Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag]].\n\nIn 2014, the online radio station RauteMusik took over production of the official Wacken radio. Wacken Radio has its own container on the festival grounds every year, where it reports live.\n\nUp until a few years ago, Wacken\u2019s official town signs were either replaced by plastic signs spelling Heavy Metal Town during W:O:A or bolted more tightly because they were often stolen as souvenirs. Some shops are now selling black cotton bags with the Wacken town sign on one side and the words \"This town sign I may keep\" on the other.\n\nAn action for exceeding the maximum noise limit, brought before the Administrative Court of Schleswig by residents of Wacken, ended in January 2013 with an out-of-court settlement. Now, if the average noise level of the festival exceeds 70&nbsp;dB, the organisers pay 1,000 Euros to the community, which donates the money to charitable causes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/musik-festival-wacken-darf-laut-bleiben-a-879534.html|title=Anwohner bes\u00e4nftigt: Wacken darf weiter rocken|last=|first=|date=|website=Spiegel Online|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\nThe site covers more than 240 [[hectare]]s, which are divided by more than 45 kilometres of fence. The inner area, including the main stage, has a size of 43,000 [[square metre]]s. More than 1,300 toilets and almost 500 showers are available for the 75,000 paying attendees. 2,200 trucks with equipment are needed for the entire festival. Stage construction and dismantling usually take 7 days and 5 days respectively. For this, 75 trucks of stage equipment (1,000 tons), 10 trucks of sound equipment and 27 trucks of lighting equipment are used.<ref name=\":5\">W:O:A press kit 2018</ref>\n\nSince 2014, the [[Electricity|electric]] output has amounted to 12 megawatts, roughly matching the needs of a small town counting 70,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wacken.shz.de/woa2014/|title=Wacken - 25 Jahre Metal-Mythos|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.saz.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> In addition, 40 diesel-fuelled [[Emergency power system|emergency power generators]] are required. 25 electricians are responsible for the power supply.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n600,000 Euros were spent on the construction of sewage systems and the improvement of power supply on the festival grounds. At the same time, 700,000 Euros worth of drains were installed in front of the stages in order to improve the drainage of water masses during heavy rains. The main paths were also paved with 10&nbsp;km of mobile roads to facilitate access for rescue vehicles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nA total of approximately 5,000 employees work for the festival, including 1,800 security staff members, 150 cleaners, 70 construction and dismantling assistants, as well as 400 police officers, 250 firefighters, 900 paramedics, and six emergency doctors.\n\nIn 2017, a beer pipeline measuring one kilometer to supply ten dispensing systems was used for the first time. At full capacity, this construction allowed for 10,000 litres of beer to be tapped within the hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rp-online.de/kultur/musik/wacken-open-air-2017-bier-pipeline-liefert-10000-liter-pro-stunde_aid-17915041|title=Wacken Open Air 2017: Bier-Pipeline liefert 10.000 Liter pro Stunde|last=|first=|date=|website=RP Online|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Stages ===\n[[File:Nightwish - Wacken Open Air 2018-1769.jpg|thumb|Faster/Harder Stages at Wacken Open Air 2018]]\nWacken Open Air now boasts eight stages for musicians and accompanying entertainment. The most important ones are the Faster and the Harder Stage, which are designed as connected twin stages and have a shared sound and lighting system. Together with the slightly smaller Louder Stage, these two stages make up the Infield, or The Holy Ground. All three stages are also equipped with [[video wall]]s to allow visibility of the performers even from remote positions.\n\nUp until 2016, these three stages were called Black Stage, True Metal Stage, and Party Stage. After Wacken 2016, visitors were encouraged to suggest new names. From these suggestions, the best ideas were to be put up to a vote in a survey. Instead, however,\u00a0 the slogan \"Faster - Harder - Louder\" became the inspiration for the names and the three stages were renamed accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/mehr-sound-und-neue-namen-die-buehnen-im-infield/|title=Mehr Sound und neue Namen \u2013 die B\u00fchnen im Infield!|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTwo more twin stages, the W.E.T. Stage (Wacken Evolution Tent) and the Headbanger Stage, are located inside a big tent called Bullhead City Circus. The Metal Battle takes place on these stages on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by regular band appearances on the days after.\n\nWhile the large stages and tent stages are open to all genres, the remaining stages are dedicated to specific themes. The Wackinger Stage is located in the medieval area of the festival and is played primarily by bands from Folk, Pagan and Medieval genres, while the Wasteland Stage, which was established in 2014, is geared towards music with an apocalyptic touch. The Beergarden Stage is modelled after typical folk festival stages, but also accommodates permanent Wacken guests such as the Wacken Firefighters and [[Mambo Kurt]].\n\n=== Event area ===\n[[File:Wastelander \u2013 Wacken Open Air 2014 05.jpg|thumb|Wasteland \u2013 apocalypse at Wacken Open Air 2014]]\nWacken Open Air's event area is divided into several structurally separated sections. Since 2014, only one major security check is performed upon entering the grounds, after that, only the festival wristbands are checked.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/ein-vierteljahrhundert-wacken-open-air-ist-history/|title=Ein Vierteljahrhundert Wacken Open Air ist History!!!|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nSpecial features of the W:O:A include the Wackinger area, which resembles a medieval market and contains specialty food and beverage stalls as well as the Wackinger Stage, where matching music is played. Various walking acts also entertain the audience. This area borders on the Wasteland designed by the [[Wasteland Warriors]], where a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world and stage (Wastelandstage) styled in homage to the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]-franchise is set up.\n\nThe area in front of the main stages comprises both the [[Bavaria]]n [[beer garden]] and a large shopping mile called Metal Markt. There are also various food stalls, the Wacken Foundation Camp, ATMs, and the Movie Field, where Heavy Metal [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and [[feature film]]s are screened.\n\nThe most important stages, the focal point of the festival, are located in the so-called Infield, which can be reached only via the Center. In addition to these stages, it also hosts food and beverage stalls.\n\n=== Camping grounds ===\n[[File:Festivalgel\u00e4nde Wasteland - Wacken Open Air 2016-AL0321.jpg|thumb|Wasteland festival grounds at Wacken Open Air 2016]]\nAs Wacken Open Air only sells 3-day tickets, the majority of visitors spend the entire festival on-site. As a result, most of the more than 240 hectares of the festival site are designated camping areas. Camping opens on Monday and has been included in the ticket price since 2017. However, in the years before, an extra fee was charged for arrival before Wednesday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/news-details/infos-zum-vorverkauf-fuer-das-woa-2017/|title=Infos zum Vorverkauf f\u00fcr das W:O:A 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe campsite is equipped with showers, flushing toilets, [[portable toilet]]s, [[drinking fountain]]s, small supermarkets, food stalls, and information boards, and is continuously patrolled by the police, fire brigade, and security services. A garbage collection service collects full garbage bags on the premises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wacken.com/de/woa2015/main-news/news/news-suche/suche-ansicht/article/metal4nature-2014-9413/|title=Metal4nature|last=|first=|date=|website=wacken.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor orientation, the individual sites called Campgrounds are marked with code letters. Campgrounds A and B are reserved for visitors arriving without a car, while Campgrounds Y and R are intended for campers and other heavy-duty vehicles. Y offers the possibility to rent entire caravans, tents or to get a power supply for your own [[Caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]]. At Campground U, large groups of 50 people or more can reserve a larger area free of charge.\n\nSince the large crowds lead to a bottleneck situation in terms of mobile service, some providers now set up portable [[base station]]s for [[GSM]], [[UMTS]], and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]+ during the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vodafone.de/featured/?vf_origin_url=music/wacken-nature-one-und-co-vodafone-ruestet-sein-netz-fuer-den-festivalsommer/|title=Wacken, Nature One und Co. \u2013 Vodafone r\u00fcstet sein Netz f\u00fcr den Festivalsommer|last=|first=|date=|website=vodafone.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical services ===\nA festival of this size needs capable medical services, which here are called the Wacken Rescue Squad. Every year, hundreds of helpers from various relief organisations from all over Germany arrive before the festival to prepare the medical camp and care for people in need during the event. The medical service is managed by the local [[German Red Cross|DRK]] association in [[Kaltenkirchen]].\n\nThe visiting and local relief organisations provide vehicles and material during the course of the festival. These include ambulances and radios for communication in particular. Due to the road conditions, quads and foot patrols are often used in Wacken, especially in the vicinity of the medical centre. In addition to the medical service, which counts approx. 270 people at peak times, the rescue service cooperation Schleswig-Holstein has more than ten emergency vehicles (ambulances and mobile intensive care units) on site while coordinating the overall [[emergency management]].\n\nIn 2013, around 3,300 people received medical care from approximately 500 paramedics.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ph/20130804124442/http://www.ndr.de/unterhaltung/events/wacken/woa_2013/wacken2849.html|title=Wacken-Fans machen sich auf den Heimweg|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Crime and accidents ===\nDespite the size of the festival, no serious security problems have been encountered so far.

Its objective is to support young bands from the Heavy Metal genre.\n\nSponsorship is granted to specific projects such as the production of a [[Compact disc|CD]] or the realisation of a tour.

The ''W:O:A History Book'' contains the open-air\u2019s history up until 2005. The book Die Wahrheit \u00fcber Wacken (\"The truth about Wacken\", Oidium Verlag 2005, new edition published at Verlag Andreas Reiffer 2011) provides a more humorous account of the festival. It was written by satirist Till Burgw\u00e4chter in collaboration with comic artist Jan Oidium and is also available as an audio book comprising three CDs. The publication of a Metal cookbook shows how far merchandising has come. However, the mounting range of merchandising has led to growing criticism, as some consider it to be purely profit-oriented. The increasing coverage of the festival, especially in the wake of the documentary [[Full Metal Village]], is perceived by the traditional Metal scene as \"selling out\".\n\nIn 2005, Wacken Premium [[Pilsner]] was offered as the festival\u2019s \"own\" beer for the first time. It was produced in the Bavarian [[brewery]] Maximiliansbrauerei in [[Chieming]]. At W:O:A 2006 and 2007, the beer was available as well, this time produced in 0.5-litre bottles by the [[Flensburger Brauerei|Flensburger]] brewery. The large number of glass shards later forced the organisers to switch to 0.5-litre cans.\n\nAs a [[motto]], the phrase \"See you in Wacken - Rain or Shine\" has established itself alongside \"Faster, Harder, Louder\". Additionally, the festival features the sentence \"Louder Than Hell\" in its advertising.\n\n=== Full Metal Cruise ===\n[[Cruise ship|Cruises]] with Heavy Metal bands on board under the name [[Full Metal Cruise]] have been organised within Europe since 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamburg.de/kreuzfahrtschiffe/3500106/full-metal-cruise/|title=Full Metal Cruise: Heavy Metal auf hoher See|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Hamburg Metal Dayz ===\nThe indoor festival [[Hamburg Metal Dayz]] takes place at the same time as the [[Reeperbahn]]-Festival and is considered a get-together for the scene. In addition to concerts, there are panels with musicians, managers, and other Metal experts, as well as workshops and a question and answer session with the W:O:A organisers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hh-mittendrin.de/2014/09/hamburg-metal-dayz-gepflegter-krach-in-der-markthalle/|title=Hamburg Metal Dayz \u2013 gepflegter Krach in der Markthalle|last=|first=|date=23 September 2014|website=hh-mittendrin.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Wacken Roadshow ===\n[[File:Grailknights \u2013 Wacken Roadshow 2014 01.jpg|thumb|[[Grailknights]] at Wacken Roadshow 2014]]\nFor the Wacken Roadshow, several bands tour Europe under the banner of Wacken Open Air.

For five years, regional, national and international Metal bands like De la Cruz, 5th Avenue, and King K\u00f8ng played at Knust every Monday. After a break of almost 20 years, Metal Monday was revived by the Wacken Open Air organisers in 2014 in cooperation with the Knust, Seaside Touring, All Access, and Hamburg Konzerte. Metal, Rock, and Folkrock bands now perform once a month, following the motto \"three bands - small entrance fee\". In addition to regional bands, international newcomers are always invited.\n\n=== Zum Wackinger ===\n[[File:Martin Semmelrogge - Zum Wackinger - Wacken Winter Nights 2017 08.jpg|thumb|Reading with [[Martin Semmelrogge]] at Zum Wackinger 2017]]\nThe former country-style restaurant ''Zur Post'' in Wacken, built in 1919, has been the hub of the village and the surrounding communities for decades. It was here that bartenders Thomas Jensen and Holger H\u00fcbner conceived the idea for today's Wacken Open Air. Today, it is used to accommodate staff and to serve other business purposes. A series of events called \"Zum Wackinger\" sees artists from music, comedy, and entertainment perform regularly. Since 2016, a two-day medieval feast with jugglers and bards takes place here.<ref>press kit ICS Network, ''Zum Wackinger'', September 2016 (p. 37)</ref>\n\n=== Metal Church ===\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Village Church in Wacken belongs to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] congregation of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in [[Northern Germany]]. For Wacken Open Air and Wacken Winter Nights, it is turned into the ''Metal Church''. During said festivals, the ''Metal Service'' is held here and bands from the Folk and Medieval scene perform in the church.\n\n=== Wacken Winter Nights ===\n[[File:Dunkelsch\u00f6n - Metal Church - Wacken Winter Nights 2017 01.jpg|thumb|[[Dunkelsch\u00f6n]] at Metal Church during Wacken Winter Nights]]\nWacken Winter Nights (WWN), a three-day Folk and Medieval open-air festival, took place for the first time in February 2017 at temperatures of -2 to -6 degrees Celsius in Wacken. With over 3,500 attendees, the festival's first edition sold out several weeks in advance. Most of them spent the nights on the camping site. A second edition took place from 23 to 25 February 2018.

The first documentary, [[Metalheads - The Official Documentary]], was produced in 1999 on the occasion of the festival's 10th anniversary and was released on [[VHS]] by [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] in 2000. The film team lived on the festival grounds for ten days prior to the actual start of the festival and documented the work of construction workers, farmers such as Uwe Trede, villagers, fans and organisers. Although the film shows excerpts from performances by some of the bands and interviews with the artists, it is more of a behind-the-scenes documentary. The film was produced with the simplest means, including a professional [[8 mm video format|Hi8]] and a [[DV|Mini-DV]] camera and a team of three, and was regarded by the organisers as a trial run on the subject of film. According to the organisers, a total of 10,000 copies were made and sold. The film ''Nordland'' was shot for the 15th edition of W:O:A, but was only used for internal promotion. Both films were made by Thomas Greiner.\n\nThe documentary [[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey|Metal - A Headbanger's Journey]] by [[Sam Dunn]] (2005) features Wacken Open Air. The festival is described as a [[Mecca]] of Heavy Metal. The film [[Full Metal Village]] by director [[Cho Sung-hyung|Cho Sung-Hyung]], made in 2005 and 2006, portrays the people of Wacken dealing with the festival. In 2006, she was awarded the main award of the [[Hessischer Filmpreis]] and the [[Schleswig-Holstein Filmpreis]] for best documentary. Full Metal Village was the first documentary ever to win the [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] Award for young filmmakers in 2007.

However, there has been criticism of the fact that the Wacken Firefighters have been featured too prominently. The three Rockpalast documentaries focus on interviews with the musicians and the performances of the bands.\n\nAnother perspective is offered by the low-budget production ''Metaller die auf Br\u00fcste starren'' (\"The Metalheads Who Stare At Breasts\", title based on [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare At Goats]]), which five festival attendees shot during their stay at Wacken. \"Offener Kanal Bad Offenbach\" is listed as its official producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.okbo.de/|title=OKBO \u2013 Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> The film shows the festival from the filmmakers\u2019 (subjective) point of view and comments on the events in the style of [[New Journalism]]. In contrast to other documentaries, this one focuses on the fans. Whether it's a documentary in the true sense of the word or whether the film is just entertainment remains controversial. The filmmakers themselves avoid this question and classify their work as a \"trash documentary\".

Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love]] when he meets Mary Swanson a woman he is driving to the airport. She leaves a briefcase in the terminal; Lloyd, unaware that it contains ransom money for her kidnapped husband, Bobby, and that she was supposed to leave it there for the kidnappers to pick up, retrieves it and tries to return it to her before the kidnappers can get it. Her [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]-bound plane has already departed, leading to Lloyd running through and falling out of the [[jetway]].\n\nFired from his job, Lloyd returns to his apartment and learns that Harry has also been fired from his dog-grooming job after delivering dogs late to a show and accidentally getting them dirty. Bobby's kidnappers, Joe \"Mental\" Mentalino and J. P. Shay, follow Lloyd home from the airport in pursuit of the briefcase. Mistaking the crooks for debt collectors, the duo flee the apartment and return later to find that Mental and Shay have decapitated Harry's [[parakeet]]. Lloyd suggests they head to Aspen to find Mary and return the briefcase, hoping she can \"plug them into the social pipeline.\" At first, Harry opposes the idea, but he eventually agrees and the duo leaves the next day.\n\nMental and Shay catch up to the duo at a motel that night. Posing as a hitchhiker, Mental is picked up by Harry and Lloyd while Shay secretly follows them. During a lunch stop, the duo prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, not knowing of his [[ulcer]]. When Mental reacts adversely, they accidentally kill him with rat poison pills (which he planned to use on them) after mistaking it for his medication. Nearing Colorado, Lloyd takes a wrong turn and ends up driving all night through [[Nebraska]], while the police waiting on the road to Colorado expect them to show up after finding out about Mental's death. Upon waking up and realizing Lloyd's mishap, Harry gives up on the journey and decides to walk home, but Lloyd later persuades him to continue after trading the van for a [[minibike]].\n\nThe two arrive in Aspen, but are unable to locate Mary. After a short scuffle over some gloves that night, the briefcase breaks open and they discover the money; they spend it for a hotel suite, clothes and a [[Lamborghini Diablo]]. They learn that Mary and her family are hosting a gala and prepare to attend. At the gala, Harry, attempting to lure Mary over to Lloyd, reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day and lies to Lloyd that he got him a date. The next day, Lloyd finds out Harry lied to him after waiting all day for Mary at the hotel bar.\n\nIn retaliation, Lloyd pranks Harry by serving him a coffee laced with [[laxative]], causing Harry to spontaneously defecate in a broken toilet at Mary's house. Lloyd arrives at Mary's house and informs her that he has her briefcase. He takes her to the hotel, shows her the briefcase, and confesses his love after some initial struggle; she rejects him, as she is already married. Nicholas Andre, an old friend of the Swansons and the mastermind behind Bobby's kidnapping, arrives with Shay and, upon learning that Harry and Lloyd had spent all of the ransom money and replaced it with [[IOU]]s, takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, as well as Harry when he returns. An argument leads Nicholas to shoot Harry. Before Nicholas can kill them, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] team led by Beth Jordon (whom Harry met earlier at a gas station) raids the suite and arrests him and Shay and Harry is revealed to be alive thanks to a bulletproof vest that was strapped on him earlier. Mary and Bobby are reunited. Lloyd, jealous that he can never be with Mary because she is married, fantasizes about shooting Bobby dead.\n\nThe next day, Harry and Lloyd begin walking home. All of the items they bought were confiscated and their moped has broken down. The two unknowingly decline the chance to be oil boys for a group of bikini girls, after which Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their \"break\" one day. Harry and Lloyd then play a friendly game of [[Tag (game)|tag]] as they walk back home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Lloyd Christmas: A chip-toothed slacker who has been fired from several jobs.

Lloyd, a chip-toothed limousine driver, [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love]] when he meets Mary Swanson a woman he is driving to the airport. She leaves a briefcase in the terminal; Lloyd, unaware that it contains ransom money for her kidnapped husband, Bobby, and that she was supposed to leave it there for the kidnappers to pick up, retrieves it and tries to return it to her before the kidnappers can get it. Her [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]-bound plane has already departed, leading to Lloyd running through and falling out of the [[jetway]].\n\nFired from his job, Lloyd returns to his apartment and learns that Harry has also been fired from his dog-grooming job after delivering dogs late to a show and accidentally getting them dirty. Bobby's kidnappers, Joe \"Mental\" Mentalino and J. P. Shay, follow Lloyd home from the airport in pursuit of the briefcase. Mistaking the crooks for debt collectors, the duo flee the apartment and return later to find that Mental and Shay have decapitated Harry's [[parakeet]]. Lloyd suggests they head to Aspen to find Mary and return the briefcase, hoping she can \"plug them into the social pipeline.\" At first, Harry opposes the idea, but he eventually agrees and the duo leaves the next day.\n\nMental and Shay catch up to the duo at a motel that night. Posing as a hitchhiker, Mental is picked up by Harry and Lloyd while Shay secretly follows them. During a lunch stop, the duo prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, not knowing of his [[ulcer]]. When Mental reacts adversely, they accidentally kill him with rat poison pills (which he planned to use on them) after mistaking it for his medication. Nearing Colorado, Lloyd takes a wrong turn and ends up driving all night through [[Nebraska]], while the police waiting on the road to Colorado expect them to show up after finding out about Mental's death. Upon waking up and realizing Lloyd's mishap, Harry gives up on the journey and decides to walk home, but Lloyd later persuades him to continue after trading the van for a [[minibike]].\n\nThe two arrive in Aspen, but are unable to locate Mary. After a short scuffle over some gloves that night, the briefcase breaks open and they discover the money; they spend it for a hotel suite, clothes and a [[Lamborghini Diablo]]. They learn that Mary and her family are hosting a gala and prepare to attend. At the gala, Harry, attempting to lure Mary over to Lloyd, reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day and lies to Lloyd that he got him a date. The next day, Lloyd finds out Harry lied to him after waiting all day for Mary at the hotel bar.\n\nIn retaliation, Lloyd pranks Harry by serving him a coffee laced with [[laxative]], causing Harry to spontaneously defecate in a broken toilet at Mary's house. Lloyd arrives at Mary's house and informs her that he has her briefcase. He takes her to the hotel, shows her the briefcase, and confesses his love after some initial struggle; she rejects him, as she is already married. Nicholas Andre, an old friend of the Swansons and the mastermind behind Bobby's kidnapping, arrives with Shay and, upon learning that Harry and Lloyd had spent all of the ransom money and replaced it with [[IOU]]s, takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, as well as Harry when he returns. An argument leads Nicholas to shoot Harry. Before Nicholas can kill them, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] team led by Beth Jordon (whom Harry met earlier at a gas station) raids the suite and arrests him and Shay and Harry is revealed to be alive thanks to a bulletproof vest that was strapped on him earlier. Mary and Bobby are reunited. Lloyd, jealous that he can never be with Mary because she is married, fantasizes about shooting Bobby dead.\n\nThe next day, Harry and Lloyd begin walking home. All of the items they bought were confiscated and their moped has broken down. The two unknowingly decline the chance to be oil boys for a group of bikini girls, after which Harry tells Lloyd that they will get their \"break\" one day. Harry and Lloyd then play a friendly game of [[Tag (game)|tag]] as they walk back home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Lloyd Christmas: A chip-toothed slacker who has been fired from several jobs.
