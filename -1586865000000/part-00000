It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Onanefe Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

But these minerals are under-utilized. \n\nDelta state also has huge deposits of crude oil and is also one of the largest producers of petroleum products in Nigeria. Sales of petroleum products is what majorly drives its economy.\n\n== Higher education ==\nDelta state has one of the highest numbers of tertiary institutions in any Nigerian state. This is a product of the people's thirst for knowledge and academic work. Some of these institutions are: \n*[[Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun|Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun]]\n*[[Delta State University, Abraka|Delta State University]]\n*[[Delta State Polytechnic]]s (three different Polytechnics, one at Oghara, one at Ogwashi-Uku and another at Ozoro)\n*The Film and Broadcast Academy, Ozoro\n*College of Education (two different state colleges, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]]).\n*Federal College of Education Technical, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*College of Education, Mosogar\n*Delta State College of Health Technology, [[Ughelli]]\n*[[Petroleum Training Institute]], [[Effurun]]<ref>http://www.edusbaze.com/tag/www-pti-edu-ng/</ref>\n*[[Western Delta University]], [[Oghara]]\n*Novena University, Ogume-Amai\n*National Open University of Nigeria (three study centres, one at Asaba, one at [[Emevor]] and another at [[Owhrode]]).\n*Delta State School of Marine Technology, Burutu\n*Nigerian Maritime University, Okerenkoko, [[Warri]]\n*Conarina School of Maritime & Transport Technology, Oria-[[Abraka]]\n*University of Information and Communication Technology, [[Agbor]]\n*State School of Midwifery, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*School of Nursing (two schools, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]])\n*Baptist School of Nursing, [[Eku]]\n*Edwin Clark University, Kiagbodo\n*Eagle Heights University, Omadino, Warri\n*Admiralty University of Nigeria at [[Ibusa]] and [[Sapele]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State has some historical, cultural and socio-political tourist centers that attract visitors from around the globe. Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]].

It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

But these minerals are under-utilized. \n\nDelta state also has huge deposits of crude oil and is also one of the largest producers of petroleum products in Nigeria. Sales of petroleum products is what majorly drives its economy.\n\n== Higher education ==\nDelta state has one of the highest numbers of tertiary institutions in any Nigerian state. This is a product of the people's thirst for knowledge and academic work. Some of these institutions are: \n*[[Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun|Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun]]\n*[[Delta State University, Abraka|Delta State University]]\n*[[Delta State Polytechnic]]s (three different Polytechnics, one at Oghara, one at Ogwashi-Uku and another at Ozoro)\n*The Film and Broadcast Academy, Ozoro\n*College of Education (two different state colleges, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]]).\n*Federal College of Education Technical, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*College of Education, Mosogar\n*Delta State College of Health Technology, [[Ughelli]]\n*[[Petroleum Training Institute]], [[Effurun]]<ref>http://www.edusbaze.com/tag/www-pti-edu-ng/</ref>\n*[[Western Delta University]], [[Oghara]]\n*Novena University, Ogume-Amai\n*National Open University of Nigeria (three study centres, one at Asaba, one at [[Emevor]] and another at [[Owhrode]]).\n*Delta State School of Marine Technology, Burutu\n*Nigerian Maritime University, Okerenkoko, [[Warri]]\n*Conarina School of Maritime & Transport Technology, Oria-[[Abraka]]\n*University of Information and Communication Technology, [[Agbor]]\n*State School of Midwifery, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*School of Nursing (two schools, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]])\n*Baptist School of Nursing, [[Eku]]\n*Edwin Clark University, Kiagbodo\n*Eagle Heights University, Omadino, Warri\n*Admiralty University of Nigeria at [[Ibusa]] and [[Sapele]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State has some historical, cultural and socio-political tourist centers that attract visitors from around the globe. Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]]. It is believed that the bible descended to this spot miraculously from heaven around August, 1914. The bible dropped on rain-soaked yam and it didn't get wet. The site now attracts thousands of Christians yearly.\n* '''Demas Nwoko Edifice '''which was built using traditional materials, designs and construction techniques of the Igbo civilization and the Benin Empire by [[Demas Nwoko]], an architect, builder and artist of international repute from Idumuje-Ugboko, in Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State.\n* '''The Mungo Park House''' which is now the site of the National Museum, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. The house was constructed by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886 and was used as a colonial administrative headquarters, a military house, the colonial administrative divisional headquarters, the RNC Constabulary building,  and the seat of the Urban District Council at different times.\n* The '''[[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger Bridge]]''' which connects Delta State (by extension, western Nigeria) to the Eastern part of Nigeria. It is a beauty to behold. It was completed in 1965 and cost \u00a35 million. It was damaged during the civil war, but later repaired.\n* '''Lander Brothers Anchorage, Asaba''' which was built in memory of early British explorers. The complex has a museum, a graveyard, and many artworks and writings. It houses a replica of one of the boats that was used by the brothers.\n* '''Falcorp Mangrove Park'''\n* '''Warri Kingdom Royal Cemetery''' which is 512 year old burial ground and serves as the resting place of past rulers of Warri kingdom. A tree is planted on each grave.\n\n==Sports==\nDelta State is known to have produced several sportsmen and women, notably [[Stephen Keshi|Stephen Okechukwu Keshi]], [[Sunday Oliseh]], Austin [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], [[Wilson Oruma]], [[Efetobore Sodje]] [[Blessing Okagbare]] and [[Jonathan Akpoborie]], [[Cindy Ofili]].\n\n==Notable people==\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n*[[Abel Ubeku]], first black Managing Director of Guinness Nigeria Plc.\n*[[Alibaba Akpobome]], stand up comedian and actor\n*[[Amaju Pinnick]], president of the Nigeria Football Federation\n*[[Ayo Oritsejafor]], founder of Word of Life Bible Church\n*[[Ben Okri]], writer\n*[[Blessing Okagbare]], athlete, [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] and [[World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] medalist in the long jump, and a world medallist in the [[200 metres]]\n*[[Bovi]], popular Nigerian comedian\n*[[Bruce Onobrakpeya]], 2006 UNESCO Living Human Treasure Award, trustee of Western Niger Delta University\n*[[David Dafinone]], Renowned Account/Politician\n*[[Dennis Osadebay]]\n*[[Dominic Oneya]]\n*[[Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu]], Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Nigeria.\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]]\n*[[Enebeli Elebuwa]], Nigeria Actor\n*[[Gamaliel Onosode]]\n*[[Harrysong]]\n*[[I Go Dye]], popular comedian across Africa and [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]] Ambassador\n*[[Igho Sanomi]], Nigerian businessman\n*[[James Ibori]], former governor of Delta State\n*[[Jay-Jay Okocha|Okocha]], former Super Eagles Captain\n*[[Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin]], founder of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry\n*[[Jim Ovia]] \n*[[J.

O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H.

It features a fast beat with lyrics about a woman who has been attacked in her apartment by a \"smooth criminal\". The refrain \"Annie, are you OK?\" was inspired by [[Resusci Anne]], a dummy used in [[CPR]] training.\n\n\"Smooth Criminal\" peaked at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the sixth top 10 single from ''Bad''.<ref name=\"awards2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bad-mw0000650293/awards|title=Bad > Awards|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref> It also peaked at number two on the [[Hot Black Singles|''Billboard'' Hot Black Singles]] chart.

Ant Farm album)|Anthology]]''. According to the band members, they would play a few riffs of the Jackson song while warming up before gigs and audience members would request them to play the entire song. This positive feedback encouraged them to record their own rendition of \"Smooth Criminal\" and include it on ''Anthology''.\n\nThe cover became a number one hit on ''Billboard'''s [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and was also a number one hit in Australia and New Zealand. It reached number three in the UK. The music video was directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]], and features multiple references to Michael Jackson music videos, including the \"Smooth Criminal\" video itself. Their 1999 album ''Greatest Hits'' includes a hidden track named \"Slick Thief\", which is an early version of \"Smooth Criminal\".\n\n===Charts===\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable

The film was shot between mid-February and April 1987 at [[Culver City, California]] and in the [[backlot]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].<ref name=\"Every\">{{cite book|first1= Richard |last1= Lecocq |first2= Fran\u00e7ois |last2= Allard |year= 2018 |title= Michael Jackson All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track |chapter= Bad |location= London, England |publisher= [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] |isbn= 9781788400572 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4qJfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT500}}</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-michael-jackson-for-real-19870924|title=Is Michael Jackson For Real?|publisher=}}</ref> The video premiered on [[MTV]] on October 13, 1988.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}[[File:Smooth criminal video.jpg|thumb|Jackson performing the \"anti-gravity lean\" in the \"Smooth Criminal\" music video.|alt=|255x255px]]The style of clothing as well as mannerisms Jackson portrayed were reused in the numerous adaptations of the video game ''[[Michael Jackson's Moonwalker]]''.

Ant Farm album)|Anthology]]''. According to the band members, they would play a few riffs of the Jackson song while warming up before gigs and audience members would request them to play the entire song. This positive feedback encouraged them to record their own rendition of \"Smooth Criminal\" and include it on ''Anthology''.\n\nThe cover became a number one hit on ''Billboard'''s [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and was also a number one hit in Australia and New Zealand. It reached number three in the UK. The music video was directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]], and features multiple references to Michael Jackson music videos, including the \"Smooth Criminal\" video itself. Their 1999 album ''Greatest Hits'' includes a hidden track named \"Slick Thief\", which is an early version of \"Smooth Criminal\".\n\n===Charts===\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That\u2019s not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \u201cgroaning\u201d within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what\u2019s happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That\u2019s not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \u201cgroaning\u201d within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what\u2019s happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead.
