Depressed, he begins working as a bank teller until he meets beautiful Jill Collins ([[Sally Eilers]]), a [[barnstorming]] [[parachuting|parachutist]] working with her daredevil pilot brother. Jim is immediately attracted to Jill, and when her brother is killed in a freak crash, he reveals his past and volunteers to replace her dead sibling in their act. As they tour throughout the Southwest, their affection turns physically intimate when they are on the road as they characteristically sleep in adjoining hotel rooms. \n\nJim, believes that his risky lifestyle precludes the luxury of a wife and family while Jill wants marriage. When Jim's brother \"Bud\" ([[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]]) joins them, he too is immediately attracted to Jill but respects his brother's relationship, However, after another freak accident puts Jim in the hospital for a prolonged convalescence, Jim returns to find them married and in bed together. Angry and bitter, he becomes a [[mercenary|soldier of fortune]] and loses an eye and a leg flying for the Communist rebels in China and Chile. \n\nAfter a prolonged estrangement, a chastened Jim goes to Cuba to rejoin Bud and Jill but finds his brother's aircraft has gone down in a storm in the Gulf of Mexico. With only a short window of opportunity to save Bud and his passengers, Jim volunteers to go into the storm to save his brother.\n\nAfter finding the downed aircraft and saving all the passengers, he flies back but a heavy fog comes in and Jim cannot see well enough to land. All the cars in the city then line up in an old airfield, and with the help of their headlights and horns, Jim lands safely. Realizing how much Neil loves Jill, Jim leaves town again, but this time on better terms with his brother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Barthelmess]] as James \"Jim\" Blaine\n* [[Sally Eilers]] as Jill Collins\n* [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]] as Neil \"Bud\" Blaine\n* [[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]] as Mr. Blaine\n* [[James Murray (American actor)|James Murray]] as Eddie Hughes\n* [[Claire McDowell]] as Mrs. Blaine\n* [[Willard Robertson]] as Havana Airport Manager\n* Arthur Vinton as Amarillo Airport Manager\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Hotel Maid (uncredited)\n* [[Harrison Greene]] as Pomona Air Circus Announcer (uncredited)\n* [[Fred Toones]] as El Paso Craps Shooter (uncredited)\n* [[John Wayne]] as co-pilot in aircraft wreck (uncredited)\n* [[Lester Dorr]] as hotel desk clerk (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nProduction  on ''Central Airport'' took place at [[Hollywood Burbank Airport|Wilson Airport]] and [[Hollywood Burbank Airport|United Airport]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California.<ref>Stafford, Jeff.

The two campuses are located approximately 90 miles apart, and are the closest SEC schools in terms of distance.\n\nEntering its 97th meeting as of the 2012 football season, Alabama-Mississippi State is one of the SEC's longest-running series, dating back to 1896.\n\n=== All-time record vs. SEC teams ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Mississippi State Bulldogs|Opponent|Won|Lost|Tied|Percentage|Streak|First|Last}}\n|- \n| [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/alabama|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Alabama Crimson Tide football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 18 || 82 || 3 || {{winpct|18|82|3}} || Lost 12 || 1896 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/arkansas|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Arkansas Razorbacks football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 13 || 16 || 1 || {{winpct|13|16|1}} || Won 3 || 1916 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/auburn|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Auburn Tigers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 27 || 64 || 3 || {{winpct|27|64|3}} || Lost 1 || 1905 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Florida Gators football|Florida]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/florida|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Florida Gators football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 19 || 34 || 2 || {{winpct|19|34|2}} || Lost 1 || 1923 || 2018\n|- \n| [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/georgia|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Georgia Bulldogs football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 6 || 18 || 0 || {{winpct|6|18}} || Lost 2 || 1914 || 2017\n|- \n| [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/kentucky|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Kentucky Wildcats football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 24 || 23 || 0 || {{winpct|24|23}} || Won 1 || 1914 || 2019\n|- \n| [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/lsu|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. LSU Tigers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 35 || 75 || 3 || {{winpct|35|75|3}} || Lost 2 || 1896 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/missouri|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Missouri Tigers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 1 || 2 || 0 || {{winpct|1|2}} || Won 1 || 1981 || 2015\n|- \n| [[Mississippi Rebels football|Ole Miss]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/ole-miss|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Ole Miss Rebels football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 46 || 62 || 6 || {{winpct|46|62|6}} || Won 2 || 1901 || 2019\n|- \n| [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/south-carolina|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. South Carolina Gamecocks football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 7 || 9 || 0 || {{winpct|7|9}} || Won 1 || 1992 || 2016\n|- \n| [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/tennessee|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Tennessee Volunteers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 16 || 29 || 1 || {{winpct|16|29|1}} || Lost 1 || 1907 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/texas-am|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Texas A&M Aggies football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 7 || 6 || 0 || {{winpct|7|6}} || Lost 1 || 1912 || 2019\n|- \n| [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/mississippi-state/vs/vanderbilt|title=Winsipedia - Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Vanderbilt Commodores football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref> || 13 || 7 || 2 || {{winpct|13|7|2}} || Won 3 || 1904 || 2014\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Mississippi State Bulldogs|Totals|231|428|21|{{winpct|231|428|21}}|||}}\n|}\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===The cowbell===\n{{very long section|date=April 2018}}\nThe most unusual and certainly the most resounding symbol of Mississippi State University tradition is the cowbell. Despite decades of attempts by opponents and authorities to banish it from scenes of competition,<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/shug-jordan-theres-no-place-for-cowbells-in-college-football/ Shug Jordan: 'The cowbells have no place in football']: The War Eagle Reader</ref> diehard State fans still celebrate Bulldog victories loudly and proudly with the distinctive sound of ringing cowbells.\n\nThe precise origin of the cowbell as a fixture of Mississippi State sports tradition remains unclear to this day. The best records have cowbells gradually introduced to the MSU sports scene in the late 1930s and early 1940s, coinciding with the 'golden age' of Mississippi State football success\nprior to World War II.\n\nThe most popular legend is that during a home football game between State and arch-rival Ole Miss, a jersey cow wandered onto the playing field. Mississippi State soundly whipped the Rebels that Saturday, and State College students immediately adopted the cow as a good luck charm. Students are said to have continued bringing a cow to football games for a while, until the practice was eventually discontinued in favor of bringing just the cow's bell.\n\nWhatever the origin, it is certain that by the 1950s cowbells were common at Mississippi State games, and by the 1960s were established as the special symbol of Mississippi State. Ironically, the cowbell's popularity grew most rapidly during the long years when State football teams were rarely successful. Flaunting this anachronism from the 'aggie' days was a proud response by students and alumni to outsider scorn of the university's 'cow college' history.\n\nIn the 1960s two MSU professors, Earl W. Terrell and Ralph L. Reeves obliged some students by welding handles on the bells to they could be rung with much more convenience and authority. By 1963 the demand for these long-handled cowbells could not be filled by home workshops alone, so at the suggestion of Reeves the Student Association bought bells in bulk and the Industrial Education Club agreed to weld on handles. In 1964 the MSU Bookstore began marketing these cowbells with a portion of the profits returning to these student organizations.\n\nToday many styles of cowbells are available on campus and around Starkville, with the top-of-the-line a heavy chrome-plated model with a full Bulldog figurine handle. But experts insist the best and loudest results are produced by a classic long-handled, bicycle-grip bell made of thinner and tightly-welded shells.\n\nCowbells decorate offices and homes of Mississippi State alumni, and are passed down through generations of Bulldog fans.\n\nIn early 1975, the SEC adopted a rule against artificial noisemakers that made it illegal to ring a cowbell during games; an official complaint by Auburn coach Shug Jordan, whose disapproval of the tradition went back several years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/did-auburn-players-ring-cowbells-during-a-mississippi-state-game-in-the-late-1960s/#.VDvUZOfOSDo|title=Did Auburn players ring cowbells during a Mississippi State game in the late 1960s?|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> after the Tigers narrow 1974 win over the Bulldogs was largely responsible for the decision.<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/shug-jordan-theres-no-place-for-cowbells-in-college-football/#.VDvQaOfOSDo Shug Jordan: \u2018The cowbells have no place in football\u2019]: The War Eagle Reader</ref> At one point during the game, Jordan instructed his quarterback not to run a play in protest of officials refusing to quiet the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/former-au-quarterback-phil-gargis-talks-about-the-1974-auburn-mississippi-state-game-that-led-to-cow-bell-ban/#.VDvVAOfOSDo|title=Former AU quarterback Phil Gargis talks about the 1974 Auburn-Mississippi State game that led to cowbell ban|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> Jordan's dislike for the cowbells inspired Alabama to attempt to purchase 1,000 cowbells from Mississippi State for Alabama fans to take to the Iron Bowl; MSU declined the offer.<ref name=\"thewareaglereader1974\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/the-university-of-alabama-tried-to-buy-1000-cowbells-to-bring-to-the-1974-iron-bowl-texas-fans-took-them-to-annoy-auburn-at-the-gator-bowl/#.VDvTZOfOSDo|title=The University of Alabama tried to buy 1,000 cowbells from Mississippi State to bring to the 1974 Iron Bowl; Texas fans took them to annoy Auburn at the Gator Bowl|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> University of Texas fans also attempted to annoy Jordan with cowbells during the 1974 Gator Bowl.<ref name=\"thewareaglereader1974\"/> Shortly after the ban was enacted, Mississippi State officials considered other items and devices to replace the cowbells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvQ_efOSDo|title=Mississippi State considered handheld mirrors, cow tails as replacement traditions when cowbells were banned in 1975|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013032138/http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvQ_efOSDo|archivedate=2014-10-13}}</ref> In 1981, a Mississippi State faculty member filed a suit against Auburn University and the Southeastern Conference that sought to have the rule declared unconstitutional after his cowbell was confiscated at the 1981 AU-MSU game at Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium.<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/mississippi-state-fan-sues-auburn-sec-over-confiscated-cowbell/#.VC_zu-fOSDo Mississippi State fan sues Auburn, SEC over confiscated cowbell; calls rule \u2018unconstitutional\u2019]: The War Eagle Reader</ref> Despite creative efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvVmufOSDo|title=Mississippi State considered handheld mirrors, cow tails as replacement traditions when cowbells were banned in 1975|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013032138/http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvVmufOSDo|archivedate=2014-10-13}}</ref> by MSU fans to circumvent the ruling and continue the tradition, the ban was in effect until 2010.\n\nThat spring, the 12 schools of the SEC agreed to a compromise on artificial noisemakers, acknowledging the role cowbells play in the history of Mississippi State University by amending the conference by-law. In the fall of 2010, on a one-year trial with specified restrictions, cowbells were permitted in Davis Wade Stadium for the first time in 36 years. And due to MSU fans' notable adherence to the rules outlined by the league, cowbells will continue to be allowed with similar restrictions in place. In 2012, the rule was made permanent by the SEC.\n\n===Maroon and white===\nMaroon and White are the distinctive colors of Mississippi State University athletic teams, dating back over a century to the very first football game ever played by the school's student-athletes.\n\nOn November 15, 1895, the first Mississippi A&M football team was preparing for a road trip to [[Jackson, Tennessee]]., to play Southern Baptist University (now called [[Union University]]) the following day. Since every college was supposed to have its own uniform colors, the A&M student body requested that the school's team select a suitable combination.\n\nConsidering making this choice an honor, the inaugural State team gave the privilege to team captain W.M. Matthews. Accounts report that without hesitation Matthews chose Maroon and White.\n\n== Recruiting ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\nMississippi State Bulldogs Football 247Sports team

Despite decades of attempts by opponents and authorities to banish it from scenes of competition,<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/shug-jordan-theres-no-place-for-cowbells-in-college-football/ Shug Jordan: 'The cowbells have no place in football']: The War Eagle Reader</ref> diehard State fans still celebrate Bulldog victories loudly and proudly with the distinctive sound of ringing cowbells.\n\nThe precise origin of the cowbell as a fixture of Mississippi State sports tradition remains unclear to this day. The best records have cowbells gradually introduced to the MSU sports scene in the late 1930s and early 1940s, coinciding with the 'golden age' of Mississippi State football success\nprior to World War II.\n\nThe most popular legend is that during a home football game between State and arch-rival Ole Miss, a jersey cow wandered onto the playing field. Mississippi State soundly whipped the Rebels that Saturday, and State College students immediately adopted the cow as a good luck charm. Students are said to have continued bringing a cow to football games for a while, until the practice was eventually discontinued in favor of bringing just the cow's bell.\n\nWhatever the origin, it is certain that by the 1950s cowbells were common at Mississippi State games, and by the 1960s were established as the special symbol of Mississippi State. Ironically, the cowbell's popularity grew most rapidly during the long years when State football teams were rarely successful. Flaunting this anachronism from the 'aggie' days was a proud response by students and alumni to outsider scorn of the university's 'cow college' history.\n\nIn the 1960s two MSU professors, Earl W. Terrell and Ralph L. Reeves obliged some students by welding handles on the bells to they could be rung with much more convenience and authority. By 1963 the demand for these long-handled cowbells could not be filled by home workshops alone, so at the suggestion of Reeves the Student Association bought bells in bulk and the Industrial Education Club agreed to weld on handles. In 1964 the MSU Bookstore began marketing these cowbells with a portion of the profits returning to these student organizations.\n\nToday many styles of cowbells are available on campus and around Starkville, with the top-of-the-line a heavy chrome-plated model with a full Bulldog figurine handle. But experts insist the best and loudest results are produced by a classic long-handled, bicycle-grip bell made of thinner and tightly-welded shells.\n\nCowbells decorate offices and homes of Mississippi State alumni, and are passed down through generations of Bulldog fans.\n\nIn early 1975, the SEC adopted a rule against artificial noisemakers that made it illegal to ring a cowbell during games; an official complaint by Auburn coach Shug Jordan, whose disapproval of the tradition went back several years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/did-auburn-players-ring-cowbells-during-a-mississippi-state-game-in-the-late-1960s/#.VDvUZOfOSDo|title=Did Auburn players ring cowbells during a Mississippi State game in the late 1960s?|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> after the Tigers narrow 1974 win over the Bulldogs was largely responsible for the decision.<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/shug-jordan-theres-no-place-for-cowbells-in-college-football/#.VDvQaOfOSDo Shug Jordan: \u2018The cowbells have no place in football\u2019]: The War Eagle Reader</ref> At one point during the game, Jordan instructed his quarterback not to run a play in protest of officials refusing to quiet the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/former-au-quarterback-phil-gargis-talks-about-the-1974-auburn-mississippi-state-game-that-led-to-cow-bell-ban/#.VDvVAOfOSDo|title=Former AU quarterback Phil Gargis talks about the 1974 Auburn-Mississippi State game that led to cowbell ban|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> Jordan's dislike for the cowbells inspired Alabama to attempt to purchase 1,000 cowbells from Mississippi State for Alabama fans to take to the Iron Bowl; MSU declined the offer.<ref name=\"thewareaglereader1974\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/the-university-of-alabama-tried-to-buy-1000-cowbells-to-bring-to-the-1974-iron-bowl-texas-fans-took-them-to-annoy-auburn-at-the-gator-bowl/#.VDvTZOfOSDo|title=The University of Alabama tried to buy 1,000 cowbells from Mississippi State to bring to the 1974 Iron Bowl; Texas fans took them to annoy Auburn at the Gator Bowl|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> University of Texas fans also attempted to annoy Jordan with cowbells during the 1974 Gator Bowl.<ref name=\"thewareaglereader1974\"/> Shortly after the ban was enacted, Mississippi State officials considered other items and devices to replace the cowbells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvQ_efOSDo|title=Mississippi State considered handheld mirrors, cow tails as replacement traditions when cowbells were banned in 1975|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013032138/http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvQ_efOSDo|archivedate=2014-10-13}}</ref> In 1981, a Mississippi State faculty member filed a suit against Auburn University and the Southeastern Conference that sought to have the rule declared unconstitutional after his cowbell was confiscated at the 1981 AU-MSU game at Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium.<ref>[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/09/mississippi-state-fan-sues-auburn-sec-over-confiscated-cowbell/#.VC_zu-fOSDo Mississippi State fan sues Auburn, SEC over confiscated cowbell; calls rule \u2018unconstitutional\u2019]: The War Eagle Reader</ref> Despite creative efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvVmufOSDo|title=Mississippi State considered handheld mirrors, cow tails as replacement traditions when cowbells were banned in 1975|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013032138/http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/mississippi-state-considered-handheld-mirrors-cowtails-as-replacement-traditions-when-cowbells-were-banned-in-1975/#.VDvVmufOSDo|archivedate=2014-10-13}}</ref> by MSU fans to circumvent the ruling and continue the tradition, the ban was in effect until 2010.\n\nThat spring, the 12 schools of the SEC agreed to a compromise on artificial noisemakers, acknowledging the role cowbells play in the history of Mississippi State University by amending the conference by-law. In the fall of 2010, on a one-year trial with specified restrictions, cowbells were permitted in Davis Wade Stadium for the first time in 36 years. And due to MSU fans' notable adherence to the rules outlined by the league, cowbells will continue to be allowed with similar restrictions in place. In 2012, the rule was made permanent by the SEC.\n\n===Maroon and white===\nMaroon and White are the distinctive colors of Mississippi State University athletic teams, dating back over a century to the very first football game ever played by the school's student-athletes.\n\nOn November 15, 1895, the first Mississippi A&M football team was preparing for a road trip to [[Jackson, Tennessee]]., to play Southern Baptist University (now called [[Union University]]) the following day. Since every college was supposed to have its own uniform colors, the A&M student body requested that the school's team select a suitable combination.\n\nConsidering making this choice an honor, the inaugural State team gave the privilege to team captain W.M. Matthews. Accounts report that without hesitation Matthews chose Maroon and White.\n\n== Recruiting ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\nMississippi State Bulldogs Football 247Sports team recruiting

It is a partial [[beltway]] around [[New York City]], serving the northern half of New Jersey and the counties of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in New York. I-287, which is signed north\u2013south in New Jersey and east\u2013west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township, New Jersey]], clockwise to the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) in [[Rye, New York]], for {{convert|98.72|mi|km|2}}.  Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater Township]], the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|U.S. Route&nbsp;202]] (US&nbsp;202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], I-287 turns east on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) and runs through Rockland County. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], I-287 splits from I-87 near [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and continues east through Westchester County on the '''Cross-Westchester Expressway''' until it reaches the New England Thruway. Within New Jersey, I-287 is maintained by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), and within New York, it is maintained by the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA).\n\nA bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as '''Interstate&nbsp;187''', opened in 1960 as '''Interstate&nbsp;487''' before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the '''Middlesex Freeway'''. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US&nbsp;202 in [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]] opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder was completed by 1994. The aging [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] was replaced with a [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|new span]] which opened in stages between 2017 and 2018.\n\nA [[Long Island Sound link|proposed tunnel]] across the [[Long Island Sound]] between Rye and [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]] on [[Long Island]] would link the eastern terminus of I-287 to [[New York State Route&nbsp;25]] (NY&nbsp;25) and [[New York State Route 135|NY&nbsp;135]] in [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]].\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=fhwa />}}\n|-\n|[[New Jersey|NJ]] || 67.54 || 108.70\n|-\n|[[New York (state)|NY]] || 31.18 || 50.18\n|-\n|'''Total''' || 98.72 || 158.87\n|}\n\n===New Jersey===\n\n====Middlesex County====\n[[File:2018-05-20 15 20 25 View south along Interstate 287 (Middlesex Freeway) at Exit 3 (Middlesex County Route 501, New Durham Road, New Durham, Metuchen) in Edison Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|View south along I-287 at Exit 3 (CR 501) in Edison]]\nI-287 begins at an interchange with the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]] in  [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], where the freeway continues east as [[New Jersey Route 440|Route&nbsp;440]] towards [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]] and [[Staten Island]].<ref name=sld>{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/pdf/00000287__-.pdf|title=I-287 Straight Line Diagram|accessdate=March 17, 2020|format=PDF|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]}}</ref><ref name=gm>{{Google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=40.5285,+-74.336&daddr=I-287+N+to:41.023427,-74.245605+to:interstate+287+and+interstate+95+port+chester,+ny&geocode=FXRqagIdALmR-w%3BFSCwbgIdlveP-w%3B%3BFXtwcQIdCvSb-ylpOJeJTZfCiTG1zrvna6XvQA&hl=en&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=9&via=1,2&sll=40.75558,-74.012146&sspn=0.867569,2.694397&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=9|title=overview of Interstate 287|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> Within Middlesex County, I-287 is called the Lt.

It is a partial [[beltway]] around [[New York City]], serving the northern half of New Jersey and the counties of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in New York. I-287, which is signed north\u2013south in New Jersey and east\u2013west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township, New Jersey]], clockwise to the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) in [[Rye, New York]], for {{convert|98.72|mi|km|2}}.  Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater Township]], the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|U.S. Route&nbsp;202]] (US&nbsp;202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], I-287 turns east on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) and runs through Rockland County. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], I-287 splits from I-87 near [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and continues east through Westchester County on the '''Cross-Westchester Expressway''' until it reaches the New England Thruway. Within New Jersey, I-287 is maintained by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), and within New York, it is maintained by the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA).\n\nA bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as '''Interstate&nbsp;187''', opened in 1960 as '''Interstate&nbsp;487''' before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the '''Middlesex Freeway'''. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US&nbsp;202 in [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]] opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder was completed by 1994.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record. The first decade of his tenure was underscored by a fierce competition with his former mentor, [[Woody Hayes]], whose [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] squared off against Schembechler's Wolverines in a stretch of the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry dubbed the \"Ten-Year War\".\n\nFollowing Schembechler's retirement, the program was coached by two of his former assistants, [[Gary Moeller]] and then [[Lloyd Carr]], who maintained the program's overall success over the next 18 years. However, the program's fortunes declined under the next two coaches, [[Rich Rodriguez]] and [[Brady Hoke]], who were both fired after relatively short tenures.  Following Hoke's dismissal, Michigan hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] on December 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|title=Michigan Hires Jim Harbaugh as New Head Coach|first=Molly Geary and Scooby Axson / Sports|last=Illustrated|website=Time|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033514/https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Harbaugh is a former [[quarterback]] of the team, having played for Michigan between [[1982 Michigan Wolverines football team|1982]] and [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]] under Schembechler.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have featured 83 players that have garnered consensus selection to the [[College Football All-America Team]].

Rodriguez, a proponent of the [[spread offense]], installed it in place of the [[pro-style offense]] that had been used by Carr. The offseason saw significant attrition in Michigan's roster. The expected starting quarterback [[Ryan Mallett]] departed the program, stating that he would be unable to fit in a spread offense. Starting wide receivers [[Mario Manningham]] and [[Adrian Arrington]] both decided to forgo their senior seasons and enter the [[NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3188170|title=Quarterback Mallett leaves Michigan, is considering transfer to Tennessee|publisher=ESPN|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=December 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102123202/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3188170|archive-date=November 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Michigan lost a good deal of its depth and, when the 2008 season began, was forced to start players with very little playing experience.\n\nThe [[2008 Michigan Wolverines football team|2008 season]] was disappointing for Michigan, finishing at 3\u20139 and suffering its first losing campaign since 1967.  Michigan also missed a bowl game invitation for the first time since 1974. For the [[2009 Michigan Wolverines football team|2009 season]] the team saw many changes from the previous year.

The season ended in disappointment, however, as Michigan went 1\u20137 in its last eight games and missed a bowl for the second straight season.\n\nRodriguez's [[2010 Michigan Wolverines football team|final season]] began with new hope in the program, as Robinson was named the starting quarterback over Forcier. Robinson led the Wolverines to a 5\u20130 start, but after a defeat to [[2010 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] at home, the Wolverines finished the season 2\u20135 over their last seven games. Michigan did, however, qualify for a bowl game with a 7\u20135 record, and clinched its bowl berth in dramatic fashion against [[2010 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], with Michigan winning 67\u201365 in three overtime periods.

In his first season, Hoke led the Wolverines to 11 wins, beating rival [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] with a spectacular comeback in Michigan's first night game at [[Michigan Stadium]]. Despite losing to [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] and [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], the Wolverines finished with a 10\u20132 regular season record with their first win over Ohio State in eight years. The Wolverines received an invitation to the [[2012 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] in which they defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], 23\u201320, in overtime. This was the program's first bowl win since the season of 2007. Until the streak was broken in 2008, Michigan had appeared in a bowl game each year since the 1975 season.\n\nIn Hoke's second season, he led Michigan to an 8\u20135 record. The Wolverines dropped their season opener to eventual national champions, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] in Dallas, Texas. U-M won the next two games at home in non-conference bouts against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] and [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]], totaling 94 points over the two games. Michigan then traveled to face eventual national runner-up [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. In this game, the Wolverines committed six turnovers, including five interceptions, as they fell to the Fighting Irish by a 13\u20136 final. After back-to-back wins over [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]], they defeated in-state rival [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the first time since 2007. The win was the 900th in program history, becoming the first program to reach the milestone. U-M finished the season with wins over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] as well as losses to [[2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] to finish the regular season.

Ohio State's 62 points set a record for points against Michigan during regulation.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record. The first decade of his tenure was underscored by a fierce competition with his former mentor, [[Woody Hayes]], whose [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] squared off against Schembechler's Wolverines in a stretch of the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry dubbed the \"Ten-Year War\".\n\nFollowing Schembechler's retirement, the program was coached by two of his former assistants, [[Gary Moeller]] and then [[Lloyd Carr]], who maintained the program's overall success over the next 18 years. However, the program's fortunes declined under the next two coaches, [[Rich Rodriguez]] and [[Brady Hoke]], who were both fired after relatively short tenures.  Following Hoke's dismissal, Michigan hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] on December 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|title=Michigan Hires Jim Harbaugh as New Head Coach|first=Molly Geary and Scooby Axson / Sports|last=Illustrated|website=Time|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033514/https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Harbaugh is a former [[quarterback]] of the team, having played for Michigan between [[1982 Michigan Wolverines football team|1982]] and [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]] under Schembechler.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have featured 83 players that have garnered consensus selection to the [[College Football All-America Team]]. Three Wolverines have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]: [[Tom Harmon]] in 1940, [[Desmond Howard]] in 1991, and [[Charles Woodson]] in 1997.

The Wolverines received an invitation to the [[2012 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] in which they defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], 23\u201320, in overtime. This was the program's first bowl win since the season of 2007. Until the streak was broken in 2008, Michigan had appeared in a bowl game each year since the 1975 season.\n\nIn Hoke's second season, he led Michigan to an 8\u20135 record. The Wolverines dropped their season opener to eventual national champions, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] in Dallas, Texas. U-M won the next two games at home in non-conference bouts against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] and [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]], totaling 94 points over the two games. Michigan then traveled to face eventual national runner-up [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. In this game, the Wolverines committed six turnovers, including five interceptions, as they fell to the Fighting Irish by a 13\u20136 final. After back-to-back wins over [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]], they defeated in-state rival [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the first time since 2007. The win was the 900th in program history, becoming the first program to reach the milestone. U-M finished the season with wins over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] as well as losses to [[2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] to finish the regular season.

I|Wide Right II}}\nThe [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] rivalry dates to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35\u201313 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played every year since 1966, with Miami holding the all-time advantage, 33\u201330. Upon the conclusion of their 2003 regular-season schedules, the teams represented their respective conferences in the 2004 [[FedEx Orange Bowl]] (Miami being the champions of the Big East, and Florida State being the champions of the ACC). Miami won the bowl game 16\u201314; it was the only time the schools have met in post-season football play. The 63 meetings between the teams of FSU and Miami eclipsed the rivalry between the Hurricanes and the Gators (from the [[University of Florida]]) following their 2010 game; the series of games between UM and Florida is Miami's second-longest at 55 games.\n\nDuring the 1980s and '90s, the series emerged as one of the premier rivalries in college football.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Between 1983 and 2002, the Hurricanes and Seminoles combined to win 7 national championships and play in 14 bowl games with a national championship at stake. The 1988 game starred 57 future [[National Football League|NFL]] pros on the combined rosters. Since 2004, the year Miami left the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] to join the expanded 12-member [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], the universities have been conference foes, though they are placed in separate divisions within the conference. This alignment creates the potential for the two teams to meet for a second time in the [[ACC Championship Game]], should each win their respective divisions in any particular season. Such a rematch has yet to happen after 14 years of ACC Championship Games, as of 2018.\n\nThe series has consistently drawn very high [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] with the 2006 Miami\u2013Florida State game being the most-watched college football game\u2014regular-season or postseason\u2014in [[ESPN]] history, and the 2009 and 1994 meetings being the second- and fifth-most watched regular season games, respectively.<ref name=\"ratings\">{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/1226762.html|title=ESPN viewers flocked to Miami Hurricanes\u2013FSU matchup|last=Miller Degnan|first=Susan|date=September 10, 2009|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes lead the all-time series 33\u201330.

The two schools met every year from 1944 until 1987, but have not played regularly since then. Florida canceled the annual series after the 1987 season,<ref name=\"florida rivalry1\"/><ref name=\"florida rivalry2\"/> when the requirement of the [[Southeastern Conference]] for member schools to play eight conference games induced the University of Florida to fill out the non-conference portion of its schedule with teams that do not require a home-and-home arrangement,<ref name=\"florida rivalry2\"/> except for Florida State.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2003, Miami won all six of the games between the schools, including victories in the 2001 [[Sugar Bowl]] and the 2004 [[Peach Bowl]]. Florida snapped its 23-year drought against Miami with a 26\u20133 win over the Hurricanes in 2008.

The cannon is kept by the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity's Cannon Master and fired off during the games by the senior brothers of Sigma Chi. Touchdown Tommy is the third oldest tradition at the University of Miami, after the [[Iron Arrow Honor Society]] and [[Sebastian the Ibis]].\n\n===The Smoke===\nOne of the Hurricanes' best-known traditions is the team's entrance scene. The team enters the field through a large cloud of white smoke billowing from its entrance tunnel, amid a tape of a hurricane blasting over the sound system. The smoke comes from fire extinguisher exhaust that billows from a series of pipes welded together by school transportation director Bob Nalette in the 1950s. The pipes were moved to Sun Life Stadium when the Hurricanes moved there in 2008.\n\nFollowing Miami's rise to prominence in the 1980s, many high school, college and [[National Football League|NFL]] teams over the last 25 years have copied this practice, and in 2001 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] made a parody of it for a Saturday college football commercial.\n\n===Ring of Honor===\nIn 1997, the university established the 'Ring of Honor' as a way to honor outstanding players who have passed through the Hurricane football program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011400aac.html|title=The Ring Of Honor|accessdate=December 2, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209065702/http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011400aac.html|archivedate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> Members are selected by an anonymous advisory committee, the director of athletics and the head football coach.<ref>[http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092508aad.html Retrieved 2009-12-12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325034330/http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092508aad.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref> The names and jersey numbers of the inductees were displayed on the upper deck of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] (which has since been torn down).

I|Wide Right II}}\nThe [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] rivalry dates to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35\u201313 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played every year since 1966, with Miami holding the all-time advantage, 33\u201330. Upon the conclusion of their 2003 regular-season schedules, the teams represented their respective conferences in the 2004 [[FedEx Orange Bowl]] (Miami being the champions of the Big East, and Florida State being the champions of the ACC). Miami won the bowl game 16\u201314; it was the only time the schools have met in post-season football play. The 63 meetings between the teams of FSU and Miami eclipsed the rivalry between the Hurricanes and the Gators (from the [[University of Florida]]) following their 2010 game; the series of games between UM and Florida is Miami's second-longest at 55 games.\n\nDuring the 1980s and '90s, the series emerged as one of the premier rivalries in college football.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Between 1983 and 2002, the Hurricanes and Seminoles combined to win 7 national championships and play in 14 bowl games with a national championship at stake. The 1988 game starred 57 future [[National Football League|NFL]] pros on the combined rosters. Since 2004, the year Miami left the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] to join the expanded 12-member [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], the universities have been conference foes, though they are placed in separate divisions within the conference. This alignment creates the potential for the two teams to meet for a second time in the [[ACC Championship Game]], should each win their respective divisions in any particular season. Such a rematch has yet to happen after 14 years of ACC Championship Games, as of 2018.\n\nThe series has consistently drawn very high [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] with the 2006 Miami\u2013Florida State game being the most-watched college football game\u2014regular-season or postseason\u2014in [[ESPN]] history, and the 2009 and 1994 meetings being the second- and fifth-most watched regular season games, respectively.<ref name=\"ratings\">{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/1226762.html|title=ESPN viewers flocked to Miami Hurricanes\u2013FSU matchup|last=Miller Degnan|first=Susan|date=September 10, 2009|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes lead the all-time series 33\u201330.

The two schools met every year from 1944 until 1987, but have not played regularly since then. Florida canceled the annual series after the 1987 season,<ref name=\"florida rivalry1\"/><ref name=\"florida rivalry2\"/> when the requirement of the [[Southeastern Conference]] for member schools to play eight conference games induced the University of Florida to fill out the non-conference portion of its schedule with teams that do not require a home-and-home arrangement,<ref name=\"florida rivalry2\"/> except for Florida State.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2003, Miami won all six of the games between the schools, including victories in the 2001 [[Sugar Bowl]] and the 2004 [[Peach Bowl]]. Florida snapped its 23-year drought against Miami with a 26\u20133 win over the Hurricanes in 2008.

The cannon is kept by the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity's Cannon Master and fired off during the games by the senior brothers of Sigma Chi. Touchdown Tommy is the third oldest tradition at the University of Miami, after the [[Iron Arrow Honor Society]] and [[Sebastian the Ibis]].\n\n===The Smoke===\nOne of the Hurricanes' best-known traditions is the team's entrance scene. The team enters the field through a large cloud of white smoke billowing from its entrance tunnel, amid a tape of a hurricane blasting over the sound system. The smoke comes from fire extinguisher exhaust that billows from a series of pipes welded together by school transportation director Bob Nalette in the 1950s. The pipes were moved to Sun Life Stadium when the Hurricanes moved there in 2008.\n\nFollowing Miami's rise to prominence in the 1980s, many high school, college and [[National Football League|NFL]] teams over the last 25 years have copied this practice, and in 2001 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] made a parody of it for a Saturday college football commercial.\n\n===Ring of Honor===\nIn 1997, the university established the 'Ring of Honor' as a way to honor outstanding players who have passed through the Hurricane football program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011400aac.html|title=The Ring Of Honor|accessdate=December 2, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209065702/http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011400aac.html|archivedate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> Members are selected by an anonymous advisory committee, the director of athletics and the head football coach.<ref>[http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092508aad.html Retrieved 2009-12-12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325034330/http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092508aad.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref> The names and jersey numbers of the inductees were displayed on the upper deck of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] (which has since been torn down).

His ambitions did not stop with spinning. While he continued to play in the clubs sometimes five nights a week, he became a dance music journalist by day.
