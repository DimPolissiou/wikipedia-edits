The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder.\n\n''Hello, Dolly!'' first debuted at the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theater]] in Detroit on November 18, 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=5050|title=Hello, Dolly! - 1964 Broadway - Backstage & Production Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>, directed and choreographed by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by [[David Merrick]], and moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. This set a record which the play held for 37 years. The show album ''Hello, Dolly!

''Top Pop Albums'' (2010), Record Research, {{ISBN|0-89820-183-7}}, p.973</ref> [[Louis Armstrong]] also was featured in the film version of the show, performing a small part of the song \"Hello, Dolly!\".\n\nThe show has become one of the most enduring musical theater hits, with four Broadway revivals and international success. It was also made into the 1969 film ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]]. However, the 1891 musical ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' also features a meddlesome widow who strives to bring romance to several couples and to herself in a big city restaurant.<ref>Saltzman, Simon.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder.\n\n''Hello, Dolly!'' first debuted at the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theater]] in Detroit on November 18, 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=5050|title=Hello, Dolly! - 1964 Broadway - Backstage & Production Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>, directed and choreographed by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by [[David Merrick]], and moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

It was also made into the 1969 film ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]].

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].\n\nEarly poems in the [[Eurasia]]n continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese [[Classic of Poetry|''Shijing'']]; or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]], and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[line (poetry)|verse form]], and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative [[prosaic]] writing.\n\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke [[emotion|emotive]] responses. Devices such as [[assonance]], [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]], and [[rhythm]] may convey [[music]]al or [[incantation|incantatory]] effects. The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]], and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, figures of speech such as [[metaphor]], [[simile]], and [[metonymy]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Strachan, John R |title=Poetry: an introduction |last2=Terry, Richard, G |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8147-9797-6 |page=119}}</ref> establish a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived.

Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sch\u00fclter, Julia |title=Rhythmic Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2005 |pages=24, 304, 332}}</ref> Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yip, Moira |title=Tone |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-77314-0 |series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics |pages=1\u20134, 130}}</ref>\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}</ref> In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jorgens |first=Elise Bickford |title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597\u20131651 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7 |page=23}}</ref> [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]\nThe chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker-Jones |first=Arthur |title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58983-086-8 |pages=211\u201313}}</ref> Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bala Sundara Raman |first=L |last2=Ishwar, S |last3=Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth |year=2003 |title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry |journal=Tamil Internet |pages=128\u201336 |citeseerx=10.1.1.3.7738}}</ref>\n\n[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (\u5e73 ''p\u00edng'') tone and the oblique (\u4ec4 ''z\u00e8'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (\u4e0a ''sh\u00e1ng'') tone, the departing (\u53bb ''q\u00f9'') tone and the entering (\u5165 ''r\u00f9'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed constraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.\n\nThe formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=[[Bollingen Foundation]] |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 9\u201313]}}</ref>\n\n==== Metrical patterns ====\n[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) is mainly in [[anapestic tetrameter]].]]\n{{Main|Meter (poetry)}}\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=Bollingen Foundation |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 46\u201347]}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}</ref>\n* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}</ref>\n* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], \"[[To His Coy Mistress]]\"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')<ref name=\"tetra\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tetrameter.com |title=What is Tetrameter? |publisher=tetrameter.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic octameter]] ([[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"[[The Raven]]\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=60}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''; the Finnish national epic, ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)\n* {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}} ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Ph\u00e8dre]]'')<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=ED |url=https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame |title=Racine: Ph\u00e8dre |last2=Jondorf, G |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-39721-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame/page/32 32\u201334] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]\n{{Main|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}</ref> A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minta, Stephen |url=https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 |title=Petrarch and Petrarchism |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-7190-0748-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 15\u201317]}}</ref> The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.\n\n=== Shi ===\n[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], \"On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]\"]]\n{{Main|Shi (poetry)}}\n\n''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u8a69|\u8a69]]|s=[[wikt:\u8bd7|\u8bd7]]|p=sh\u012b|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Faurot |first=Jeannette L |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 |title=Drinking with the moon |publisher=China Books & Periodicals |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yugen |date=1 June 2004 |title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse |journal=T'ang Studies |volume=2004 |issue=22 |pages=81\u2013125 |doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}</ref> One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schirokauer |first=Conrad |title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-15-505569-8 |edition=2nd |page=119}}</ref>\n\n=== Villanelle ===\n[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.

The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gayley |first=Charles Mills |title=English Poetry |last2=Young, Clement C |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4179-0086-2 |edition=Reprint |page=lxxxv}}</ref> Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode.

Poems considered \"light\" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]], including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme and heavy [[alliteration]]. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English usually obeys at least some formal conventions.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way.

Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sch\u00fclter, Julia |title=Rhythmic Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2005 |pages=24, 304, 332}}</ref> Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yip, Moira |title=Tone |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-77314-0 |series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics |pages=1\u20134, 130}}</ref>\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}</ref> In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jorgens |first=Elise Bickford |title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597\u20131651 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7 |page=23}}</ref> [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]\nThe chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker-Jones |first=Arthur |title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58983-086-8 |pages=211\u201313}}</ref> Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bala Sundara Raman |first=L |last2=Ishwar, S |last3=Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth |year=2003 |title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry |journal=Tamil Internet |pages=128\u201336 |citeseerx=10.1.1.3.7738}}</ref>\n\n[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (\u5e73 ''p\u00edng'') tone and the oblique (\u4ec4 ''z\u00e8'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (\u4e0a ''sh\u00e1ng'') tone, the departing (\u53bb ''q\u00f9'') tone and the entering (\u5165 ''r\u00f9'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed constraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.\n\nThe formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=[[Bollingen Foundation]] |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 9\u201313]}}</ref>\n\n==== Metrical patterns ====\n[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) is mainly in [[anapestic tetrameter]].]]\n{{Main|Meter (poetry)}}\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=Bollingen Foundation |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 46\u201347]}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}</ref>\n* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}</ref>\n* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], \"[[To His Coy Mistress]]\"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')<ref name=\"tetra\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tetrameter.com |title=What is Tetrameter? |publisher=tetrameter.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic octameter]] ([[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"[[The Raven]]\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=60}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''; the Finnish national epic, ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)\n* {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}} ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Ph\u00e8dre]]'')<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=ED |url=https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame |title=Racine: Ph\u00e8dre |last2=Jondorf, G |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-39721-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame/page/32 32\u201334] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]\n{{Main|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}</ref> A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minta, Stephen |url=https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 |title=Petrarch and Petrarchism |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-7190-0748-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 15\u201317]}}</ref> The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Faurot |first=Jeannette L |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 |title=Drinking with the moon |publisher=China Books & Periodicals |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yugen |date=1 June 2004 |title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse |journal=T'ang Studies |volume=2004 |issue=22 |pages=81\u2013125 |doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}</ref> One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schirokauer |first=Conrad |title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-15-505569-8 |edition=2nd |page=119}}</ref>\n\n=== Villanelle ===\n[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.

The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.

Poems considered \"light\" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]], including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme and heavy [[alliteration]]. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English usually obeys at least some formal conventions.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned \"serious\" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Ogden Nash]], [[X. J. Kennedy]], [[Willard R.

It ranges from east of the [[Great Dividing Range|Great Divide]] in Queensland through coastal New South Wales, becoming scattered south to [[Jervis Bay]]. It also occurs in south-western Western Australia and from Israelite Bay, east of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]], to the Murchison River in [[Kalbarri National Park]].<ref name=Pizzey></ref>\n\nThe white-cheeked honeyeater is usually found in moist heathlands, as well as around paperbark swamps and wetlands, and in forests or woodlands with a heath understory.<ref name=Pizzey></ref> Occurring in both temperate and subtropical zones, they are found in parks, gardens and flowering street trees throughout their range.<ref name=Higgins></ref> Not afraid of humans and adapting easily to settlement activity, they are sometimes killed by cats.\n\n==Behaviour==\nMostly resident or sedentary, with some seasonal movement at edge of range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref>\n\n===Vocalization===\nThe white-cheeked honeyeater has a distinctive yapping call \"chwikup, chwikup\"; a melodious \"chippy-choo, chippy-choo\" and a higher, repeated lilting \"twee-ee-twee-ee\" call given in display song-flight during the breeding season.<ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Slater></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref>\n\n===Feeding===\nWhite-cheeked honeyeaters feed mainly on nectar from the flowers of ''[[Banksia]]'', [[eucalypt]], ''[[Grevillea]]'', [[Callistemon|bottlebrush]] and [[Epacris|heath]], and (in southwest Western Australia) ''[[Darwinia (plant)|Darwinia]]'', ''[[Calothamnus]]'' and ''[[Dryandra]]'' species.<ref name=Higgins></ref> They also glean insects on bark or sally and hover for them in the air.<ref name=Higgins></ref> They often feed busily and noisily in small groups and may feed beside New Holland honeyeaters.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nWhite-cheeked honeyeaters pair monogamously for the breeding season, which can be at any time of year coincident with nectar availability, though peaking from August to November and March to May.<ref name=Morcombe>Morcombe, Michael (2012) ''Field Guide to Australian Birds.'' Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. {{ISBN|978174021417-9}}</ref>  Males defend breeding territories that can be held for several years.

(eds) (2001) ''Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds, Volume 5 (Tyrant-flycatchers to Chats).'' Oxford University Press, Melbourne.</ref> There is not much competition between white-cheeked and New Holland honeyeaters, as they choose different perching sites and have different nesting seasons. The female builds a cup-shaped [[nest]] from twigs, strips of bark, and other plant materials,  bound with spider web, and lined with plant down and pieces of flowers.<ref name=Pizzey></ref> The nest is placed low in forked branches of trees or shrubs, often close to the ground, but well-concealed in dense foliage or in grass below shrubs and ferns. A clutch of 2 or 3 eggs, each measuring {{convert|21|x|15|mm|in|abbr=on}}, is laid.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> The eggs are whitish buff to pink, splotched with chestnut-red and slate-grey towards the large end.<ref name=Pizzey>Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) ''A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia''.

Historically, indigo was a [[natural dye]] extracted from the leaves of certain plants, and this process was important economically because blue dyes were once rare.  A large percentage of indigo [[dye]] produced today, several thousand tons each year, is [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]]. It is the blue often associated with [[denim]] cloth and  [[Jeans|blue jeans]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Indigo plant extract sample.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Indigo dye]]\nThe primary use for indigo is as a dye for cotton yarn, which is mainly for the production of denim cloth for blue jeans. On average, a pair of blue jean pants requires 3\u201312 g of indigo.  Small amounts are used for dyeing wool and silk.\n\n[[Indigo carmine]], or indigo, is an indigo derivative which is also used as a colorant. About 20 thousand tons are produced annually, again mainly for blue jeans.<ref name=Ullmann>Elmar Steingruber \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref> It is also used as a food colorant, and is listed in the United States as [[FD&C]] Blue No. 2.\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Natural sources===\nA variety of plants have provided indigo throughout history, but most natural indigo was obtained from those in the genus ''[[Indigofera]]'', which are native to the [[tropics]], notably the Indian subcontinent.  The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'', also known as ''I. sumatrana''). A common alternative used in the relatively colder subtropical locations such as Japan's Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan is ''[[Strobilanthes|Strobilanthes cusia]]''. [[Polygonum tinctorum|Dyer's knotweed]] (''Polygonum tinctorum'') was the most important blue dye in East Asia until the arrival of the ''Indigofera'' species from the south, which yield more dye. In [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the species grown is ''[[Indigofera suffruticosa|anil]]''. In Europe [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] containing the same dye was used for blue-dying. Several plants contain indigo, but low concentrations make them difficult to work with and the color is then more easily tainted by other dye substances, typically leading to a greenish tinge.\n\nThe precursor to indigo is [[indican]], a colorless, water-soluble derivative of the amino acid [[tryptophan]].  Indican readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] to release \u03b2-D-[[glucose]] and [[indoxyl]]. [[Oxidation]] by exposure to air converts indoxyl to indigotin, the insoluble blue chemical that is the endpoint of indigo dye. Indican was obtained from the processing of the plant's leaves, which contain as much as 0.2\u20130.8% of this compound. The leaves were soaked in water and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] to convert the [[glycoside]] indican present in the plant to the blue dye '''indigotin'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schorlemmer|first=Carl|authorlink= Carl Schorlemmer|title=A Manual of the Chemistry of the Carbon compounds; or, Organic Chemistry|url=https://archive.org/details/amanualchemistr02schogoog|location=London|year=1874}} Quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition, 1989</ref> They precipitate from the fermented leaf solution when mixed with a strong base<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coyuchi.com/the-naturalista/indigo_dyeing/|title=Indigo Dyeing|website=Coyuchi Inc.|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> such as [[sodium hydroxide|lye]], pressed into cakes, dried, and powdered. The powder was then mixed with various other substances to produce different shades of blue and purple.\n\n{{see also|#Indigo derivatives}}\nNatural sources also include mollusks. The [[Murex]] sea snails produce a mixture of indigo and 6,6'-dibromoindigo (red) which together produce a range of purple hues known as [[Tyrian purple]]. Light exposure during part of the dying process can convert the dibromoindigo into indigo resulting in blue hues known as royal blue, hyacinth purple, or [[tekhelet]].\n\n===Chemical synthesis===\n{{multiple images|direction=vertical|width=330\n|image1=Indigo.Baeyer-Drewson.Synthesis.png|caption1=Heumann's synthesis of indigo\n|image2=Indigo Synthesis V.1.svg|caption2=Pfleger's synthesis of indigo}}\nGiven its economic importance, indigo has been prepared by many methods. The [[Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis]] dates back to 1882. It involves an aldol condensation of o-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone, followed by cyclization and oxidative dimerization to indigo. This route is highly useful for obtaining indigo and many of its derivatives on the laboratory scale, but was impractical for industrial-scale synthesis. Johannes Pfleger<ref name=\"history.evonik.com\"/> and [[Karl Heumann]] ([[:de:Karl Heumann|de]]) eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis.<ref name=\"ingenious.org.uk\"/> The first commercially practical route is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, [[N-Phenylglycine|''N''-phenylglycine]] is treated with a molten mixture of  [[sodium hydroxide]], [[potassium hydroxide]], and [[sodamide]]. This highly sensitive melt produces [[indoxyl]], which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo.  Variations of this method are still in use today.  An alternative and also viable route to indigo is credited to Heumann in 1897.  It involves heating ''N''-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine to {{convert|200|C}} in an inert atmosphere with sodium hydroxide. The process is easier than the Pfleger method, but the precursors are more expensive.  Indoxyl-2-carboxylic acid is generated.  This material readily decarboxylates to give indoxyl, which oxidizes in air to form indigo.<ref name=Ullmann/>  The preparation of indigo dye is practiced in college laboratory classes according to the original Baeyer-Drewsen route.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McKee | first1 = James R. | last2 = Zanger | first2 = Murray | year = 1991 | title = A microscale synthesis of indigo: Vat dyeing | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 68 | issue = 10| page = A242 | doi = 10.1021/ed068pA242 | bibcode = 1991JChEd..68..242M }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Indigo-Historische Farbstoffsammlung.jpg|thumb|right| Indigo, historical dye collection of the [[Dresden University of Technology|Technical University of Dresden]], Germany]]\nIndigo is among the oldest dyes to be used for textile dyeing and printing.

The Romans used indigo as a pigment for painting and for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. It was a luxury item imported to the Mediterranean from India by Arab merchants.\n\nIndigo remained a rare commodity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. A chemically identical dye derived from the woad plant ''([[Isatis tinctoria]])'' was used instead.  In the late 15th century, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route to India. This led to the establishment of direct trade with India, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], China, and Japan. Importers could now avoid the heavy duties imposed by [[Iran|Persia]]n, [[Levant]]ine, and Greek middlemen and the lengthy and dangerous land routes which had previously been used. Consequently, the importation and use of indigo in Europe rose significantly. Much European indigo from Asia arrived through ports in Portugal, the Netherlands, and England. Many indigo plantations were established by European powers in tropical climates. Spain imported the dye from its colonies in South America, and it was a major crop in [[Haiti]] and Jamaica, with much or all of the labor performed by enslaved Africans and African Americans. In the Spanish colonial era, intensive production of indigo for the world market in the region of modern El Salvador entailed such unhealthy conditions that the local indigenous population, forced to labor in pestilential conditions, was decimated.<ref>Fowler, Walter (6 August 1991). ''The Formation of Complex Society in Southeastern Mesoamerica''. CRC Press.</ref> Indigo plantations also thrived in the [[Virgin Islands]]. However, France and Germany outlawed imported indigo in the 16th century to protect the local woad dye industry.\n\n[[File:Targui.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Man wearing an indigo-dyed [[tagelmust]]]]\nIndigo was the foundation of centuries-old textile traditions throughout West Africa.

To be dissolved, it must undergo a chemical change ([[Redox|reduction]]).  Reduction converts indigo into \"white indigo\" ([[leuco dye|leuco]]-indigo).  When a submerged fabric is removed from the dyebath, the white indigo quickly combines with [[oxygen]] in the air and reverts to the insoluble, intensely colored indigo. When it first became widely available in Europe in the 16th century, European dyers and printers struggled with indigo because of this distinctive property. It also required several chemical manipulations, some involving toxic materials, and had many opportunities to injure workers.  In the 19th century, English poet [[William Wordsworth]] referred to the plight of indigo dye workers of his hometown of Cockermouth in his autobiographical poem ''The Prelude''.  Speaking of their dire working conditions and the empathy that he felt for them, he wrote:\n:Doubtless, I should have then made common cause\n:With some who perished; haply perished too\n:A poor mistaken and bewildered offering\n:Unknown to those bare souls of miller blue\n\nA pre-industrial process for production of indigo white, used in Europe, was to dissolve the indigo in stale urine, which contains ammonia.  A more convenient reductive agent is zinc. Another pre-industrial method, used in Japan, was to dissolve the indigo in a heated vat in which a culture of [[thermophile|thermophilic]], [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] bacteria was maintained. Some species of such bacteria generate [[hydrogen]] as a metabolic product, which  convert insoluble indigo into soluble indigo white. Cloth dyed in such a vat was decorated with the techniques of ''[[shibori]]'' (tie-dye), ''[[kasuri]], [[katazome]]'', and ''[[tsutsugaki]]''. Examples of clothing and banners dyed with these techniques can be seen in the works of [[Hokusai]] and other artists.\n\n===Direct printing===\nTwo different methods for the direct application of indigo were developed in England in the 18th century and remained in use well into the 19th century. The first method, known as 'pencil blue' because it was most often applied by pencil or brush, could be used to achieve dark hues. [[Arsenic trisulfide]] and a thickener were added to the indigo vat. The arsenic compound delayed the oxidation of the indigo long enough to paint the dye onto fabrics.\n\n[[File:IndigoDyePotOnStove.JPG|thumb|Pot of freeze-dried indigo dye]]\nThe second method was known as 'China blue' due to its resemblance to Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Instead of using an indigo solution directly, the process involved printing the insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric. The indigo was then reduced in a sequence of baths of [[iron(II) sulfate]], with air-oxidation between each immersion. The China blue process could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues possible with the pencil blue method.\n\nAround 1880, the 'glucose process' was developed. It finally enabled the direct printing of indigo onto fabric and could produce inexpensive dark indigo prints unattainable with the China blue method.\n\nSince 2004, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] indigo, or instant indigo, has become available. In this method, the indigo has already been reduced, and then freeze-dried into a crystal. The crystals are added to warm water to create the dye pot. As in a standard indigo dye pot, care has to be taken to avoid mixing in oxygen. Freeze-dried indigo is simple to use, and the crystals can be stored indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to moisture.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |title=Directions for Instant Indigo |author=Judith McKenzie McCuin |access-date=2008-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041116195957/http://paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |archive-date=2004-11-16}}</ref>\n\n==Chemical properties==\n[[File:Indigo3D.png|thumb|170px|Indigo, space-filling]]\nIndigo dye is a dark blue crystalline powder that [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] at {{convert|390|\u2013|392|C}}.

Historically, indigo was a [[natural dye]] extracted from the leaves of certain plants, and this process was important economically because blue dyes were once rare.  A large percentage of indigo [[dye]] produced today, several thousand tons each year, is [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]]. It is the blue often associated with [[denim]] cloth and  [[Jeans|blue jeans]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Indigo plant extract sample.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Indigo dye]]\nThe primary use for indigo is as a dye for cotton yarn, which is mainly for the production of denim cloth for blue jeans. On average, a pair of blue jean pants requires 3\u201312 g of indigo.  Small amounts are used for dyeing wool and silk.\n\n[[Indigo carmine]], or indigo, is an indigo derivative which is also used as a colorant. About 20 thousand tons are produced annually, again mainly for blue jeans.<ref name=Ullmann>Elmar Steingruber \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref> It is also used as a food colorant, and is listed in the United States as [[FD&C]] Blue No. 2.\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Natural sources===\nA variety of plants have provided indigo throughout history, but most natural indigo was obtained from those in the genus ''[[Indigofera]]'', which are native to the [[tropics]], notably the Indian subcontinent.  The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'', also known as ''I. sumatrana''). A common alternative used in the relatively colder subtropical locations such as Japan's Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan is ''[[Strobilanthes|Strobilanthes cusia]]''. [[Polygonum tinctorum|Dyer's knotweed]] (''Polygonum tinctorum'') was the most important blue dye in East Asia until the arrival of the ''Indigofera'' species from the south, which yield more dye. In [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the species grown is ''[[Indigofera suffruticosa|anil]]''. In Europe [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] containing the same dye was used for blue-dying. Several plants contain indigo, but low concentrations make them difficult to work with and the color is then more easily tainted by other dye substances, typically leading to a greenish tinge.\n\nThe precursor to indigo is [[indican]], a colorless, water-soluble derivative of the amino acid [[tryptophan]].  Indican readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] to release \u03b2-D-[[glucose]] and [[indoxyl]]. [[Oxidation]] by exposure to air converts indoxyl to indigotin, the insoluble blue chemical that is the endpoint of indigo dye. Indican was obtained from the processing of the plant's leaves, which contain as much as 0.2\u20130.8% of this compound. The leaves were soaked in water and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] to convert the [[glycoside]] indican present in the plant to the blue dye '''indigotin'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schorlemmer|first=Carl|authorlink= Carl Schorlemmer|title=A Manual of the Chemistry of the Carbon compounds; or, Organic Chemistry|url=https://archive.org/details/amanualchemistr02schogoog|location=London|year=1874}} Quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition, 1989</ref> They precipitate from the fermented leaf solution when mixed with a strong base<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coyuchi.com/the-naturalista/indigo_dyeing/|title=Indigo Dyeing|website=Coyuchi Inc.|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> such as [[sodium hydroxide|lye]], pressed into cakes, dried, and powdered. The powder was then mixed with various other substances to produce different shades of blue and purple.\n\n{{see also|#Indigo derivatives}}\nNatural sources also include mollusks. The [[Murex]] sea snails produce a mixture of indigo and 6,6'-dibromoindigo (red) which together produce a range of purple hues known as [[Tyrian purple]]. Light exposure during part of the dying process can convert the dibromoindigo into indigo resulting in blue hues known as royal blue, hyacinth purple, or [[tekhelet]].\n\n===Chemical synthesis===\n{{multiple images|direction=vertical|width=330\n|image1=Indigo.Baeyer-Drewson.Synthesis.png|caption1=Heumann's synthesis of indigo\n|image2=Indigo Synthesis V.1.svg|caption2=Pfleger's synthesis of indigo}}\nGiven its economic importance, indigo has been prepared by many methods. The [[Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis]] dates back to 1882. It involves an aldol condensation of o-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone, followed by cyclization and oxidative dimerization to indigo. This route is highly useful for obtaining indigo and many of its derivatives on the laboratory scale, but was impractical for industrial-scale synthesis. Johannes Pfleger<ref name=\"history.evonik.com\"/> and [[Karl Heumann]] ([[:de:Karl Heumann|de]]) eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis.<ref name=\"ingenious.org.uk\"/> The first commercially practical route is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, [[N-Phenylglycine|''N''-phenylglycine]] is treated with a molten mixture of  [[sodium hydroxide]], [[potassium hydroxide]], and [[sodamide]]. This highly sensitive melt produces [[indoxyl]], which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo.  Variations of this method are still in use today.  An alternative and also viable route to indigo is credited to Heumann in 1897.  It involves heating ''N''-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine to {{convert|200|C}} in an inert atmosphere with sodium hydroxide. The process is easier than the Pfleger method, but the precursors are more expensive.  Indoxyl-2-carboxylic acid is generated.  This material readily decarboxylates to give indoxyl, which oxidizes in air to form indigo.<ref name=Ullmann/>  The preparation of indigo dye is practiced in college laboratory classes according to the original Baeyer-Drewsen route.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McKee | first1 = James R. | last2 = Zanger | first2 = Murray | year = 1991 | title = A microscale synthesis of indigo: Vat dyeing | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 68 | issue = 10| page = A242 | doi = 10.1021/ed068pA242 | bibcode = 1991JChEd..68..242M }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Indigo-Historische Farbstoffsammlung.jpg|thumb|right| Indigo, historical dye collection of the [[Dresden University of Technology|Technical University of Dresden]], Germany]]\nIndigo is among the oldest dyes to be used for textile dyeing and printing.

The Romans used indigo as a pigment for painting and for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. It was a luxury item imported to the Mediterranean from India by Arab merchants.\n\nIndigo remained a rare commodity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. A chemically identical dye derived from the woad plant ''([[Isatis tinctoria]])'' was used instead.  In the late 15th century, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route to India. This led to the establishment of direct trade with India, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], China, and Japan. Importers could now avoid the heavy duties imposed by [[Iran|Persia]]n, [[Levant]]ine, and Greek middlemen and the lengthy and dangerous land routes which had previously been used. Consequently, the importation and use of indigo in Europe rose significantly. Much European indigo from Asia arrived through ports in Portugal, the Netherlands, and England. Many indigo plantations were established by European powers in tropical climates. Spain imported the dye from its colonies in South America, and it was a major crop in [[Haiti]] and Jamaica, with much or all of the labor performed by enslaved Africans and African Americans. In the Spanish colonial era, intensive production of indigo for the world market in the region of modern El Salvador entailed such unhealthy conditions that the local indigenous population, forced to labor in pestilential conditions, was decimated.<ref>Fowler, Walter (6 August 1991). ''The Formation of Complex Society in Southeastern Mesoamerica''. CRC Press.</ref> Indigo plantations also thrived in the [[Virgin Islands]]. However, France and Germany outlawed imported indigo in the 16th century to protect the local woad dye industry.\n\n[[File:Targui.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Man wearing an indigo-dyed [[tagelmust]]]]\nIndigo was the foundation of centuries-old textile traditions throughout West Africa.

He described his first synthesis of indigo in 1878 (from [[isatin]]) and a second synthesis in 1880 (from [[2-nitrobenzaldehyde]]).  (It was not until 1883 that Baeyer finally determined the structure of indigo.<ref>Adolf Baeyer (1883) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90697p/f512.image.langEN \"Ueber die Verbindungen der Indigogruppe\"] [On the compounds of the indigo group], ''Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin'', '''16''' :   2188-2204 ; see especially p. 2204.</ref>)  The synthesis of indigo remained impractical, so the search for alternative starting materials at [[Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik]] (BASF) and Hoechst continued.

BASF developed a commercially feasible manufacturing process that was in use by 1897, at which time 19,000 tons of indigo were being produced from plant sources. This had dropped to 1,000 tons by 1914 and continued to contract. By 2011 50,000 tons of synthetic indigo were being produced worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemists go green to make better blue jeans|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00103-8|website=Nature|publisher=Nature|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Dyeing technology==\n[[File:Leucoindigo structure.png|thumb|Indigo white (leuco-indigo)]]\n[[File:IndigoDyedYarn.JPG|thumb|Yarn dyed with indigo dye]]\n\n===Indigo white===\nIndigo is a challenging dye because it is not [[soluble]] in water.  To be dissolved, it must undergo a chemical change ([[Redox|reduction]]).  Reduction converts indigo into \"white indigo\" ([[leuco dye|leuco]]-indigo).  When a submerged fabric is removed from the dyebath, the white indigo quickly combines with [[oxygen]] in the air and reverts to the insoluble, intensely colored indigo. When it first became widely available in Europe in the 16th century, European dyers and printers struggled with indigo because of this distinctive property. It also required several chemical manipulations, some involving toxic materials, and had many opportunities to injure workers.  In the 19th century, English poet [[William Wordsworth]] referred to the plight of indigo dye workers of his hometown of Cockermouth in his autobiographical poem ''The Prelude''.  Speaking of their dire working conditions and the empathy that he felt for them, he wrote:\n:Doubtless, I should have then made common cause\n:With some who perished; haply perished too\n:A poor mistaken and bewildered offering\n:Unknown to those bare souls of miller blue\n\nA pre-industrial process for production of indigo white, used in Europe, was to dissolve the indigo in stale urine, which contains ammonia.  A more convenient reductive agent is zinc. Another pre-industrial method, used in Japan, was to dissolve the indigo in a heated vat in which a culture of [[thermophile|thermophilic]], [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] bacteria was maintained. Some species of such bacteria generate [[hydrogen]] as a metabolic product, which  convert insoluble indigo into soluble indigo white. Cloth dyed in such a vat was decorated with the techniques of ''[[shibori]]'' (tie-dye), ''[[kasuri]], [[katazome]]'', and ''[[tsutsugaki]]''. Examples of clothing and banners dyed with these techniques can be seen in the works of [[Hokusai]] and other artists.\n\n===Direct printing===\nTwo different methods for the direct application of indigo were developed in England in the 18th century and remained in use well into the 19th century. The first method, known as 'pencil blue' because it was most often applied by pencil or brush, could be used to achieve dark hues. [[Arsenic trisulfide]] and a thickener were added to the indigo vat. The arsenic compound delayed the oxidation of the indigo long enough to paint the dye onto fabrics.\n\n[[File:IndigoDyePotOnStove.JPG|thumb|Pot of freeze-dried indigo dye]]\nThe second method was known as 'China blue' due to its resemblance to Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Instead of using an indigo solution directly, the process involved printing the insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric. The indigo was then reduced in a sequence of baths of [[iron(II) sulfate]], with air-oxidation between each immersion. The China blue process could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues possible with the pencil blue method.\n\nAround 1880, the 'glucose process' was developed. It finally enabled the direct printing of indigo onto fabric and could produce inexpensive dark indigo prints unattainable with the China blue method.\n\nSince 2004, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] indigo, or instant indigo, has become available. In this method, the indigo has already been reduced, and then freeze-dried into a crystal. The crystals are added to warm water to create the dye pot. As in a standard indigo dye pot, care has to be taken to avoid mixing in oxygen. Freeze-dried indigo is simple to use, and the crystals can be stored indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to moisture.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |title=Directions for Instant Indigo |author=Judith McKenzie McCuin |access-date=2008-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041116195957/http://paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |archive-date=2004-11-16}}</ref>\n\n==Chemical properties==\n[[File:Indigo3D.png|thumb|170px|Indigo, space-filling]]\nIndigo dye is a dark blue crystalline powder that [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] at {{convert|390|\u2013|392|C}}.

Ersahin gained experience by leading both a trio and a quartet at Sweet Basil and began performing in international [[jazz festivals]]. In 2002, Ersahin opened the Club Nublu on Avenue C. Nublu is regarded as the last hold-out of the free-wheeling spirit that the Lower East Side was known for, pre-gentrification. More than simply a club, it has become known round the world as a workshop and breeding-ground for musicians interested in trans-cultural, uncharted and multi-disciplinary music.\n\n==Bands and albums==\nWhile performing his Saturday brunch sets at Sweet Basil, performing modern jazz, Ersahin attracted the attention of a small independent label in San Francisco called [[Golden Horn]] and recorded two albums for them. His first record was called \"Our Song,\" (1997)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/our-song-mw0000751090 All Music]</ref> and featured Eddie Henderson, [[Doug Weiss]], Jon Davis and [[Kenny Wollesen]].

His sound was described by critics as \"[[post-bop]],\" and he was praised for his original compositions.<ref>[http://www.goldenhorn.com/display.php4?content=records&page=ghp005.html Golden Horn Records]</ref>\n\nBut the cosmopolitan, edgy ambiance of late 1990s New York was re-orienting Ersahin's creativity. The year 2000 marked a pivotal shift in his approach to music as he released two albums with a new approach. On \"Virgo,\" he worked with voice and words in a new way, by adding the political hip-hop poet, [[Saul Williams]] to the mix of drummer [[Brian Blade]], pianist Jon Davis, bass player Larry Grenadier and Val Jeanty, a vocalist and electronic sample player.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/virgo-mw0001059896 All Music, Virgo]</ref> In late 1990, the first phase of what would become a long-running project, \"Wax Poetic,\" was also released on a deal with [[Atlantic Records]].

[[Norah Jones]] was the band's lead singer for two years and her first released recorded song was \"[[Norah Jones discography|Angels]],\" on Wax Poetic's first self-titled record. Initially released on Atlantic Records in 2000, it was re-issued on Nublu Records in 2013.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Wax-Poetic/e/B000APGN10/ref=ac_dtp_sa_bio Amazon, Wax Poetic]</ref> Other musicians on that record were [[Arto Tuncboyaciyan]], Marlon Browden, Eddie Henderson, [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]] and Guyora Kats. Its sound is a snapshot of downtown NYC at that time, and the video features the band in iconic Lower East Side locations such as [[Tompkins Square Park]].<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xm99i_wax-poetic-norah-jones-angels_music Daily Motion]</ref>\n\nReleased two years after the opening of the Nublu club, \"Wax Poetic Nublu Sessions,\" 2004, was equally a time capsule of the excitement and spontaneous energy of the club's live shows and legendary jams. This incarnation of Wax Poetic had a strong spread of voices, including Norah Jones, soul-jazz diva, [[N'Dea Davenport]], Saul Williams, Marla Turner, and Turkish singer [[Nil Karaibrahimgil]].<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/review/waxpoetic-nublu/ Pop Matters]</ref>\n\nErsahin delved more specifically into the modal textures of Turkish music in his atmospheric album \"Harikalar Diyari (Wonderland)\" in 2002.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/harikalar-diyari-wonderland-mw0001438779 All Music, Wonderland]</ref> Wonderland also features the sound of [[H\u00fcsn\u00fc \u015eenlendirici]], a third generation Turkish clarinet virtuoso. This record was a particularly important release in Turkey, as it featured four then unknown up and coming artists who went on to become famous: H\u00fcsn\u00fc \u015eenlendirici and vocalists [[Nil Karaibrahimgil]], Bora Uzer and Dilara Sakpinar, who was 14 at the time of the recording. Its blend of traditional 'world music' with electronica and dance beats, was new in Turkey and made the record extremely successful and influential.<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/248 Nublu]</ref>\n\nTo capture the sound of his creative Nublu community, Ersahin founded Nublu Records in 2005. Among their first releases were three releases under the name Wax Poetic; however, in that period, the band was not active and Ersahin adopted the name for his experiments with local musicians in different countries. The result was a conceptual trilogy: \u201cCopenhagen\u201d (2006), \u201cBrasil\u201d (2007) and \u201cIstanbul\u201d(2007.)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/copenhagen-mw0000444637 AllMusic, Copenhagen]</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/brasil-mw0000479302 AllMusic, Brasil]</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/istanbul-mw0000558464 AllMusic, Istanbul]</ref>\n\nThe next Wax Poetic release, \"On A Ride,\" (2012)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/on-a-ride-mw0002409540 All Music, On A Ride]</ref> was an encounter between Ersahin and Swedish pop producer Klas Wikberg.<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/265 Nublu]</ref> In 2013, Wax Poetic released \"Tonight,\" an album of remixes by [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]] and Rob Garza from [[Thievery Corporation]];<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Wax-Poetic/e/B000APGN10/digital/ref=ntt_mp3_rdr?_encoding=UTF8&sn=d Amazon]</ref> and Ersahin started yet another version of Wax Poetic, working with producer Gus Oberg, who produced the last two albums by the band, [[Angles (The Strokes album)|The Strokes]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/654582-Gus-Oberg Discogs, Gus Oberg]</ref>\n\nMany more projects emerged from Nublu Club's creative crucible. Ersahin released two albums as part of the Love Trio, together with Californian bassist [[Jesse Murphy (bassist)|Jesse Murphy]] (who went on to play with [[The Brazilian Girls]],) and drummer Kenny Wollesen who plays with [[Tom Waits]] and [[John Zorn]], among many others. The improvisational trio gave Ersahin the opportunity to explore his roots in [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]], along with [[turntablism]] and the new [[electronica]], which dub had inspired in a generation, mixed with dance music. They released two albums on Nublu Records, \"Love Trio\" (2003) featuring contributions from Ersahin's longtime partner, legendary trumpeter Eddie Henderson, vocalist Marla Turner, Kenny Wollesen, Brazilian Girls bass player Jesse Murphy and DJ Logic; and \"Love Trio in Dub with U-Roy,\" (2006.) The voices of The Brazilian Girls' [[Sabina Sciubba]] and Marla Turner are featured on this album as well.\n\nAlso in 2006, Ersahin played in and produced the Nublu Orchestra album under the direction of Butch Morris, the presiding genius of Nublu.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Nublu-Orchestra-Conducted-Butch-Morris/dp/B000LPR50M Amazon, Nublu Orchestra]</ref> As Morris resided on nearby East 7th Street, Nublu became not just a welcoming but a convenient laboratory for the creator of the Conduction sound. From the club's opening until his death a decade later, Nublu was the creative home base from which Morris was able to spread Conduction globally.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/arts/music/butch-morris-dies-at-65-creator-of-conduction.html NY Times, Obit]</ref>\n\nAdding to a busy 2006, Ersahin also launched another project, Our Theory. Ersahin described the Our Theory sound to All About Jazz magazine as \"Nu-Jazz.\" The group began when Ersahin met French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz on the road. Deciding to record a few sessions together, they formed Our Theory with Matt Penman, a young bass player from New Zealand; at the time Wax Poetic's guitarist and drummer, Thor Madsen and Jochen Rueckert, the latter also an accomplished electronica man. Their experimental, ambient jazz self-titled album on Nublu Records was improvised and recorded in the studio over a period of two days; then Ersahin and Madsen cut and pasted the tapes over the next two years.<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=25672#.Uwkqx15FcQU All About Jazz]</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Thinking About You (Norah Jones song)|Thinking About You]],\" a track Ersahin co-wrote with Norah Jones, came out on her 2007 album, \"[[Not Too Late (album)|Not Too Late]].\" He also wrote the score for a BBC/Swedish TV documentary on Nobel Prize winner, Turkish [[Orhan Pamuk]], in 2008.<ref>[http://www.womex.com/virtual/nublu_records/ilhan_ersahin Womex]</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Ersahin composed the soundtrack for director Fatih Akin's section in the movie \"[[New York, I Love You]],\" a compilation of eleven director's segments on the city. Also in 2009, Ersahin helped form I Led Three Lives, a trio in which he played saxophone and keyboards together with drummer Jochen Rueckert and bass player Juini Booth of Tony Williams and the [[Sun Ra Arkestra]], all regulars at the Nublu club. The trio formed as a result of many late-night jam sessions at Nublu. Their track, \"House of Ahmet,\" from the album, \"Peace Now,\"(2008) was selected as Song of the Day by Washington University's WKEXP who described \"the album's range of sounds \u2013 electronica, techno, jazz, funk, blues, hip hop, house, and even psychedelia \u2013 and its ability to slash through any preconceived genre restrictions and examine how far these established stylistic ranges can be pushed.\"<ref>[http://blog.kexp.org/2008/12/10/song-of-the-day-i-led-3-lives-house-of-ahmet/ KEXP]</ref><ref>[http://www.discogs.com/I-Led-3-Lives-Peace-Now/release/2309258 Discogs, Peace Now]</ref>\n\nErsahin's next two releases both revisited musical terrain he had explored with Wax Poetic. For the first time, Ersahin chose to include himself in the group's name, calling his even more personal tribute to the city he loved, \"Ilhan Ersahin's Istanbul Sessions.\"<ref>[http://www.istanbulsessions.nublu.net/ Istanbul Sessions]</ref> For a 2009 art event being held in that city, Ersahin formed Istanbul Sessions with local players bassist Alp Ersonmez, drummer Turgut Alp Bekoglu, and percussionist Izzet Kizil.<ref>[http://yabangee.com/event/ilhan-ersahins-istanbul-sessions-nublu-istanbul/ Yabangee]</ref> The one-off combo was so well received that they toured Europe and played in America and recorded an album the following year that reunited Ersahin with French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz. Istanbul Session' next release, \"Night Rider,\" (2011) blended a cosmopolitan electro feel with its improvised jazz. Le Monde said, \"Hear this! Jazz has changed form.\"<ref>[http://istanbul2010.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/09/08/le-new-yorkais-ilhan-ersahin-au-festival-jazz-in-ramadan-ramazanda-caz/ Le Monde]</ref> Jazzwise Magazine described Istanbul Sessions as \"...a highly distinctive new sound that connects the dense modal funk of Miles Davis' Agartha group with the dervish whirl of Turkish and middle-eastern melodies and spikes it with a potent shot of dub electronics.\"<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/264 Nublu]</ref> Writer Eli Dvorkin of [http://Flavorwire.com Flavorwire] saw Istanbul Sessions perform in Istanbul and described what he called a quintessential hometown gig: \u201cA sold-out crowd at Babylon, one of Istanbul\u2019s best live-music clubs.

Nublu's jam sessions captured the freewheeling rivalry of cutting sessions at clubs like the legendary [[Minton's Playhouse]]'s in the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s. The club's hipness was underlined by the single blue light outside the door and lack of a name signboard, giving the club the feel of a secret speakeasy adventure. Bands and DJ's performed in the middle of the club, among the audience, giving it the ambiance of an underground event.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/fashion/sundaystyles/05BOITE.html?pagewanted=print NY Times Fashion]</ref> Its authenticity made Nublu a safe zone for artists, has seen many stars drop in over the years like the late [[Lou Reed]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[David Byrne]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Bebel Gilberto]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and many more.<ref>[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/holy-war-nublu-liquor-license-revoked-because-of-jehovahs-witnesses/ NY Times Local]</ref> The club's commitment to integrating turntablism into live action prompted Moby to tell XLR8R magazine in 2008 that he \"had more fun DJing records for 75 people at Nublu than going on tour and performing in front of 10,000 people a night.\"<ref>[http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2008/04/entertain-us-state-electronica XLR8R]</ref> Butch Morris held a residency there from the club's opening until his death in 2013 and led the Nublu Orchestra.\n\n==Nublu records==\nThe intense creativity that revolved around the Nublu club prompted Ersahin to start a Nublu label in 2005 as a platform for his own groups and those of his fellow players who made the club their home from home. Artists on Nublu Records include Ersahin's bands, Love Trio, Our Theory, Istanbul Sessions, I Led Three Lives, Wonderland and Wax Poetic; electronic dance-pop acts Hess Is More, aka Danish musician Michael Hess, praised by WNYC.com for his cinematic sensibility,<ref>[http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/138360-gig-alert-hess-more/ WNYC]</ref> and Kudu, the edgy Brooklyn-based trio; Turkish DJ Baris K; Brazilian band [[:pt:3 na Massa|3 Na Massa]], Brazilian singer Otto and [[Calibro 35]] from Milan, Italy.\n\n==Festivals==\nErsahin has been actively involved in promoting festivals from his earliest days in New York. He directed Istanbul's [[Akbank]] Jazz Festival<ref>[http://www.turkishculture.org/whoiswho/ilhan-ersahin-960.htm Turkish Cultural Foundation]</ref> and the [[Istanbul International Jazz Festival]] jam sessions for four years in a row, starting in 1996. There, he jammed alongside the likes of [[Sam Rivers]], John Zorn, Dave Douglas, [[Roy Hargrove]], Marcus Miller, Nicolas Payton and many more. The Nublu Jazz festival first came to be in 2009 and is now a yearly event in [[New York City]], [[Sao Paulo]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/494 Nublu]</ref> The Sun Ra Arkestra, Robert Glasper, [[Junip]], Erik Truffaz, Roy Ayers, Bugge Wesseltoft, Tulipa Ruiz, Mark Turner, Graham Haynes and Adam Rudolph are among the many who have attended the Festivals so far. Ersahin told the French newspaper ''Liberation'', who hailed him as the King of Manhattan's downtown, \"Istanbul reminds me a lot of New York and Sao Paulo.

Initially released on Atlantic Records in 2000, it was re-issued on Nublu Records in 2013.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Wax-Poetic/e/B000APGN10/ref=ac_dtp_sa_bio Amazon, Wax Poetic]</ref> Other musicians on that record were [[Arto Tuncboyaciyan]], Marlon Browden, Eddie Henderson, [[Kurt Rosenwinkel]] and Guyora Kats. Its sound is a snapshot of downtown NYC at that time, and the video features the band in iconic Lower East Side locations such as [[Tompkins Square Park]].<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xm99i_wax-poetic-norah-jones-angels_music Daily Motion]</ref>\n\nReleased two years after the opening of the Nublu club, \"Wax Poetic Nublu Sessions,\" 2004, was equally a time capsule of the excitement and spontaneous energy of the club's live shows and legendary jams. This incarnation of Wax Poetic had a strong spread of voices, including Norah Jones, soul-jazz diva, [[N'Dea Davenport]], Saul Williams, Marla Turner, and Turkish singer [[Nil Karaibrahimgil]].<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/review/waxpoetic-nublu/ Pop Matters]</ref>\n\nErsahin delved more specifically into the modal textures of Turkish music in his atmospheric album \"Harikalar Diyari (Wonderland)\" in 2002.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/harikalar-diyari-wonderland-mw0001438779 All Music, Wonderland]</ref> Wonderland also features the sound of [[H\u00fcsn\u00fc \u015eenlendirici]], a third generation Turkish clarinet virtuoso. This record was a particularly important release in Turkey, as it featured four then unknown up and coming artists who went on to become famous: H\u00fcsn\u00fc \u015eenlendirici and vocalists [[Nil Karaibrahimgil]], Bora Uzer and Dilara Sakpinar, who was 14 at the time of the recording. Its blend of traditional 'world music' with electronica and dance beats, was new in Turkey and made the record extremely successful and influential.<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/248 Nublu]</ref>\n\nTo capture the sound of his creative Nublu community, Ersahin founded Nublu Records in 2005. Among their first releases were three releases under the name Wax Poetic; however, in that period, the band was not active and Ersahin adopted the name for his experiments with local musicians in different countries. The result was a conceptual trilogy: \u201cCopenhagen\u201d (2006), \u201cBrasil\u201d (2007) and \u201cIstanbul\u201d(2007.)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/copenhagen-mw0000444637 AllMusic, Copenhagen]</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/brasil-mw0000479302 AllMusic, Brasil]</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/istanbul-mw0000558464 AllMusic, Istanbul]</ref>\n\nThe next Wax Poetic release, \"On A Ride,\" (2012)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/on-a-ride-mw0002409540 All Music, On A Ride]</ref> was an encounter between Ersahin and Swedish pop producer Klas Wikberg.<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/265 Nublu]</ref> In 2013, Wax Poetic released \"Tonight,\" an album of remixes by [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]] and Rob Garza from [[Thievery Corporation]];<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Wax-Poetic/e/B000APGN10/digital/ref=ntt_mp3_rdr?_encoding=UTF8&sn=d Amazon]</ref> and Ersahin started yet another version of Wax Poetic, working with producer Gus Oberg, who produced the last two albums by the band, [[Angles (The Strokes album)|The Strokes]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/654582-Gus-Oberg Discogs, Gus Oberg]</ref>\n\nMany more projects emerged from Nublu Club's creative crucible. Ersahin released two albums as part of the Love Trio, together with Californian bassist [[Jesse Murphy (bassist)|Jesse Murphy]] (who went on to play with [[The Brazilian Girls]],) and drummer Kenny Wollesen who plays with [[Tom Waits]] and [[John Zorn]], among many others. The improvisational trio gave Ersahin the opportunity to explore his roots in [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]], along with [[turntablism]] and the new [[electronica]], which dub had inspired in a generation, mixed with dance music. They released two albums on Nublu Records, \"Love Trio\" (2003) featuring contributions from Ersahin's longtime partner, legendary trumpeter Eddie Henderson, vocalist Marla Turner, Kenny Wollesen, Brazilian Girls bass player Jesse Murphy and DJ Logic; and \"Love Trio in Dub with U-Roy,\" (2006.) The voices of The Brazilian Girls' [[Sabina Sciubba]] and Marla Turner are featured on this album as well.\n\nAlso in 2006, Ersahin played in and produced the Nublu Orchestra album under the direction of Butch Morris, the presiding genius of Nublu.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Nublu-Orchestra-Conducted-Butch-Morris/dp/B000LPR50M Amazon, Nublu Orchestra]</ref> As Morris resided on nearby East 7th Street, Nublu became not just a welcoming but a convenient laboratory for the creator of the Conduction sound. From the club's opening until his death a decade later, Nublu was the creative home base from which Morris was able to spread Conduction globally.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/arts/music/butch-morris-dies-at-65-creator-of-conduction.html NY Times, Obit]</ref>\n\nAdding to a busy 2006, Ersahin also launched another project, Our Theory. Ersahin described the Our Theory sound to All About Jazz magazine as \"Nu-Jazz.\" The group began when Ersahin met French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz on the road. Deciding to record a few sessions together, they formed Our Theory with Matt Penman, a young bass player from New Zealand; at the time Wax Poetic's guitarist and drummer, Thor Madsen and Jochen Rueckert, the latter also an accomplished electronica man. Their experimental, ambient jazz self-titled album on Nublu Records was improvised and recorded in the studio over a period of two days; then Ersahin and Madsen cut and pasted the tapes over the next two years.<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=25672#.Uwkqx15FcQU All About Jazz]</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Thinking About You (Norah Jones song)|Thinking About You]],\" a track Ersahin co-wrote with Norah Jones, came out on her 2007 album, \"[[Not Too Late (album)|Not Too Late]].\" He also wrote the score for a BBC/Swedish TV documentary on Nobel Prize winner, Turkish [[Orhan Pamuk]], in 2008.<ref>[http://www.womex.com/virtual/nublu_records/ilhan_ersahin Womex]</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Ersahin composed the soundtrack for director Fatih Akin's section in the movie \"[[New York, I Love You]],\" a compilation of eleven director's segments on the city. Also in 2009, Ersahin helped form I Led Three Lives, a trio in which he played saxophone and keyboards together with drummer Jochen Rueckert and bass player Juini Booth of Tony Williams and the [[Sun Ra Arkestra]], all regulars at the Nublu club. The trio formed as a result of many late-night jam sessions at Nublu. Their track, \"House of Ahmet,\" from the album, \"Peace Now,\"(2008) was selected as Song of the Day by Washington University's WKEXP who described \"the album's range of sounds \u2013 electronica, techno, jazz, funk, blues, hip hop, house, and even psychedelia \u2013 and its ability to slash through any preconceived genre restrictions and examine how far these established stylistic ranges can be pushed.\"<ref>[http://blog.kexp.org/2008/12/10/song-of-the-day-i-led-3-lives-house-of-ahmet/ KEXP]</ref><ref>[http://www.discogs.com/I-Led-3-Lives-Peace-Now/release/2309258 Discogs, Peace Now]</ref>\n\nErsahin's next two releases both revisited musical terrain he had explored with Wax Poetic. For the first time, Ersahin chose to include himself in the group's name, calling his even more personal tribute to the city he loved, \"Ilhan Ersahin's Istanbul Sessions.\"<ref>[http://www.istanbulsessions.nublu.net/ Istanbul Sessions]</ref> For a 2009 art event being held in that city, Ersahin formed Istanbul Sessions with local players bassist Alp Ersonmez, drummer Turgut Alp Bekoglu, and percussionist Izzet Kizil.<ref>[http://yabangee.com/event/ilhan-ersahins-istanbul-sessions-nublu-istanbul/ Yabangee]</ref> The one-off combo was so well received that they toured Europe and played in America and recorded an album the following year that reunited Ersahin with French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz. Istanbul Session' next release, \"Night Rider,\" (2011) blended a cosmopolitan electro feel with its improvised jazz. Le Monde said, \"Hear this! Jazz has changed form.\"<ref>[http://istanbul2010.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/09/08/le-new-yorkais-ilhan-ersahin-au-festival-jazz-in-ramadan-ramazanda-caz/ Le Monde]</ref> Jazzwise Magazine described Istanbul Sessions as \"...a highly distinctive new sound that connects the dense modal funk of Miles Davis' Agartha group with the dervish whirl of Turkish and middle-eastern melodies and spikes it with a potent shot of dub electronics.\"<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/264 Nublu]</ref> Writer Eli Dvorkin of [http://Flavorwire.com Flavorwire] saw Istanbul Sessions perform in Istanbul and described what he called a quintessential hometown gig: \u201cA sold-out crowd at Babylon, one of Istanbul\u2019s best live-music clubs. The rapturous response from the hometown crowd, which eventually spilled out onto the narrow streets and ancient cobblestones of the Beyoglu neighborhood, elevated the show to a plane somewhere above an ordinary Saturday night.\u201d<ref>[http://flavorwire.com/46236/ilhan-ersahins-istanbul-sessions-6-hometown-heroes-greatest-gigs Flavorwire]</ref> Such projects led to Ersahin being described as \"the driving force behind the new Turkish jazz,\" by world music site, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140116103717/http://gladys.opus5.net/en/news/detail/3213/ilhan-ersahin-the-driving-force-behind-new-turkish-jazz.html Gladys Palmera.] Istanbul Sessions performed in Turkey at the 2012 Jazz in Ramadan festival<ref>[http://www.timeoutistanbul.com/en/music/event/26577/Jazz-in-Ramadan-%C4%B0lhan-Er%C5%9Fahin-%C4%B0stanbul-Sessions- Time Out Istanbul]</ref> and at 2013's Babylon Soundgarden Festival.<ref>[http://www.babylonsoundgarden.com/en/news/babylon-soundgarden-2013 Babylon Soundgarden]</ref>\n\nNext in his homages to his urban inspirations came \"Ilhan Ersahin's Afternoons in Rio\" (2011).<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Afternoon-In-Rio-Ilhan-Ersahin/dp/B004VAJIY4 Amazon, Afternoons In Rio]</ref> This time round, he assembled a group of mostly local Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro musicians including Mamelo Sound System's Lurdez da Luz and Rodrigo Brandao, Thalma de Freitas, Junio Barreto, China, Kassin, Fernando Catatau and Nina Becker. The website Sounds and Colors described it as \"a certain style of music that is becoming more and more prevalent in Sao Paulo (i.e. the noirish-take on samba perfected by [[C\u00e9U]]), as well as showing musical links between New York and Sao Paulo and allowing for a number of very talented Brazilian musicians to get their chance to shine outside of their country.\"<ref>[http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/ilhan-ersahin-afternoon-in-rio/ Sounds and Colours]</ref>\n\nErsahin's horn has become identified with a modal style of jazz, combining the influence of the cool Nordic sound to the minor-key strains of Istanbul and the quirky funk of the East Village, Manhattan.<ref>[https://lucidculture.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/cd-review-ilhan-ersahins-istanbul-sessions-with-erik-truffaz/ Lucid Culture]</ref> Continuing his work as a songwriter with Brazilian links, in 2011 Ersahin co-wrote a track called \"Six Minutos,\" with Brazilian vocalist Otto for his album, \"Certa Manha Acordei de Sonhos Intranquilos.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/arts/music/20otto.html?_r=0 NY Times Arts]</ref> In 2012 Ersahin also co-wrote the song \" Like This,\" with top Brazilian singer, [[Tulipa Ruiz]].\nAlthough Ersahin has performed at many of the world's largest concert halls, his affinity for the boho soul of jazz is evident in the videos posted to YouTube of him jamming by the Bosphorus.\n\n==Nublu Club==\nWhen Ilhan Ersahin opened the [[Nublu Club]] in 2002, it captured the budding synergy between hiphop turntablists, the avant-garde jazzers who were still in the Lower East Side, and DJ's and players from Europe, Jamaica, Africa and Brazil. Nublu's jam sessions captured the freewheeling rivalry of cutting sessions at clubs like the legendary [[Minton's Playhouse]]'s in the [[bebop]] era of the 1940s. The club's hipness was underlined by the single blue light outside the door and lack of a name signboard, giving the club the feel of a secret speakeasy adventure. Bands and DJ's performed in the middle of the club, among the audience, giving it the ambiance of an underground event.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/fashion/sundaystyles/05BOITE.html?pagewanted=print NY Times Fashion]</ref> Its authenticity made Nublu a safe zone for artists, has seen many stars drop in over the years like the late [[Lou Reed]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[David Byrne]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Bebel Gilberto]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and many more.<ref>[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/holy-war-nublu-liquor-license-revoked-because-of-jehovahs-witnesses/ NY Times Local]</ref> The club's commitment to integrating turntablism into live action prompted Moby to tell XLR8R magazine in 2008 that he \"had more fun DJing records for 75 people at Nublu than going on tour and performing in front of 10,000 people a night.\"<ref>[http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2008/04/entertain-us-state-electronica XLR8R]</ref> Butch Morris held a residency there from the club's opening until his death in 2013 and led the Nublu Orchestra.\n\n==Nublu records==\nThe intense creativity that revolved around the Nublu club prompted Ersahin to start a Nublu label in 2005 as a platform for his own groups and those of his fellow players who made the club their home from home. Artists on Nublu Records include Ersahin's bands, Love Trio, Our Theory, Istanbul Sessions, I Led Three Lives, Wonderland and Wax Poetic; electronic dance-pop acts Hess Is More, aka Danish musician Michael Hess, praised by WNYC.com for his cinematic sensibility,<ref>[http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/138360-gig-alert-hess-more/ WNYC]</ref> and Kudu, the edgy Brooklyn-based trio; Turkish DJ Baris K; Brazilian band [[:pt:3 na Massa|3 Na Massa]], Brazilian singer Otto and [[Calibro 35]] from Milan, Italy.\n\n==Festivals==\nErsahin has been actively involved in promoting festivals from his earliest days in New York. He directed Istanbul's [[Akbank]] Jazz Festival<ref>[http://www.turkishculture.org/whoiswho/ilhan-ersahin-960.htm Turkish Cultural Foundation]</ref> and the [[Istanbul International Jazz Festival]] jam sessions for four years in a row, starting in 1996. There, he jammed alongside the likes of [[Sam Rivers]], John Zorn, Dave Douglas, [[Roy Hargrove]], Marcus Miller, Nicolas Payton and many more. The Nublu Jazz festival first came to be in 2009 and is now a yearly event in [[New York City]], [[Sao Paulo]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>[http://www.nublu.net/article/494 Nublu]</ref> The Sun Ra Arkestra, Robert Glasper, [[Junip]], Erik Truffaz, Roy Ayers, Bugge Wesseltoft, Tulipa Ruiz, Mark Turner, Graham Haynes and Adam Rudolph are among the many who have attended the Festivals so far. Ersahin told the French newspaper ''Liberation'', who hailed him as the King of Manhattan's downtown, \"Istanbul reminds me a lot of New York and Sao Paulo. Young people go out all the time and there are lots of interesting places to go.\"<ref>[http://next.liberation.fr/musique/2010/03/12/nublu-rois-new-yorkais-de-banlieues-bleues_614733 Liberation]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ersahin, Ilhan}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Swedish composers]]\n[[Category:Swedish male composers]]\n[[Category:Swedish people of Turkish descent]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Kelpo11", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0lhan_Er%C5%9Fahin"}
