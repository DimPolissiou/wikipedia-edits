A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he won the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] as a player. He also scored an equalizing goal to make it 2\u20132 in the 81st minute of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final]] vs [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], but it ended up with a 3-2 victory for Argentina.\n\nAlong with [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Didier Deschamps]], V\u00f6ller has the distinction of reaching a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final as both a player ([[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|1990]]) and as a manager ([[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|2002]]).\n\n==Club career==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nV\u00f6ller started his career with [[TSV Hanau|1860 Hanau]], then played for second division sides [[Kickers Offenbach]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich]], before joining [[Bundesliga]] club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in 1982, winning his first cap for West Germany that same year. Following a successful season in which he was the Bundesliga's top scorer, foreign clubs became interested in the striker, and in 1987 he was transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], where he became a mainstay of the team and earned the nickname \"''er tedesco''\" (\"the German\") and also \"''il tedesco volante''\" (\"the flying German\").<ref>[http://www.asromaultras.org/tedescovola.wav A.S. Roma supporters sing 'tedesco, vola!']</ref> He won the [[Coppa Italia]] in [[1990\u201391 Coppa Italia|1991]] and was the club's top scorer on several occasions.\n\nIn 1992, Roma decided to sell V\u00f6ller to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], where he was intended as replacement for superstar striker [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. That also allowed Roma to add [[Claudio Caniggia]] as its third foreigner to the squad, so both parties were happy to let the deal go through. There he won his biggest club honour in a very successful first season, thanks to the [[UEFA Champions League]] won with Olympique de Marseille against [[AC Milan]] coached by [[Fabio Capello]], in [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]] (1-0, goal scored by [[Basile Boli]]). V\u00f6ller started the match, playing 78 minutes. Marseille was then caught in a bribery scandal, however, and was stripped of its 1993 league title, and were relegated despite a second-place finish in 1994. V\u00f6ller scored 24 league goals for the club but departed after its relegation. Returning to Germany, he joined [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] in 1994, where he ended his career as a player in 1996 and started a career in the management of the club.\n\n==International career==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nV\u00f6ller was capped 90 times for the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]], scoring 47 goals, including eight in World Cup final rounds.\n\nV\u00f6ller also played at three [[UEFA European Championship]]s, starting with [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]], where he scored twice in a group match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] which the Germans won 2\u20131. A 90th minute defeat against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in their next match, however, saw West Germany eliminated when all they needed was a draw.\n\nAt the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], V\u00f6ller scored the West Germans' equalizer in a 2\u20131 win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in the group stage. He bagged a last minute goal against [[France national football team|France]] in the semi-final to seal a 2\u20130 win and in the final itself his 80th-minute goal made it 2\u20132 against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].  Germany had recovered from 2\u20130 down but eventually lost the match 3\u20132. V\u00f6ller became the third player to score as a substitute in the World Cup final, after [[Dick Nanninga]] in 1978 and [[Alessandro Altobelli]] achieved this feat in 1982.\n\nWest Germany hosted the [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], and V\u00f6ller scored twice in a 2\u20130 win over Spain but the hosts lost to eventual winners the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-final.\n\nV\u00f6ller was a member of the team that won the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy. He scored three times in the tournament, including one goal in a 4\u20131 win over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], and then found the net twice against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] in a 5\u20131 win. During the second-round match against the Netherlands, V\u00f6ller and Dutch player [[Frank Rijkaard]] were sent off the field after the Dutchman spit on V\u00f6ller twice.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/22/25-stunning-world-cup-moments-|title= World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No19: Frank Rijkaard and Rudi V\u00f6ller|date=22 May 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\nV\u00f6ller came back to play and start for Germany in both the semi-final against England and the final against Argentina, which Germany won 1\u20130 to claim their 3rd World Cup title.\n\nThe unsavoury incident that took place during the second-round match with the Netherlands started when Rijkaard was booked for a bad tackle on V\u00f6ller. As Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in V\u00f6ller's hair. V\u00f6ller complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, a furious V\u00f6ller then jumped up and punched the ball with his hand (although it looked like he had used his head) and then dived to avoid a collision with Dutch goalkeeper [[Hans van Breukelen]], although it did also look as if he dived for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this, but Rijkaard again confronted V\u00f6ller by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. The temperamental and tough Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau finally had enough of V\u00f6ller and Rijkaard's antics and he sent both players off. Rijkaard then again spat in V\u00f6ller's hair as they left the pitch and was rumoured to have repeated this on the touchline. Rijkaard later stated that it was his fault: \"That day I was wrong. There was no insult. I always had much respect for Rudi V\u00f6ller. But I went berserk when I saw that red card. I talked to him after the match and I apologized. I'm very happy that he accepted. I have no bad feeling about him now. We even posed for a very funny advert together, years after.\" (Rijkaard had family problems in this time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of-enmity.html |title=Cheeseheads vs Krauts\": 30 Years of Enmity<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher=ajax-usa.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116035919/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of-enmity.html |archivedate=16 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nV\u00f6ller was again selected for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] but was sent home when he suffered an injury in the opening game with [[CIS national football team|CIS]].\n\nAt the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], V\u00f6ller was kept out of the starting line up for all three group games by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] and [[Karl-Heinz Riedle]] who scored five between them. He made just one sub appearance in the group stages. He did start the second round tie with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and scored twice in a 3\u20132 win.\n\n==Managing career==\nAfter a disappointing [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] for Germany under manager [[Erich Ribbeck]], the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) appointed V\u00f6ller as new manager, accepting his lack of coaching qualifications at the time.<ref name=\"Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach\">{{cite news|title=Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach|url=http://www.kicker.de/230864/artikel_rudi-voeller-ab-sofort-interims-coach.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=2 July 2000|language=German}}</ref> Initially he only planned to take interimistic responsibility for one year,<ref name=\"Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach\"/> following the decision by [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] and V\u00f6ller himself (as Sporting Director of the Club) not to make [[Christoph Daum]] step down from the national team before 2001.

V\u00f6ller served in that role until [[Michael Skibbe]] was named as the club's new permanent coach that October. After the arrival of Skibbe, V\u00f6ller was promoted to become for the second time sports director at Leverkusen.\n\nV\u00f6ller was (and still is) very popular in Germany. Even when the national squad achieved only modest results, V\u00f6ller never lost his popularity as the German public knew he was achieving as much as possible with a relatively limited squad. His predecessor [[Berti Vogts]], by contrast, was widely \"slagged off\" by everybody even during periods of success with a far more talented German squad. The public even forgave V\u00f6ller when \u2013 during a TV interview after a 0\u20130 draw against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in September 2003 \u2013 he lost his temper and yelled at the presenter Waldemar Hartmann in order to defend his team against, what he thought was, unfair press statements.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:Rudi V\u00f6ller junie 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Rudi V\u00f6ller (2009)]]\n[[File:Rudi voeller stadtbuch.jpg|thumb|right|Rudi V\u00f6ller signs the book of his hometown Hanau.]]\n\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 | Club\n! rowspan=2 | Season\n! colspan=3 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | Europe\n! colspan=2 | Other{{efn|Includes [[1988-89 Serie A#UEFA Cup qualification|1988-89 Serie A UEFA Cup qualification]], [[1991 Supercoppa Italiana]], [[1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]}}\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he won the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] as a player. He also scored an equalizing goal to make it 2\u20132 in the 81st minute of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final]] vs [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], but it ended up with a 3-2 victory for Argentina.\n\nAlong with [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Didier Deschamps]], V\u00f6ller has the distinction of reaching a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final as both a player ([[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|1990]]) and as a manager ([[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|2002]]).\n\n==Club career==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nV\u00f6ller started his career with [[TSV Hanau|1860 Hanau]], then played for second division sides [[Kickers Offenbach]] and [[TSV 1860 Munich]], before joining [[Bundesliga]] club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in 1982, winning his first cap for West Germany that same year. Following a successful season in which he was the Bundesliga's top scorer, foreign clubs became interested in the striker, and in 1987 he was transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], where he became a mainstay of the team and earned the nickname \"''er tedesco''\" (\"the German\") and also \"''il tedesco volante''\" (\"the flying German\").<ref>[http://www.asromaultras.org/tedescovola.wav A.S. Roma supporters sing 'tedesco, vola!']</ref> He won the [[Coppa Italia]] in [[1990\u201391 Coppa Italia|1991]] and was the club's top scorer on several occasions.\n\nIn 1992, Roma decided to sell V\u00f6ller to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], where he was intended as replacement for superstar striker [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. That also allowed Roma to add [[Claudio Caniggia]] as its third foreigner to the squad, so both parties were happy to let the deal go through. There he won his biggest club honour in a very successful first season, thanks to the [[UEFA Champions League]] won with Olympique de Marseille against [[AC Milan]] coached by [[Fabio Capello]], in [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]] (1-0, goal scored by [[Basile Boli]]). V\u00f6ller started the match, playing 78 minutes. Marseille was then caught in a bribery scandal, however, and was stripped of its 1993 league title, and were relegated despite a second-place finish in 1994. V\u00f6ller scored 24 league goals for the club but departed after its relegation. Returning to Germany, he joined [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] in 1994, where he ended his career as a player in 1996 and started a career in the management of the club.\n\n==International career==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nV\u00f6ller was capped 90 times for the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]], scoring 47 goals, including eight in World Cup final rounds.\n\nV\u00f6ller also played at three [[UEFA European Championship]]s, starting with [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]], where he scored twice in a group match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] which the Germans won 2\u20131. A 90th minute defeat against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in their next match, however, saw West Germany eliminated when all they needed was a draw.\n\nAt the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], V\u00f6ller scored the West Germans' equalizer in a 2\u20131 win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in the group stage. He bagged a last minute goal against [[France national football team|France]] in the semi-final to seal a 2\u20130 win and in the final itself his 80th-minute goal made it 2\u20132 against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].  Germany had recovered from 2\u20130 down but eventually lost the match 3\u20132. V\u00f6ller became the third player to score as a substitute in the World Cup final, after [[Dick Nanninga]] in 1978 and [[Alessandro Altobelli]] achieved this feat in 1982.\n\nWest Germany hosted the [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], and V\u00f6ller scored twice in a 2\u20130 win over Spain but the hosts lost to eventual winners the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-final.\n\nV\u00f6ller was a member of the team that won the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy. He scored three times in the tournament, including one goal in a 4\u20131 win over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], and then found the net twice against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] in a 5\u20131 win. During the second-round match against the Netherlands, V\u00f6ller and Dutch player [[Frank Rijkaard]] were sent off the field after the Dutchman spit on V\u00f6ller twice.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/22/25-stunning-world-cup-moments-|title= World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No19: Frank Rijkaard and Rudi V\u00f6ller|date=22 May 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\nV\u00f6ller came back to play and start for Germany in both the semi-final against England and the final against Argentina, which Germany won 1\u20130 to claim their 3rd World Cup title.\n\nThe unsavoury incident that took place during the second-round match with the Netherlands started when Rijkaard was booked for a bad tackle on V\u00f6ller. As Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in V\u00f6ller's hair. V\u00f6ller complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, a furious V\u00f6ller then jumped up and punched the ball with his hand (although it looked like he had used his head) and then dived to avoid a collision with Dutch goalkeeper [[Hans van Breukelen]], although it did also look as if he dived for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this, but Rijkaard again confronted V\u00f6ller by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. The temperamental and tough Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau finally had enough of V\u00f6ller and Rijkaard's antics and he sent both players off. Rijkaard then again spat in V\u00f6ller's hair as they left the pitch and was rumoured to have repeated this on the touchline. Rijkaard later stated that it was his fault: \"That day I was wrong. There was no insult. I always had much respect for Rudi V\u00f6ller. But I went berserk when I saw that red card. I talked to him after the match and I apologized. I'm very happy that he accepted. I have no bad feeling about him now. We even posed for a very funny advert together, years after.\" (Rijkaard had family problems in this time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of-enmity.html |title=Cheeseheads vs Krauts\": 30 Years of Enmity<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher=ajax-usa.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116035919/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of-enmity.html |archivedate=16 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nV\u00f6ller was again selected for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] but was sent home when he suffered an injury in the opening game with [[CIS national football team|CIS]].\n\nAt the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], V\u00f6ller was kept out of the starting line up for all three group games by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] and [[Karl-Heinz Riedle]] who scored five between them. He made just one sub appearance in the group stages. He did start the second round tie with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and scored twice in a 3\u20132 win.\n\n==Managing career==\nAfter a disappointing [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] for Germany under manager [[Erich Ribbeck]], the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) appointed V\u00f6ller as new manager, accepting his lack of coaching qualifications at the time.<ref name=\"Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach\">{{cite news|title=Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach|url=http://www.kicker.de/230864/artikel_rudi-voeller-ab-sofort-interims-coach.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=2 July 2000|language=German}}</ref> Initially he only planned to take interimistic responsibility for one year,<ref name=\"Rudi V\u00f6ller ab sofort Interims-Coach\"/> following the decision by [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] and V\u00f6ller himself (as Sporting Director of the Club) not to make [[Christoph Daum]] step down from the national team before 2001. However, V\u00f6ller extended his contract due to good results, after Daum became involved in a controversial drug scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1114006.stm|title=Daum: I took cocaine|date=2001-01-12|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite losing to [[England national football team|England]] [[2001 Germany vs England football match|5\u20131]] at home and two disappointing draws against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] during qualification he managed to lead the team to a surprising appearance in the final of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] against Brazil.\n\nAfter a first-round exit from [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], he resigned from his post.<ref name=\"Rudi V\u00f6ller nimmt seinen Hut\">{{cite news|title=Rudi V\u00f6ller nimmt seinen Hut|url=http://www.kicker.de/300729/artikel_rudi-voeller-nimmt-seinen-hut.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=24 June 2004|language=German}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his resignation from the German national job, V\u00f6ller briefly made a comeback at Roma in 2004 as manager. Hired in late August as a last-minute appointment after the shock resignation of [[Cesare Prandelli]],<ref name=\"V\u00f6ller wird Teamchef der Roma\">{{cite news|title=V\u00f6ller wird Teamchef der Roma|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/chleague/startseite/303930/artikel_voeller-wird-teamchef-der-roma.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=31 August 2004|language=German}}</ref> he left the club only one month later after a series of poor results and high-profile disagreements with players, notably [[Antonio Cassano]].<ref name=\"Wie das gewertet wird, das ist mir herzlich egal\">{{cite news|title=Wie das gewertet wird, das ist mir herzlich egal|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/intligen/startseite/305041/artikel_wie-das-gewertet-wird-das-ist-mir-herzlich-egal.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=27 September 2004|language=German}}</ref> He only signed a one-year contract to allow a return of Prandelli the next year, but presided over only one draw and two defeats in the league.\n\nMoving back to the support ranks at Bayer Leverkusen, V\u00f6ller was named [[caretaker manager]] of Leverkusen on 16 September 2005 after the club sacked coach [[Klaus Augenthaler]]. V\u00f6ller served in that role until [[Michael Skibbe]] was named as the club's new permanent coach that October. After the arrival of Skibbe, V\u00f6ller was promoted to become for the second time sports director at Leverkusen.\n\nV\u00f6ller was (and still is) very popular in Germany. Even when the national squad achieved only modest results, V\u00f6ller never lost his popularity as the German public knew he was achieving as much as possible with a relatively limited squad. His predecessor [[Berti Vogts]], by contrast, was widely \"slagged off\" by everybody even during periods of success with a far more talented German squad. The public even forgave V\u00f6ller when \u2013 during a TV interview after a 0\u20130 draw against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in September 2003 \u2013 he lost his temper and yelled at the presenter Waldemar Hartmann in order to defend his team against, what he thought was, unfair press statements.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:Rudi V\u00f6ller junie 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Rudi V\u00f6ller (2009)]]\n[[File:Rudi voeller stadtbuch.jpg|thumb|right|Rudi V\u00f6ller signs the book of his hometown Hanau.]]\n\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 | Club\n! rowspan=2 | Season\n! colspan=3 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | Europe\n! colspan=2 | Other{{efn|Includes [[1988-89 Serie A#UEFA Cup qualification|1988-89 Serie A UEFA Cup qualification]], [[1991 Supercoppa Italiana]], [[1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]}}\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

Nevertheless, the short-lived relationship had consequences that went beyond Le Corbusier's time in the USSR. Before his trip to Moscow, Le Corbusier was already an influential figure within the Soviet field of architecture. In 1922, [[Moisei Ginzburg]], founder of the [[Constructivist movement]], published materials from Le Corbusier's \u201c[[Towards a New Architecture]],\u201d and in 1924 published his own book, similar to Le Corbusier's, titled ''Style and Epoch'', which became to a central text to the Constructivist movement. Likewise, Corbusier's projects were frequently published and analyzed as examples for the young generation of Soviet architects to use as inspiration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Frederick|title=Le Corbusier and the USSR: New Documentation|journal=Cahiers du Monde Russe|year=1980|volume=21|issue=21-2|pages=209\u2013221|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/cmr_0008-0160_1980_num_21_2_1388|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> When Le Corbusier died in 1965, the official newspaper of the Soviet Union, [[Pravda]], stated in its obituary, \u201cModern architecture has lost its greatest master.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Moberg|first=Mark|title=Engaging an Anthropological Theory: A Social and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-80916-0|page=295}}</ref>  This statement suggests the importance of Le Corbusier's architecture and urbanism in the Soviet Union.\n\n==1928 trip==\n[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumbnail|[[Tsentrosoyuz building]]]]\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier was invited to participate in a closed competition, which included [[Peter Behrens]], [[Max Taut]], and the [[Vesnin brothers]], for the new headquarters of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives in Moscow. Having been recently humiliated and enraged by the rejection of his proposal for the [[Palace of Nations, Geneva|Headquarters for the League of Nations]] in Geneva, he welcomed the invitation eagerly. After winning the competition, Le Corbusier in October 1928 traveled to the Soviet Union for the first time in order to inspect the site for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building]], that he had been commissioned to build. Before setting off to Moscow, Le Corbusier had already built a considerable interest in the \u201cNew Russia.\u201d Back in Paris, for example, Le Corbusier frequented the \u201cAmis de Spartacus\u201d film club, which projected banned Soviet avant-garde films, like [[Sergei Eisenstein]]\u2019s [[Battleship Potemkin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Jean-Louis|title=Le Corbusier and the Mystique of the USSR: Theories and Projects for Moscow 1928\u20131936|year=1992|publisher=Books on Demand|isbn=0608025836|page=40}}</ref>   On his way to Moscow, Le Corbusier had set his objective in building a movement around his ideas, familiarizing himself with Soviet architectural production, and to test the atmosphere of Moscow, all of which he was able to achieve.

My lectures are held before a packed assembly.\"<ref>Cohen, 42</ref>  Having met his first objective, he set to familiarize himself with the Russian atmosphere and architecture.\n\nWhile in the USSR, Le Corbusier had a young Moscow architecture student named Sergei Kozhin, a former assistant to [[Ivan Zholtovsky]], as his official guide. Besides assisting the Swiss architect with the work for the commission of the Tsentrosoyuz, Kozhin would also introduce Le Corbusier to Russian society. Kozhin took Le Corbusier to the Russian countryside, to a village sixty-five kilometers from Moscow, where Le Corbusier had a first hand account of the conditions of the peripheries of Soviet society as well as traditional Russian wooden architecture. This face-to-face contact would later allow him to write off Soviet society as incapable and unprepared to appreciate modern architecture  when his design for the Palace of the Soviets was rejected in 1932.<ref>Starr, 211</ref>\n\n==The Atmosphere of Moscow==\nLe Corbusier left Moscow in 1928 with a positive view of the Soviet Union. Indeed, his time there would prove influential in the development of his own theories on architecture and urban planning. In 1930, in his ''Precisions on the Present: State of Architecture and City Planning'', Le Corbusier included a report on his observations of Moscow, written en route back to Paris from Moscow. In this report, Le Corbusier reflects on the ''[[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]'' and the \u201cgreen city\u201d plan that the Constructivist architects had developed.\n\nThe [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] required the development of many industrializing projects. Reflecting on the five-year plan, Le Corbusier stated that it presented a battery firing modern technology. Moscow, as he saw it, was a factor for making plans. In his eyes, the development of plans for new buildings in the Soviet Union were being done through whatever means that brought progress. Reflecting on the difference between the profession of architecture in Paris and Moscow, Le Corbusier highlights the superfluous involvement of the youth in the Soviet Union, while in France and other parts of Europe, omnipotent academicism prohibited the youthful from the competitiveness of invention.\n\nWith such youthful, inventive spirit, as Le Corbusier analyzes, the constructivist developed innovative planning schemes.  The \u201cgreen town,\u201d as he analyzes in \u201cAtmosphere of Moscow,\u201d was born out of the necessity of a rest period, introduced by the USSR as a response to the constant labor. The rest period would come on the fifth day of the week, in this way suppressing Sunday's traditional role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Le Corbusier|title=Atmosphere of Moscow|url=http://rosswolfe.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/le-corbusier-vs-ginzburg-on-deurbanization/|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>   The green town was then created to provide the space in which such rest would be carried out. Capable of housing 100,000 people at once, the green town would in 15 days provide rest for the entire population of Moscow, (1.5 million), in accordance with the rotation of the rest period every 5 days. Additionally, the town would also house for periods of two weeks to a month city officials or workers taking their annual vacation. The city would also be a space for the ill \u201cfrom work\u201d to find sanatoria. Beyond this, Le Corbusier also elaborates on the collaborative living that such a city requires: a collective farm would provide food for the entire city; people would live in hostel-type program with common rooms; people would be separated by age, providing different recreational programs for each group. These observations would later serve as the basis for his \u201cResponse to Moscow,\u201d as well as his elaboration of the Radiant City.\n\n==Response to Moscow==\nIn 1931, Soviet officials inquired Le Corbusier's opinion on the reconstruction of the city of Moscow. While in Moscow in 1928, he had taken some quick, hidden (it was prohibited to draw in the streets for fear of espionage) sketches on the city and noted that its plan was \u201cthat of the age of the horse.\u201d<ref>{Cohen, 127</ref>  At the packed conference held at the Polytechnic Museum, he had discussed the significance of city planning and the city's future, yet at the time Le Corbusier had not been interested in Moscow itself.  After his trip, the Soviet Union seemed a central preoccupation. Le Corbusier responded with a 59-page report, \u201cResponse to Moscow,\u201d in which he sketched his ideas for the city. Unfortunately, his initial response is not yet available, hidden in private Russian collections. Nevertheless, his response to such inquiry produced the theoretical basis for [[Ville Radieuse]], the Radiant City. That such an important concept for urbanism derived from Le Corbusier's answer to the Soviet questionnaire suggests the important imprint of the Soviet Union in his career.\n\nIn his response, Le Corbusier developed a plan similar to that proposed by the constructivists for the Green Town. The collectivist spirit that the constructivist had envisioned for their own instantly seduced Le Corbusier, and he in turn implemented these to his own ideas of planning. Much like the Green Town of the Constructivists, in this radiant city for Moscow Le Corbusier utilized services communes, or communal facilities. In it, he also proposed the radical destruction of much of the historic center of Moscow, and advocated the creation of separate cities with separate functions, an idea he had already presented in Moscow during his 1928 trip there. Envisioning the new city with a ruthlessness that [[Haussmann]] would have envied, Le Corbusier placed upon the radial plan of the ancient city a roughly rectilinear organization comparable to his earlier tabula-rasa program of Villa Contemporaine.\n\nHis \u201cResponse to Moscow\u201d was not fit for Soviet society, the authorities that reviewed the response believed. In the end, such a plan for Moscow was never carried out.  Despite this, Le Corbusier did not abandon the project all together but rather used his documents on the project for his own personal ends. He later presented a modified version of his study to the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]], removing all references to the Soviet city, labeling it \u201cVilla Radieuse.\u201d\n\n==Le Corbusier\u2019s Palace of the Soviet==\nLe Corbusier submitted designs for the competition for the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in 1931, which he lost and in effect would end his relationship with the Soviet Union.  After he submitted his design for the first entry, Le Corbusier was informed that his submission had caused considerable stir. No winner was announced for this first round, but he was notified that as a formidable contestant in first entry his project would go on to the second round of the competition. With this, Le Corbusier had reasonable grounds to believe that his project would be among the finalists, if not the winner. But on February 28, 1932, when [[Boris Iofan]]\u2019s neo-classical entry was announced as the winner of the second public competition by the Soviet judges, Le Corbusier was unprepared. Le Corbusier was outraged by the decision, and wrote letters illustrating such feelings, in effect only showing to the Soviet judges his great egotism. But, with the winner announced, it was evident that Le Corbusier\u2019s modernist style was losing ground in the Soviet Union. Even national newspaper, which only a few years earlier heralded his first visit to the city of Moscow, now mocked his design entry as a \u201ccongress hangar.\u201d<ref>Neumeyer</ref>   The high modernism that young Soviet architects aspired to only a few years earlier was being replaced by a [[socialist realism]] best illustrated by neo-classical architecture. Le Corbusier's failure in this project, which in the eyes of the world marked a spectacular reversal in soviet architectural style, would prove to be his final dream and ultimate humiliation in his Moscow adventure.<ref>Cohen, 166</ref>  In the end, Le Corbusier's relationship with Russia would end in disappointment. haram\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Cohen, Jean-Louis (1992).

The reason for this is that for each two integer cores, there is a floating-point unit consisting of a pair of 128-bit [[FMAC]] [[execution unit]]s.\n\nCMT is a simpler but similar design philosophy to [[simultaneous multithreading|SMT]]; both designs try to utilize execution units efficiently; in either method, when two threads compete for some execution pipelines, there is a loss in performance in one or more of the threads. Due to dedicated integer cores, the Bulldozer family modules performed roughly like a dual core dual thread processor during sections of code that were either wholly integer or a mix of integer and floating point; yet, due to the SMT use of the shared floating point pipelines, the module would perform similarly to a single core dual thread SMT processor (SMT2) for a pair of threads saturated with floating point instructions. (Both of these last two comparisons make the assumption that the comparison processor possesses an equally wide and capable execution core, integer-wise and floating-point wise, respectively.)\n\nBoth CMT and SMT are at peak effectiveness while running integer and floating point code on a pair of threads. CMT stays at peak effectiveness while working on a pair of threads consisting both of integer code, while under SMT, one or both threads will underperform due to competition for integer execution units. The disadvantage for CMT is a greater number of idle integer execution units in a single threaded case. In the single threaded case, CMT is limited to use at most half of the integer execution units in its module, while SMT imposes no such limit. A large SMT core with integer circuitry as wide and fast as two CMT cores could in theory have momentarily up to twice an integer performance in a single thread case. (More realistically for general code as a whole, [[Pollack's Rule]] estimates a speedup factor of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, or approximately 40% increase in performance.)\n\nCMT processors and a typical SMT processor are similar in their efficient shared use of the L2 cache between a pair of threads.\n\n* A module consists of a coupling of two \"conventional\" x86 out of order processing cores. The processing core shares the early pipeline stages (e.g. [[CPU cache|L1i]], fetch, decode), the FPUs, and the L2 cache with the rest of the module.\n** Each module has the following independent hardware resources:<ref>{{citation | url=http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/amd/hotchips2010/bulldozeruarch.jpg | title=Bulldozer microarchitecture block | date=August 24, 2010 | publisher=[[AnandTech]]}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/images/news/2010-08/bulldozer_3_aug2010.png | title=Bulldozer module functional schematic | date=August 24, 2010 | publisher=[[AMD]]}}</ref>\n** 16&nbsp;KB 4-way of L1d (way-predicted) per core and 2-way 64&nbsp;KB of L1i per module, one way for each of the two cores<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/bulldozer-bobcat-hot-chips,2724-2.html |title=More On Bulldozer |publisher=Tomshardware.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=AMD Reveals Details About Bulldozer Microprocessors |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20100824154814_AMD_Unveils_Details_About_Bulldozer_Microprocessors.html |title=AMD Reveals Details About Bulldozer Microprocessors |publisher=Xbitlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Real World Technologies |url=http://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT082610181333&p=4 |title=AMD's Bulldozer Microarchitecture |publisher=Realworldtech.com |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>\n** 2&nbsp;MB of L2 cache per module (shared between the two integer cores)\n**Write Coalescing Cache<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldtech.com/bulldozer/9/|title=AMD\u2019s Bulldozer Microarchitecture Memory Subsystem Continued|date=August 26, 2010|author=David Kanter|website=Real World Technologies}}</ref> is a special cache that is part of L2 cache in Bulldozer microarchitecture.

It was not until the refinements made in Piledriver and Steamroller, that the IPC of the Bulldozer family distinctly began to exceed that of K10 processors such as Phenom II.\n\n===[[Branch predictor]]===\n*Two-level Branch Target Buffer(BTB)<ref>https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TitanWorkshop2012_Day1_AMD.pdf</ref>\n*Hybrid predictor for conditionals\n*Indirect predictor\n\n=== Instruction set extensions ===\n* Support for Intel's Advanced Vector Extensions ([[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]]) instruction set, which supports 256-Bit floating point operations, and [[SSE4.1]], [[SSE4.2]], [[AES instruction set|AES]], [[CLMUL instruction set|CLMUL]], as well as future 128-bit instruction sets proposed by AMD ([[XOP instruction set|XOP]], [[FMA4 instruction set#FMA4 instruction set|FMA4]], and [[F16C]]),<ref>{{citation|url=http://techreport.com/discussions.x/16871 |title=XOP and FMA4 Instruction set in SSE5 |publisher=Techreport.com |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref> which have the same functionality as the [[SSE5]] instruction set formerly proposed by AMD, but with compatibility to the [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]] coding scheme.\n*Bulldozer GEN4 ([[Excavator (microarchitecture)|Excavator]]) supports [[AVX2]] instruction sets.\n\n=== Process technology and clock frequency ===\n* 11-metal layer 32&nbsp;nm SOI process with implemented first generation [[GlobalFoundries]]'s [[High-K Metal Gate]] (HKMG)\n* ''Turbo Core 2'' performance boost to increase clock frequency up to 500&nbsp;MHz with all threads active (for most workloads) and up to 1&nbsp;GHz with the half of the thread active, within the TDP limit.<ref>{{citation|url=http://ir.amd.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=74093&p=irol-2010analystday |title=AMD Financial Analyst Day 2010, Server Platforms Presentation |publisher=Ir.amd.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>\n* The chip operates at 0.775 to 1.425&nbsp;V, achieving clock frequencies of 3.6&nbsp;GHz or more<ref name=\"ISSCC 2011\" />\n* Min-Max TDP: 25 \u2013 140&nbsp;watts\n\n=== Cache and memory interface ===\n* Up to 8&nbsp;MB of L3 shared among all cores on the same silicon die (8&nbsp;MB for 4 cores in Desktop segment and 16&nbsp;MB for 8 cores in the Server segment), divided into four subcaches of 2&nbsp;MB each, capable of operating at 2.2&nbsp;GHz at 1.1125&nbsp;V<ref name=\"ISSCC 2011\">{{citation |url=http://isscc.org/doc/2011/isscc2011.advanceprogrambooklet_abstracts.pdf |title=AP |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>\n* Native [[Ddr3|DDR3]] memory support up to DDR3-1866<ref name=\"AMD Roadmap\">{{citation|url=http://news.ati-forum.de/images/stories/Szymanski/News/2010/zambezi_roadmap.jpg |title=AMD Roadmap |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>\n* Dual Channel DDR3 integrated memory controller for Desktop and Server/Workstation Opteron 42xx \"Valencia\";<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.amd.com/us/Documents/Opteron_4000_QRG.pdf |title=AMD Opteron 4200 Series Processor Quick Reference Guide |author=AMD |publisher=www.amd.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> Quad Channel DDR3 Integrated Memory Controller<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.amd.com/us/Documents/Opteron_6000_QRG.pdf |title=AMD Opteron&TM; 6200 Series Processor Quick Reference Guide |author=AMD |publisher=www.amd.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> for Server/Workstation Opteron 62xx \"Interlagos\"\n* AMD claims support for two DIMMs of DDR3-1600 per channel.

The reason for this is that for each two integer cores, there is a floating-point unit consisting of a pair of 128-bit [[FMAC]] [[execution unit]]s.\n\nCMT is a simpler but similar design philosophy to [[simultaneous multithreading|SMT]]; both designs try to utilize execution units efficiently; in either method, when two threads compete for some execution pipelines, there is a loss in performance in one or more of the threads. Due to dedicated integer cores, the Bulldozer family modules performed roughly like a dual core dual thread processor during sections of code that were either wholly integer or a mix of integer and floating point; yet, due to the SMT use of the shared floating point pipelines, the module would perform similarly to a single core dual thread SMT processor (SMT2) for a pair of threads saturated with floating point instructions. (Both of these last two comparisons make the assumption that the comparison processor possesses an equally wide and capable execution core, integer-wise and floating-point wise, respectively.)\n\nBoth CMT and SMT are at peak effectiveness while running integer and floating point code on a pair of threads. CMT stays at peak effectiveness while working on a pair threads consisting both of integer code, while under SMT, one or both threads will underperform due to competition for integer execution units. The disadvantage for CMT is a greater number of idle integer execution units in a single threaded case. In the single threaded case, CMT is limited to use at most half of the integer execution units in its module, while SMT imposes no such limit. A large SMT core with integer circuitry as wide and fast as two CMT cores could in theory have momentarily up to twice an integer performance in a single thread case. (More realistically for general code as a whole, [[Pollack's Rule]] estimates a speedup factor of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, or approximately 40% increase in performance.)\n\nCMT processors and a typical SMT processor are similar in their efficient shared use of the L2 cache between a pair of threads.\n\n* A module consists of a coupling of two \"conventional\" x86 out of order processing cores. The processing core shares the early pipeline stages (e.g. [[CPU cache|L1i]], fetch, decode), the FPUs, and the L2 cache with the rest of the module.\n** Each module has the following independent hardware resources:<ref>{{citation | url=http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/amd/hotchips2010/bulldozeruarch.jpg | title=Bulldozer microarchitecture block | date=August 24, 2010 | publisher=[[AnandTech]]}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/images/news/2010-08/bulldozer_3_aug2010.png | title=Bulldozer module functional schematic | date=August 24, 2010 | publisher=[[AMD]]}}</ref>\n** 16&nbsp;KB 4-way of L1d (way-predicted) per core and 2-way 64&nbsp;KB of L1i per module, one way for each of the two cores<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/bulldozer-bobcat-hot-chips,2724-2.html |title=More On Bulldozer |publisher=Tomshardware.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=AMD Reveals Details About Bulldozer Microprocessors |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20100824154814_AMD_Unveils_Details_About_Bulldozer_Microprocessors.html |title=AMD Reveals Details About Bulldozer Microprocessors |publisher=Xbitlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Real World Technologies |url=http://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT082610181333&p=4 |title=AMD's Bulldozer Microarchitecture |publisher=Realworldtech.com |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>\n** 2&nbsp;MB of L2 cache per module (shared between the two integer cores)\n**Write Coalescing Cache<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldtech.com/bulldozer/9/|title=AMD\u2019s Bulldozer Microarchitecture Memory Subsystem Continued|date=August 26, 2010|author=David Kanter|website=Real World Technologies}}</ref> is a special cache that is part of L2 cache in Bulldozer microarchitecture.

In highly threaded benchmarks, the FX-8150 performed on par with the Phenom II X6, and the [[Intel Core#Core i7 2|Intel Core i7 2600K]], depending on the benchmark. Given the overall more consistent performance of the [[Intel Core#Core i5 2|Intel Core i5 2500K]] at a lower price, these results left many reviewers underwhelmed.
