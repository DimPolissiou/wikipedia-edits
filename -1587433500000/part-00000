It was created by Laura Gibson and developed by Charlie Bennett. The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and [https://maniabets.com/sharron-townsend/ Sharron Townsend] were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth. At the allocation ceremony, the remaining contestants all split the prize money since they all experienced personal growth in their dating life.\n\nSeveral publications have compared the format of ''Too Hot to Handle'' to that of ''[[Love Island (franchise)|Love Island]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curto |first1=Justin |title=Netflix\u2019s Too Hot to Handle Will Fill the Love Is Blind\u2013Size Hole in Your Life |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-trailer-netflix.html |website=vulture.com |publisher=Vulture |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Baty |first1=Emma |title=Netflix Just Made Their Own Version of 'Love Island,' but the Contestants Can\u2019t Hook Up With Each Other |url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a32109096/netflix-too-hot-to-handle-trailer/ |website=cosmopolitan.com |publisher=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast was revealed on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' on 10 April 2020.<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Desiree |title='Too Hot to Handle': Meet the Cast of Your Next Netflix Quarantine Obsession |url=https://www.etonline.com/too-hot-to-handle-meet-the-cast-of-your-next-netflix-quarantine-obsession-144404 |website=etonline.com |publisher=Entertainment Tonight |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.
