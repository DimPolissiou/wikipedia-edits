It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions in the titles' history.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center.

Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) had a rematch with Austin Theory and Angel Garza (with Zelina Vega) where they again retained, though by disqualification.

He was drafted second overall by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[2010 NBA draft]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://realcollegebasketball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=207:2010-nba-mock-draft-first-edition&catid=50:2010 |title=RealCollegeBasketball.com's 2010 NBA Mock Draft |publisher=Realcollegebasketball.com |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> and played for them until being traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in February 2014. Turner plays [[point guard]], [[shooting guard]], and [[small forward]] positions. He is considered a bust by many.\n\nIn 2010, Turner was a first-team [[2010 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-American]] and the National Player of the Year while playing at Ohio State University; he also became a two-time [[point (basketball)|scoring]] champion and the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] for the [[Big Ten Conference]]. He was twice the only unanimous selection for the All-Big Ten first team by both the coaches and the media (i.e., [[2008\u201309 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|2008\u201309]] and [[2009\u201310 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|2009\u201310]]). By finishing first in scoring and second in both rebounds and assists in the conference in the 2009\u201310 season, he was the first men's basketball player to finish in the top two in each of these categories and the first to finish in the top five in each category in the same season. He holds the conference record for most Conference Player of the Week awards, both in a career and in a single-season.\n\nTurner attended [[St. Joseph High School (Westchester, Illinois)|St. Joseph High School]] in [[Westchester, Illinois]].<ref name=Shccbbe/><ref name=2MBoI/> By his senior season, he was one of the top high school basketball players at his position in the nation.<ref name=ETe/><ref name=ETr/><ref name=ETs/> As a true freshman, he helped lead the Buckeyes to the [[2008 National Invitation Tournament]] championship. The following year, he was the Big Ten Conference scoring champion for the 2008\u201309 season and was a first-team 2009 All-Big Ten selection.<ref name=2BTCMBLs/><ref name=2ABTMBT/> That season, he was also an honorable mention All-American and was selected as a member of the [[2009 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|2009 All-Big Ten Conference Tournament team]],<ref name=MBLTC/> and he became one of five Big Ten players to have been among the top ten in the conference in average points, rebounds, and assists in the same season. He is the conference record-holder for most career Player of the Week awards and despite missing over a month of his junior season for the [[2009\u201310 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team]] he also set the single-season record for Player of the Week awards. As a pro, he has participated in the [[Rising Stars Challenge]] and helped the 76ers reach the [[NBA playoffs]] in his first two NBA seasons. During his third season he became an everyday starter. With an impending free agent status, he was traded to Indiana during his fourth season.\n\n==Early life==\nTurner was born weighing {{convert|10|lbs|kg}}. Within his first year, he endured [[chicken pox]], [[pneumonia]], [[asthma]], and [[measles]]. The 1989 Chicago measles epidemic caused Turner to desperately need [[emergency room]] services. He encountered severe breathing problems that required the removal of his [[adenoid]]s and [[tonsil]]s. At the age of three, he was hit by a car, resulting in a [[concussion]] and [[Surgical suture|stitches]]. Oversized baby teeth and an [[overbite]] caused a [[speech impediment]] that necessitated [[speech therapy]].<ref name=Tpttt>{{Cite

He is the conference record-holder for most career Player of the Week awards and despite missing over a month of his junior season for the [[2009\u201310 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team]] he also set the single-season record for Player of the Week awards. As a pro, he has participated in the [[Rising Stars Challenge]] and helped the 76ers reach the [[NBA playoffs]] in his first two NBA seasons. During his third season he became an everyday starter. With an impending free agent status, he was traded to Indiana during his fourth season.\n\n==Early life==\nTurner was born weighing {{convert|10|lbs|kg}}. Within his first year, he endured [[chicken pox]], [[pneumonia]], [[asthma]], and [[measles]]. The 1989 Chicago measles epidemic caused Turner to desperately need [[emergency room]] services. He encountered severe breathing problems that required the removal of his [[adenoid]]s and [[tonsil]]s. At the age of three, he was hit by a car, resulting in a [[concussion]] and [[Surgical suture|stitches]]. Oversized baby teeth and an [[overbite]] caused a [[speech impediment]] that necessitated [[speech therapy]].<ref name=Tpttt>{{Cite

Among other things, TheSpark.com featured a number of humorous self-quizzes and personality tests, including the four-variable [[Myers-Briggs]] style Match Test. SparkMatch debuted as a beta experiment of allowing registered users who had taken the Match Test to search for and contact each other based on their Match Test types. The popularity of SparkMatch took off and it was launched as its own site, later renamed OkCupid.

It was first recorded by [[Louis Armstrong]] and released in 1967 as a single, which topped the pop charts in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> Armstrong's recording was inducted in the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Q\u2013Z|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999. The publishing for this song is controlled by Memory Lane Music Group, [[Carlin America|Carlin Music Corp.]] and [[BMG Rights Management]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe song was written by producer Bob Thiele (as \"George Douglas\") and composer and performer George David Weiss.<ref name=PopHistoryDig>{{cite web|url=https://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/wonderful-world-armstrong |title=What A Wonderful World|publisher=The Pop History Dig |accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne source claims the song was first offered to [[Tony Bennett]], who turned it down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107105522/http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |title=Sundance Channel : Video: : SPECTACLE: Season 1 \u2013 Episode 5 (clip) |publisher=SundanceChannel.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nolajazzmuseum/videos/947138725493034/ |title=Ricky Riccardi: Video Pops What a Wonderful World\": The First Fifty Years |accessdate=4 August 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}}</ref> George Weiss recounts in the book ''Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting'' by [[Graham Nash]] that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong. Weiss was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring people of different races together. \n\nBecause he was gigging at the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana Hotel]], Armstrong recorded the song in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] at [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]]\u2019s United Recording studio. The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2&nbsp;am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger [[Artie Butler]] was there with songwriters Weiss and Theile, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra. Armstrong had recently signed to [[ABC Records]], and ABC president [[Larry Newton]] showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with [[Kapp Records]], so when Newton heard the slow pace of \"What a Wonderful World\", he tried to stop the session. Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 [[Pay scale|musicians union scale]] for his work.<ref name=PopHistoryDig/>\n\nThe song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Singles:  Six Decades of Hot Hits & Classic Cuts|last = Black|first = Johnny|publisher = Thunder Bay Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1592236510|location = |page = 97}}</ref> but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> In the United States, the song hit No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|Bubbling Under]] Chart. It was also the biggest-selling single of 1968 in the UK where it was among the last pop singles issued by HMV Records before becoming an exclusive classical music label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldogproductions.info/h/hmv-pop1001-1617.html |title=45 Discography for HMV Records \u2013 UK \u2013 POP series 1001\u20131617 |publisher=Globaldogproductions.info |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> The song made Armstrong the oldest male to top the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> Armstrong's record was broken in 2009 when a remake of \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" recorded for [[Comic Relief]]\u2014which included the 68-year-old [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]\u2014reached number one in that chart. [[Tony Bennett]] did go on to record \"What A Wonderful World\" several times, as in 2003 with [[k.d. lang]], paying homage to Bennett's friend, Armstrong.\n\nABC Records' European distributor [[EMI Records|EMI]] forced ABC to issue a ''What a Wonderful World'' album in 1968 (catalogue number ABCS-650). It did not chart in the United States, due to ABC not promoting it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/abc/abc600.html |title=ABC-Paramount Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> but charted in the UK where it was issued by [[Stateside Records]] with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at No. 37.\n\nThe song gradually became something of a standard and reached a new level of popularity. In 1978, it was featured in the closing scenes of BBC radio's, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and was repeated for BBC's 1981 [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV adaptation of the series]]. In 1988, Armstrong's recording appeared in the film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (despite the film being set in 1965 \u2013 two years before it was recorded) and was re-released as a single, hitting No. 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in February 1988. The single charted at number one for the fortnight ending June 27, 1988 on the [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s|Australian chart]]. It is also the closing song for the 1995 movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]''.\n\nIn 2001, rappers [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Raekwon]] and [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]] released \"The Forest,\" a song that begins with three lines of lyric adapted from \"What a Wonderful World\", altered to become \"an invitation to get high\" on marijuana.<ref name=Ghostface>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 |page=22 |title=Court: Ghostface Rap Was 'Fair Use' |last=Chang |first=Samantha |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2003 |volume=115 |issn=0006-2510 |issue=44}}</ref> The rappers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, were sued by the owners of \"What a Wonderful World,\" Abilene Music.

Georgian-British singer-songwriter [[Katie Melua]] recorded a version of the song with American singer and guitarist [[Eva Cassidy]], who had died in 1996.

by [[Bob Thiele]] (as \"George Douglas\") and [[George David Weiss]]. It was first recorded by [[Louis Armstrong]] and released in 1967 as a single, which topped the pop charts in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> Armstrong's recording was inducted in the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Q\u2013Z|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999. The publishing for this song is controlled by Memory Lane Music Group, [[Carlin America|Carlin Music Corp.]] and [[BMG Rights Management]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe song was written by producer Bob Thiele (as \"George Douglas\") and composer and performer George David Weiss.<ref name=PopHistoryDig>{{cite web|url=https://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/wonderful-world-armstrong |title=What A Wonderful World|publisher=The Pop History Dig |accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne source claims the song was first offered to [[Tony Bennett]], who turned it down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107105522/http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |title=Sundance Channel : Video: : SPECTACLE: Season 1 \u2013 Episode 5 (clip) |publisher=SundanceChannel.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nolajazzmuseum/videos/947138725493034/ |title=Ricky Riccardi: Video Pops What a Wonderful World\": The First Fifty Years |accessdate=4 August 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}}</ref> George Weiss recounts in the book ''Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting'' by [[Graham Nash]] that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong. Weiss was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring people of different races together. \n\nBecause he was gigging at the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana Hotel]], Armstrong recorded the song in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] at [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]]\u2019s United Recording studio. The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2&nbsp;am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger [[Artie Butler]] was there with songwriters Weiss and Theile, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra. Armstrong had recently signed to [[ABC Records]], and ABC president [[Larry Newton]] showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with [[Kapp Records]], so when Newton heard the slow pace of \"What a Wonderful World\", he tried to stop the session. Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 [[Pay scale|musicians union scale]] for his work.<ref name=PopHistoryDig/>\n\nThe song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Singles:  Six Decades of Hot Hits & Classic Cuts|last = Black|first = Johnny|publisher = Thunder Bay Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1592236510|location = |page = 97}}</ref> but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> In the United States, the song hit No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|Bubbling Under]] Chart. It was also the biggest-selling single of 1968 in the UK where it was among the last pop singles issued by HMV Records before becoming an exclusive classical music label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldogproductions.info/h/hmv-pop1001-1617.html |title=45 Discography for HMV Records \u2013 UK \u2013 POP series 1001\u20131617 |publisher=Globaldogproductions.info |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> The song made Armstrong the oldest male to top the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> Armstrong's record was broken in 2009 when a remake of \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" recorded for [[Comic Relief]]\u2014which included the 68-year-old [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]\u2014reached number one in that chart. [[Tony Bennett]] did go on to record \"What A Wonderful World\" several times, as in 2003 with [[k.d. lang]], paying homage to Bennett's friend, Armstrong.\n\nABC Records' European distributor [[EMI Records|EMI]] forced ABC to issue a ''What a Wonderful World'' album in 1968 (catalogue number ABCS-650). It did not chart in the United States, due to ABC not promoting it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/abc/abc600.html |title=ABC-Paramount Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> but charted in the UK where it was issued by [[Stateside Records]] with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at No. 37.\n\nThe song gradually became something of a standard and reached a new level of popularity. In 1978, it was featured in the closing scenes of BBC radio's, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and was repeated for BBC's 1981 [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV adaptation of the series]]. In 1988, Armstrong's recording appeared in the film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (despite the film being set in 1965 \u2013 two years before it was recorded) and was re-released as a single, hitting No. 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in February 1988. The single charted at number one for the fortnight ending June 27, 1988 on the [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s|Australian chart]]. It is also the closing song for the 1995 movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]''.\n\nIn 2001, rappers [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Raekwon]] and [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]] released \"The Forest,\" a song that begins with three lines of lyric adapted from \"What a Wonderful World\", altered to become \"an invitation to get high\" on marijuana.<ref name=Ghostface>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 |page=22 |title=Court: Ghostface Rap Was 'Fair Use' |last=Chang |first=Samantha |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2003 |volume=115 |issn=0006-2510 |issue=44}}</ref> The rappers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, were sued by the owners of \"What a Wonderful World,\" Abilene Music.

Georgian-British singer-songwriter [[Katie Melua]] recorded a version of the song with American singer and guitarist [[Eva Cassidy]], who had died in 1996. Recorded by Melua singing over the original Cassidy track, the duet was released in late 2007 as a charity single for the [[British Red Cross]].<ref name=\"evaweb\">{{cite web|url=http://evacassidy.org/katie-melua-page/|title=Katie Melua page|website=Eva Cassidy Web Site|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref> Melua, who considers Cassidy one of her musical idols, had previously sung with Cassidy in this manner on Christmas Eve 2006, when she performed \"[[Over the Rainbow#Eva Cassidy version|Over the Rainbow]]\" on the [[BBC One]] television program ''Duets Impossible'' with a videotape of Cassidy singing the song.<ref name=\"evaweb\"/>\n\nUpon its release, the single debuted at number 45 on the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish Singles Chart]] on the week of December 9, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-singles-chart/20071209/41/|title=Official Scottish Singles Sales Chart Top 100 09 December 2007 \u2013 15 December 2007|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref> The next week, the song rose 44 positions to number one while also debuting at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming both Cassidy's and Melua's first number-one single in the United Kingdom.
