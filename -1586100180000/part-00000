Lines represent [[single bond]]s; black spheres represent [[carbon]]; white spheres represent [[hydrogen]].]]\n\nPetroleum is a mixture of a very large number of different [[hydrocarbon]]s; the most commonly found molecules are [[alkane]]s (paraffins), [[cycloalkane]]s ([[naphthene]]s), [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, or more complicated chemicals like [[asphaltene]]s. Each petroleum variety has a unique mix of [[molecule]]s, which define its physical and chemical properties, like color and [[viscosity]].\n\nThe ''alkanes'', also known as ''paraffins'', are [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] hydrocarbons with straight or branched chains which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. They generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule, although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may be present in the mixture.\n\nThe alkanes from [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) to [[octane]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) are [[oil refinery|refined]] into gasoline, the ones from [[nonane]] (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>) to [[hexadecane]] (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>) into [[diesel fuel]], [[kerosene]] and [[jet fuel]]. Alkanes with more than 16 carbon atoms can be refined into [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. At the heavier end of the range, [[paraffin wax]] is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while [[asphalt]] has 35 and up, although these are usually [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracked]] by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand and the cost of recovery, these gases are either [[flare stack|flared off]], sold as [[liquefied petroleum gas]] under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapour pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.\n\nThe ''cycloalkanes'', also known as ''naphthenes'', are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.\n\nThe ''aromatic hydrocarbons'' are [[degree of unsaturation|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called [[benzene ring]]s, to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>. They tend to burn with a sooty flame, and many have a sweet aroma. Some are [[carcinogenic]].\n\nThese different molecules are separated by [[fractional distillation]] at an oil refinery to produce gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and other hydrocarbons. For example, [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (isooctane), widely used in [[gasoline]], has a chemical formula of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and it reacts with oxygen [[exothermic]]ally:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|title=Heat of Combustion of Fuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Webmo.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708085748/https://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n:2&nbsp;{{chem|C|8|H|18}}<sub>(''l'')</sub> + 25&nbsp;{{chem|O|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> \u2192 16&nbsp;{{chem|CO|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> + 18&nbsp;{{chem|H|2|O}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> (\u0394H = \u22125.51 MJ/mol of octane)\n\nThe number of various molecules in an oil sample can be determined by laboratory analysis.

This [[unresolved complex mixture|Unresolved Complex Mixture]] (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil.

Approximately 1 [[Metre|m]] below this sediment or{{clarify|date=December 2018}} water oxygen concentration was low, below 0.1&nbsp;mg/l, and [[Anoxic waters|anoxic conditions]] existed. Temperatures also remained constant.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs further layers settled to the sea or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions. This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]], found in various [[oil shale]]s around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s via a process known as [[Catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]]. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon [[pyrolysis]] in a variety of mainly [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reactions at high temperature or pressure, or both.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> These phases are described in detail below.\n\n;Anaerobic decay:\nIn the absence of plentiful oxygen, [[Aerobic organism|''aerobic'' bacteria]] were prevented from decaying the organic matter after it was buried under a layer of sediment or water. However, [[Anaerobic organism|''anaerobic'' bacteria]] were able to reduce [[sulfate]]s and [[nitrate]]s among the matter to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]] and [[Nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]] respectively by using the matter as a source for other reactants. Due to such anaerobic bacteria, at first this matter began to break apart mostly via [[hydrolysis]]: [[polysaccharide]]s and [[protein]]s were hydrolyzed to [[Monosaccharide|simple sugars]] and [[amino acid]]s respectively. These were further anaerobically [[Redox|oxidized]] at an accelerated rate by the [[enzyme]]s of the bacteria: e.g., amino acids went through [[oxidative deamination]] to [[imino acid]]s, which in turn reacted further to [[ammonia]] and [[Keto acid|\u03b1-keto acids]]. [[Monosaccharide]]s in turn ultimately decayed to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[methane]]. The anaerobic decay products of amino acids, monosaccharides, [[phenols]] and [[aldehyde]]s combined to [[fulvic acid]]s. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es were not extensively hydrolyzed under these mild conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n;Kerogen formation:\nSome phenolic compounds produced from previous reactions worked as [[bactericide]]s and the [[actinomycetales]] order of bacteria  also produced antibiotic compounds (e.g., [[streptomycin]]). Thus the action of anaerobic bacteria ceased at about 10 m below the water or sediment. The mixture at this depth contained fulvic acids, unreacted and partially reacted fats and waxes, slightly modified [[lignin]], resins and other hydrocarbons.<ref name=\":0\" /> As more layers of organic matter settled to the sea or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=R.L.|last2=Burnham|first2=A.K.|date=June 1993|title=Chemical reaction model for oil and gas generation from type 1 and type 2 kerogen|url=http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10169154-cT5xip/|journal=|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2172/10169154|via=}}</ref> As a consequence, compounds of this mixture began to combine in poorly understood ways to [[kerogen]]. Combination happened in a similar fashion as [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]] molecules react to [[Urea-formaldehyde|urea-formaldehyde resins]], but kerogen formation occurred in a more complex manner due to a bigger variety of reactants. The total process of kerogen formation from the beginning of anaerobic decay is called '''diagenesis''', a word that means a transformation of materials by dissolution and recombination of their constituents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Transformation of kerogen into fossil fuels:\nKerogen formation continued to the depth of about 1 [[Kilometre|km]] from the Earth's surface where temperatures may reach around 50 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. Kerogen formation represents a halfway point between organic matter and fossil fuels: kerogen can be exposed to oxygen, oxidize and thus be lost or it could be buried deeper inside the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] and be subjected to conditions which allow it to slowly transform into fossil fuels like petroleum. The latter happened through '''catagenesis''' in which the reactions were mostly [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[Rearrangement reaction|rearrangements]] of kerogen. These reactions took thousands to millions of years and no external reactants were involved. Due to radical nature of these reactions, kerogen reacted towards two classes of products: those with low H/C ratio ([[anthracene]] or products similar to it) and those with high H/C ratio ([[methane]] or products similar to it); i.e., carbon-rich or hydrogen-rich products. Because catagenesis was closed off from external reactants, the resulting composition of the fuel mixture was dependent on the composition of the kerogen via reaction [[stoichiometry]]. 3 main types of kerogen exist: type I (algal), II (liptinic) and III (humic), which were formed mainly from [[algae]], [[plankton]] and [[woody plant]]s (this term includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s) respectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCatagenesis was [[Pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] despite of the fact that it happened at relatively low temperatures (when compared to commercial pyrolysis plants) of 60 to several hundred \u00b0C. Pyrolysis was possible because of the long reaction times involved. Heat for catagenesis came from the decomposition of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials of the crust, especially [[Potassium-40|<sup>40</sup>K]], [[Thorium-232|<sup>232</sup>Th]], [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Uranium-238|<sup>238</sup>U]]. The heat varied with [[geothermal gradient]] and was typically 10-30&nbsp;\u00b0C per km of depth from the Earth's surface. Unusual [[magma]] intrusions, however, could have created greater localized heating.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGeologists often refer to the temperature range in which oil forms as an \"oil window\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xwLHnC9qMsgC&pg=PA104 |title=Polar Prospects:A minerals treaty for Antarctica |publisher=United States, Office of Technology Assessment |year=1989 |page=104 |isbn=978-1-4289-2232-7}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Below the minimum temperature oil remains trapped in the form of kerogen.

Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as [[oil reservoir|reservoirs]]) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an [[oil field]] forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by [[drill]]ing and [[pump]]ing.\n\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions. The latter set is regularly used in [[petrochemical]] plants and [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]].\n\nWells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil. \"Natural lift\" production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, such as in the Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using \"[[artificial lift]]\" means. Over time, these \"primary\" methods become less effective and \"secondary\" production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [[Water injection (oil production)|\"waterflood\"]] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or \"wellbore.\" Eventually \"tertiary\" or \"enhanced\" oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or \"bitumen\") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using \"in-situ\" methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping the liquid back out saturated with oil.\n\n===Unconventional oil reservoirs===\n{{See also|Unconventional oil|Oil sands|Oil shale reserves}}\nOil-eating bacteria [[biodegradation|biodegrade]] oil that has escaped to the surface. [[Oil sands]] are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present\u2014more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in [[Venezuela]]. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[oil shales]] are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called [[kerogen]]. The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes. The method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under British Crown Patent No. 330 covering, \"A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tar, and oil out of a sort of stone.\" Although oil shales are found in many countries, the United States has the world's largest deposits.<ref name=\"Lambertson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10092|title=Oil Shale: Ready to Unlock the Rock|last=Lambertson|first=Giles|date=February 16, 2008|work=|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711112037/http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/redirect/10092?story=10092|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=live|publisher=Construction Equipment Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Some [[Benchmark (crude oil)|marker crudes]] with their [[sulfur]] content (horizontal) and [[API gravity]] (vertical) and relative production quantity.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Brent shown as sweeter than WTI, yet most sources claim the opposite.

Crude oil may be considered ''[[Light crude oil|light]]'' if it has low density or ''[[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]'' if it has high density; and it may be referred to as [[sweet crude oil|sweet]] if it contains relatively little sulfur or ''[[sour crude oil|sour]]'' if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery. ''Light'' crude oil is more desirable than ''heavy'' oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while ''sweet'' oil commands a higher price than ''sour'' oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

The current reference, or pricing markers, are [[Brent Crude|Brent]], [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]], and [[Dubai Crude|Dubai/Oman]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oil in the 21st century : issues, challenges and opportunities|date=2006|publisher=Published by the Oxford University Press for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries|others=Mabro, Robert., Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries|isbn=978-0-19-920738-1|location=Oxford|page=351|oclc=77082224}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n{{Further|Petroleum product}}\nThe chemical structure of petroleum is [[Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]], composed of hydrocarbon chains of different lengths.

Offshore exploration and extraction of oil disturbs the surrounding marine environment.<ref>[http://www.offshore-environment.com/discharges.html Waste discharges during the offshore oil and gas activity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926140659/http://www.offshore-environment.com/discharges.html |date=September 26, 2009 }} by Stanislave Patin, tr.

Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]].\n\nOil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin [[oil slick]] which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly [[bulldozed]] around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.\n\nControl of oil spills is difficult, requires ad hoc methods, and often a large amount of manpower.

Lines represent [[single bond]]s; black spheres represent [[carbon]]; white spheres represent [[hydrogen]].]]\n\nPetroleum is a mixture of a very large number of different [[hydrocarbon]]s; the most commonly found molecules are [[alkane]]s (paraffins), [[cycloalkane]]s ([[naphthene]]s), [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, or more complicated chemicals like [[asphaltene]]s. Each petroleum variety has a unique mix of [[molecule]]s, which define its physical and chemical properties, like color and [[viscosity]].\n\nThe ''alkanes'', also known as ''paraffins'', are [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] hydrocarbons with straight or branched chains which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. They generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule, although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may be present in the mixture.\n\nThe alkanes from [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) to [[octane]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) are [[oil refinery|refined]] into gasoline, the ones from [[nonane]] (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>) to [[hexadecane]] (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>) into [[diesel fuel]], [[kerosene]] and [[jet fuel]]. Alkanes with more than 16 carbon atoms can be refined into [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. At the heavier end of the range, [[paraffin wax]] is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while [[asphalt]] has 35 and up, although these are usually [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracked]] by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand and the cost of recovery, these gases are either [[flare stack|flared off]], sold as [[liquefied petroleum gas]] under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapour pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.\n\nThe ''cycloalkanes'', also known as ''naphthenes'', are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.\n\nThe ''aromatic hydrocarbons'' are [[degree of unsaturation|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called [[benzene ring]]s, to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>. They tend to burn with a sooty flame, and many have a sweet aroma. Some are [[carcinogenic]].\n\nThese different molecules are separated by [[fractional distillation]] at an oil refinery to produce gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and other hydrocarbons. For example, [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (isooctane), widely used in [[gasoline]], has a chemical formula of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and it reacts with oxygen [[exothermic]]ally:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|title=Heat of Combustion of Fuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Webmo.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708085748/https://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n:2&nbsp;{{chem|C|8|H|18}}<sub>(''l'')</sub> + 25&nbsp;{{chem|O|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> \u2192 16&nbsp;{{chem|CO|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> + 18&nbsp;{{chem|H|2|O}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> (\u0394H = \u22125.51 MJ/mol of octane)\n\nThe number of various molecules in an oil sample can be determined by laboratory analysis.

This [[unresolved complex mixture|Unresolved Complex Mixture]] (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the [[water associated fraction]] of the oil.\n\nIncomplete combustion of petroleum or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts.

The total process of kerogen formation from the beginning of anaerobic decay is called '''diagenesis''', a word that means a transformation of materials by dissolution and recombination of their constituents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Transformation of kerogen into fossil fuels:\nKerogen formation continued to the depth of about 1 [[Kilometre|km]] from the Earth's surface where temperatures may reach around 50 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. Kerogen formation represents a halfway point between organic matter and fossil fuels: kerogen can be exposed to oxygen, oxidize and thus be lost or it could be buried deeper inside the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] and be subjected to conditions which allow it to slowly transform into fossil fuels like petroleum. The latter happened through '''catagenesis''' in which the reactions were mostly [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[Rearrangement reaction|rearrangements]] of kerogen. These reactions took thousands to millions of years and no external reactants were involved. Due to radical nature of these reactions, kerogen reacted towards two classes of products: those with low H/C ratio ([[anthracene]] or products similar to it) and those with high H/C ratio ([[methane]] or products similar to it); i.e., carbon-rich or hydrogen-rich products. Because catagenesis was closed off from external reactants, the resulting composition of the fuel mixture was dependent on the composition of the kerogen via reaction [[stoichiometry]]. 3 main types of kerogen exist: type I (algal), II (liptinic) and III (humic), which were formed mainly from [[algae]], [[plankton]] and [[woody plant]]s (this term includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s) respectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCatagenesis was [[Pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] despite of the fact that it happened at relatively low temperatures (when compared to commercial pyrolysis plants) of 60 to several hundred \u00b0C. Pyrolysis was possible because of the long reaction times involved. Heat for catagenesis came from the decomposition of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials of the crust, especially [[Potassium-40|<sup>40</sup>K]], [[Thorium-232|<sup>232</sup>Th]], [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Uranium-238|<sup>238</sup>U]]. The heat varied with [[geothermal gradient]] and was typically 10-30&nbsp;\u00b0C per km of depth from the Earth's surface. Unusual [[magma]] intrusions, however, could have created greater localized heating.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGeologists often refer to the temperature range in which oil forms as an \"oil window\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xwLHnC9qMsgC&pg=PA104 |title=Polar Prospects:A minerals treaty for Antarctica |publisher=United States, Office of Technology Assessment |year=1989 |page=104 |isbn=978-1-4289-2232-7}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Below the minimum temperature oil remains trapped in the form of kerogen. Above the maximum temperature the oil is converted to natural gas through the process of [[thermal cracking]]. Sometimes, oil formed at extreme depths may migrate and become trapped at a much shallower level. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] are one example of this.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Abiogenic petroleum ===\nAn alternative mechanism to the one described above was proposed by Russian scientists in the mid-1850s, the hypothesis of [[abiogenic petroleum origin]] (petroleum formed by inorganic means), but this is contradicted by geological and [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] evidence.<ref name=\"glasby2006\">{{cite journal |last=Glasby |first=Geoffrey P |date=2006 |title=Abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons: an historical overview |journal=Resource Geology |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=85\u201398 |url=http://static.scribd.com/docs/j79lhbgbjbqrb.pdf |accessdate=2008-01-29 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-3928.2006.tb00271.x |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224102502/http://static.scribd.com/docs/j79lhbgbjbqrb.pdf |archivedate=February 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Abiogenic sources of oil have been found, but never in commercially profitable amounts. \"The controversy isn't over whether abiogenic oil reserves exist,\" said Larry Nation of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. \"The controversy is over how much they contribute to Earth's overall reserves and how much time and effort geologists should devote to seeking them out.\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Live Science |title=The Mysterious Origin and Supply of Oil |url=http://www.livescience.com/9404-mysterious-origin-supply-oil.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127095201/http://www.livescience.com/9404-mysterious-origin-supply-oil.html |archivedate=January 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reservoirs==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Structural Trap (Anticlinal).svg|thumb|{{center|Hydrocarbon trap.}}]]\nThree conditions must be present for oil reservoirs to form:\n* a [[source rock]] rich in [[hydrocarbon]] material buried deeply enough for subterranean heat to cook it into oil,\n* a [[porous]] and [[permeability (fluid)|permeable]] reservoir rock where it can accumulate,\n* a [[caprock]] (seal) or other mechanism to prevent the oil from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as [[oil reservoir|reservoirs]]) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an [[oil field]] forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by [[drill]]ing and [[pump]]ing.\n\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions. The latter set is regularly used in [[petrochemical]] plants and [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]].\n\nWells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil. \"Natural lift\" production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, such as in the Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using \"[[artificial lift]]\" means. Over time, these \"primary\" methods become less effective and \"secondary\" production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [[Water injection (oil production)|\"waterflood\"]] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or \"wellbore.\" Eventually \"tertiary\" or \"enhanced\" oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or \"bitumen\") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using \"in-situ\" methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping the liquid back out saturated with oil.\n\n===Unconventional oil reservoirs===\n{{See also|Unconventional oil|Oil sands|Oil shale reserves}}\nOil-eating bacteria [[biodegradation|biodegrade]] oil that has escaped to the surface. [[Oil sands]] are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present\u2014more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in [[Venezuela]]. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[oil shales]] are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called [[kerogen]]. The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes. The method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under British Crown Patent No. 330 covering, \"A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tar, and oil out of a sort of stone.\" Although oil shales are found in many countries, the United States has the world's largest deposits.<ref name=\"Lambertson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10092|title=Oil Shale: Ready to Unlock the Rock|last=Lambertson|first=Giles|date=February 16, 2008|work=|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711112037/http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/redirect/10092?story=10092|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=live|publisher=Construction Equipment Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Some [[Benchmark (crude oil)|marker crudes]] with their [[sulfur]] content (horizontal) and [[API gravity]] (vertical) and relative production quantity.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Brent shown as sweeter than WTI, yet most sources claim the opposite.

Crude oil may be considered ''[[Light crude oil|light]]'' if it has low density or ''[[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]'' if it has high density; and it may be referred to as [[sweet crude oil|sweet]] if it contains relatively little sulfur or ''[[sour crude oil|sour]]'' if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery. ''Light'' crude oil is more desirable than ''heavy'' oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while ''sweet'' oil commands a higher price than ''sour'' oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]].\n\nOil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin [[oil slick]] which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly [[bulldozed]] around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.\n\nControl of oil spills is difficult, requires ad hoc methods, and often a large amount of manpower.
