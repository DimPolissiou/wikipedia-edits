It was released through Early Access on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] on December 13, 2013, and for Linux on November 22, 2014. Versions for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] were released in 2016 through [[Telltale Games|Telltale Publishing]].\n\n==Story==\nThe game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear [[Third World War]] that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, [[Arizona]]. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment, the developers hinted at a possible storyline that will be added in future updates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn \u201c7 Days to Die\u201d, the player spawns into a randomly-generated world or the preset world of Navezgane, Arizona, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible against the elements and the zombie hordes. As a survival game, the player character is in constant need of water and food for sustenance, as well as being vulnerable to injury and illness. The game is voxel-based (similar in some aspects to ''[[Minecraft]]''), allowing for simple building, and destruction of objects in a physics-simulated environment (for example, building a structure with no support such as pillars and walls can lead to its collapse).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/7-days-to-die-adds-crafting-and-voxels-to-your-post-apocalypse/|title=7 Days to Die adds crafting and voxels to your post-apocalyptic sandbox|first=Perry|last=Vandell|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-26-7-days-to-die-combines-a-voxel-based-sandbox-with-zombies|title=7 Days to Die combines a voxel-based sandbox with zombies|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Objects in the world degrade through use, so the player has to search for or make new tools as the game progresses.

Should they detect the player, zombies will apply the same single-minded pursuit until the player is either dead, or leaves the immediate area.\n\nThe game's title is a reference to an important event that occurs every seventh day of in-game time, whereby hordes of zombies attack the player's current location en masse\u2014unless sufficient preparation has been made and defences constructed, the player will quickly be overwhelmed.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer is available through player-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. Interactions can be cooperative or hostile depending on the used server options. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Players are also able to provide [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] support via single player worlds. ''7 Days to Die'' servers can run on consoles, Windows and Linux.<ref name=\"gamserversetup.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameserversetup.com/7-days-to-die-server-setup-guide/|title=7 Days to Die Server Setup|author=Nox|website=Game Server Setup|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> There are two supported game modes for multiplayer: Survival (both randomly generated and standard) and Creative.\n\n==Development==\nThe Windows alpha version of the game was released on August 16, 2013, for people who pre-ordered the game on either [[Kickstarter]] or [[PayPal]].

The console ports have not received any updates since December 2017.\n\n'''Updates'''\n\nThe Fun Pimps released a statement on 16 October 2019, stating:\n\n\"Many are speculating as to the future of 7 Days to Die on consoles and The Fun Pimps wanted to be as transparent as possible so here is the reality of the situation...\n\nAfter a long and tedious legal process in a closed auction, The Fun Pimps have re-acquired full console publishing rights on the current and all future versions of 7 Days to Die on PS4 and the Xbox One.\n\nWe know there still is a steady and healthy 7 Days console community, as we hear from them on our social media channels all the time and the game still has nearly 10,000 concurrent users playing the game on weekends.\n\nAs far as updates, the console has not gotten a meaningful update since July 2017, which was content and features from the Alpha 15 PC version.\n\nThe Fun Pimps are a PC game developer and publisher...and we do not have the resources or expertise to do ports/updates to the console, so we licensed the console publishing rights to Telltale Games who hired Iron Galaxy who have done the ports with minimal TFP assistance.\n\nWe all had a great thing going...a full Alpha 16 port was in the works, that is, until Telltale's insolvency broke the cadence of builds, hurt our sales, reputation and created this unfortunate situation. Instead of investing in a new update, TFP spent a very large sum of money regaining the rights back in an auction, in addition to ongoing legal and auditing fees...\n\nNow that we are the console publisher, as an operational business and out of obligation to our investors and our hard working team (who need to provide for their families too) we have to evaluate the expense and risk of porting any future versions of the game to consoles relative to the income it could generate. Full console ports cost into the millions of dollars, not to mention the restrictions the platform holders have on not breaking saved games which would be inevitable given our current framework and the technical challenges associated with porting a resource intensive game like 7 Days to consoles.\n\nWith Sony and Microsoft, no matter how small, any update has to go through a rigorous testing/submission process.\n\nAs you can see, this is not an easy problem to solve. We are exploring all options that would eventually deliver a new version of 7 Days to consoles but this would likely happen after the PC version has gone gold and could end up being an entirely new product or on the next console.\n\nPlease understand: Telltale going under has put the console version of 7 Days in this situation.

It was released through Early Access on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] on December 13, 2013, and for Linux on November 22, 2014. Versions for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] were released in 2016 through [[Telltale Games|Telltale Publishing]].\n\n==Story==\nThe game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear [[Third World War]] that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, [[Arizona]]. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment, the developers hinted at a possible storyline that will be added in future updates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn \u201c7 Days to Die\u201d, the player spawns into a randomly-generated world or the preset world of Navezgane, Arizona, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible against the elements and the zombie hordes. As a survival game, the player character is in constant need of water and food for sustenance, as well as being vulnerable to injury and illness. The game is voxel-based (similar in some aspects to ''[[Minecraft]]''), allowing for simple building, and destruction of objects in a physics-simulated environment (for example, building a structure with no support such as pillars and walls can lead to its collapse).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/7-days-to-die-adds-crafting-and-voxels-to-your-post-apocalypse/|title=7 Days to Die adds crafting and voxels to your post-apocalyptic sandbox|first=Perry|last=Vandell|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-26-7-days-to-die-combines-a-voxel-based-sandbox-with-zombies|title=7 Days to Die combines a voxel-based sandbox with zombies|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Objects in the world degrade through use, so the player has to search for or make new tools as the game progresses.

They are also drawn to areas of human (i.e. player) activity, and will relentlessly attack anything that impedes their movement until they are killed or the obstacle is destroyed\u2014this includes player fortifications. Should they detect the player, zombies will apply the same single-minded pursuit until the player is either dead, or leaves the immediate area.\n\nThe game's title is a reference to an important event that occurs every seventh day of in-game time, whereby hordes of zombies attack the player's current location en masse\u2014unless sufficient preparation has been made and defences constructed, the player will quickly be overwhelmed.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer is available through player-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. Interactions can be cooperative or hostile depending on the used server options. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Players are also able to provide [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] support via single player worlds. ''7 Days to Die'' servers can run on consoles, Windows and Linux.<ref name=\"gamserversetup.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameserversetup.com/7-days-to-die-server-setup-guide/|title=7 Days to Die Server Setup|author=Nox|website=Game Server Setup|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> There are two supported game modes for multiplayer: Survival (both randomly generated and standard) and Creative.\n\n==Development==\nThe Windows alpha version of the game was released on August 16, 2013, for people who pre-ordered the game on either [[Kickstarter]] or [[PayPal]].

The console ports have not received any updates since December 2017.\n\n'''Updates'''\n\nThe Fun Pimps released a statement on 16 October 2019, stating:\n\n\"Many are speculating as to the future of 7 Days to Die on consoles and The Fun Pimps wanted to be as transparent as possible so here is the reality of the situation...\n\nAfter a long and tedious legal process in a closed auction, The Fun Pimps have re-acquired full console publishing rights on the current and all future versions of 7 Days to Die on PS4 and the Xbox One.\n\nWe know there still is a steady and healthy 7 Days console community, as we hear from them on our social media channels all the time and the game still has nearly 10,000 concurrent users playing the game on weekends.\n\nAs far as updates, the console has not gotten a meaningful update since July 2017, which was content and features from the Alpha 15 PC version.\n\nThe Fun Pimps are a PC game developer and publisher...and we do not have the resources or expertise to do ports/updates to the console, so we licensed the console publishing rights to Telltale Games who hired Iron Galaxy who have done the ports with minimal TFP assistance.\n\nWe all had a great thing going...a full Alpha 16 port was in the works, that is, until Telltale's insolvency broke the cadence of builds, hurt our sales, reputation and created this unfortunate situation. Instead of investing in a new update, TFP spent a very large sum of money regaining the rights back in an auction, in addition to ongoing legal and auditing fees...\n\nNow that we are the console publisher, as an operational business and out of obligation to our investors and our hard working team (who need to provide for their families too) we have to evaluate the expense and risk of porting any future versions of the game to consoles relative to the income it could generate. Full console ports cost into the millions of dollars, not to mention the restrictions the platform holders have on not breaking saved games which would be inevitable given our current framework and the technical challenges associated with porting a resource intensive game like 7 Days to consoles.\n\nWith Sony and Microsoft, no matter how small, any update has to go through a rigorous testing/submission process.\n\nAs you can see, this is not an easy problem to solve. We are exploring all options that would eventually deliver a new version of 7 Days to consoles but this would likely happen after the PC version has gone gold and could end up being an entirely new product or on the next console.\n\nPlease understand: Telltale going under has put the console version of 7 Days in this situation. TFP are just trying to lookout for the future of our company and the game we care about...\n\nThe Fun Pimps will keep you updated as more information becomes available or if things change.\n\nWe thank you for all of the continued support.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://7daystodie.com/console-news/|title=Console News {{!}} 7 Days to Die|last=rhuenink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n{{Video game reviews\n| PS4 = true\n| XONE = true\n| na = true\n| Destruct_XONE = 3/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-7-days-to-die-374415.phtml|title=Review: 7 Days to Die (XOne)|first=Jordan|last=Devore|website=[[Destructoid]]|publisher=Enthusiast Gaming|date=July 11, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>\n| GMaster_PS4 = 48%<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die (PS4)|magazine=[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=74}}</ref>\n| GSpot_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/7-days-to-die-review/1900-6416470/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Joab|last=Gilroy|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN_XONE = 4.9/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review|title=7 Days to Die Review (Xbox One)|first=Leif|last=Johnson|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>\n| OPMUK_PS4 = 5/10<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die|magazine=[[PlayStation Official Magazine \u2013 UK]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=103}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''The Digital Fix''\n| rev1_XONE = 4/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/3655/7-days-to-die/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Peter|last=Taylor|website=The Digital Fix|publisher=Poisonous Monkey|date=July 19, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722114842/http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/3655/7-days-to-die.html|archivedate=July 22, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''\n| rev2_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/05/7-days-to-die-review-undead-on-arrival-5987378/|title=7 Days To Die review - undead on arrival (XOne)|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|date=July 5, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n| MC_PS4 = 45/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/7-days-to-die|title=7 Days to Die for PlayStation 4 Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n| MC_XONE = 35/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/7-days-to-die|title=7 Days to Die for Xbox One Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of ''7 Days to Die'' received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" />\n\nAs of June 2018 the game scored a \"very positive\" review by over 46,000 reviews on Steam<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/|title=7 Days to Die|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]}}</ref> and was one of the \"Top 100 Selling games of 2017\" on Steam, despite still being in alpha stage development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/02/biggest-steam-games-2017/|title=These are the top 100 Steam games of 2017|first=Alec|last=Meer|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://7daystodie.com/}}\n* {{moby game|id=/7-days-to-die}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Horror video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Kickstarter-funded video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic video games]]\n[[Category:Steam Greenlight games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Zombie video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "Natt39", "label": "safe", "comment": "No longer requires distinction in publisher for consoles", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_to_Die"}
{"title_page": "Tzaraath", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{short description|Disfigurative conditions of the skin, clothing and houses}}\n{{Tumah and taharah|expanded=Miscellaneous}}\n'''''Tzaraath''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea {{IPA-he|tsa\u02c8\u0281a(\u0294)at|}}, [[Romanization|Romanized]] [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''\u1e63\u0101ra\u02bba\u1e6f''' and numerous variants of [[English language|English]] [[transliteration]], including ''saraath'', ''tzaraas'', ''tzaraat'', ''tsaraas'' and ''tsaraat'') describes disfigurative conditions of the skin, hair of the beard and head, clothing made of linen or wool, or stones of homes located in the [[land of Israel]]. All variations are mainly referred to in chapters 13\u201314 of [[Leviticus]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe noun form comes from the verb ''tzara'' (\u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2) which means \"to have a skin disease.\" The [[root word|linguistic root]] of ''tzaraath'' may mean \"smiting\", in comparison with Arabic, in reference to a Talmudical explanation that it serves as a punishment for [[sin]];<ref name=\"EncBib\">Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref> it is quite possible that ''tzaraath'' was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> and the [[Talmud]] maintains a similar view, arguing that ''tzaraath'' referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin.<ref>Sifra 60a</ref>\n\n== Translations ==\nThe [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] [[Torah]] text describes three variations of ''tzaraath'' affecting the skin: \u05e9\u05d0\u05ea, \u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea (Se'eth, Sapachath and Bahereth). The [[Septuagint]], a translation of the Hebrew Bible originally used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] and Gentile [[proselytes]], translates the term ''tzaraath'' with Greek ''lepra'' (\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1), from which the cognate \"[[leprosy]]\" was traditionally used in English Bibles. The classical Greek term ''lepra'' stems from the noun ''lepis'' \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (a scale (of a fish), which in turn stems from the verb ''lep\u00f3'' \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 (to peel), hence leprosy (literally, morbid scaliness).<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon article \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03b1 , Ion. \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03c1\u03b7 , \u1f21, (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2) cites \"A. leprosy, which makes the skin scaly, [[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' 1.138, [[Hippocrates]] ''Aphorisms'' 3.20 (plural), Prorrh.2.43 (pl.), Epid.5.9 (sg.), Morb.1.3 (sg.), Arist.Pr.887a34, [[Theophrastus]] ''Characters'' 19.2, Sud.14, [[LXX]] Leviticus 13.2.</ref> The JPS Tanakh translates it as a \"scaly affection\" in Leviticus 13:2.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] describes instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy ([[Luke 5]]:10), although the precise relationship between this, ''tzaraath'', and Hansen's disease is not established.\n\n== Torah ==\nThe Torah identifies three manifestations of ''tzaraath'': as an affliction of human skin,<ref>Leviticus 13:2</ref> of garments,<ref>Leviticus 13:47</ref> and of houses.<ref>Leviticus 14:34</ref> The Torah also speaks of ''tzaraath'' on two other occasions, one in reference to [[Moses]] and the other in reference to his sister, [[Miriam]]. In Exodus 4:6\u20137, when Moses is standing before the [[burning bush]], he doubts that Jews will believe that he is the messenger of God. God provides him with two signs to prove his mission: turning his rod into a snake and then back into a rod and turning his hand into being stricken with ''tzaraath'' and then back again. Moses revealed these wonders to the elders in Exodus 4:30.\n\nIn Numbers 12:10, Miriam was stricken with ''tzaraath'' for her involvement in slandering Moses. [[Aaron]] asks Moses to cure her via extraordinary means, because he claims that he, as her own brother, cannot examine, confine or purify her. Moses prays for his sister and she is cured of the ''tzaraath'' but must remain in confinement for seven days. The Torah, however, does not indicate that she went through any purification process similar to what is normally required.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some (such as [[ArtScroll|ArtScroll/Mesorah]]) the three subdivisions of skin ''tzaraath'' are best left transliterated, rather than translated, because there are no equivalent English terms and any attempt to translate them greatly diminishes the distinctiveness and focus of the [[Hebrew]] term. Though this is not the view of the [[Jewish Publication Society]] nor of the [[Bible Society]]. Additionally, a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' is not to be performed by anyone but a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest).\n\nSome say the manifestation of ''tzaraath'' is termed a ''negah'' (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2) \"affliction\", ''nega'im'' (plural: \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd) and there are three varieties of ''nega'im'' that relate to human flesh, two of which are:\n#boils and burns (Leviticus 13:18\u201328)\n#bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, the ''negah'' of which is called a \u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 (''netek'') (Leviticus 13:29\u201344)\n\n=== Purification ===\n:\"The ''kohen'' shall command to take for the person undergoing purification (the ''metzora'') two live [[kosher]] birds, cedarwood, red string and [[ezov|hyssop]].\" ({{Bibleverse|Leviticus|14:4|HE}})\n\nSpring water is placed in an earthenware vessel, over which one of the birds is slaughtered and into which the blood is allowed to run. The ''kohen'' then dips the remaining bird and other items into the bloodied water and sprinkles the ''metzora'' seven times on the back of the hand. Some say the sprinkling was done onto his or her forehead.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:1</ref> The identical procedure was performed for a house struck by ''tzaraath'', with the sprinkling done on the [[lintel]]. The slaughtered bird was buried in the presence of the ''metzora'' and the live bird was freed into the open field.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\" />\n\nThe ''metzora'' washes their garments from impurity and [[tonsure|shaves off all their hair]], save for that located in places similar to those in which ''nega'im'' are not subject to impurity (Mishnah Nega'im 2:4) The ''metzora'' then waits for seven days to begin the final steps of his or her purification ceremony (Leviticus 14:8\u20139). On the seventh day, the ''metzora'' again washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and again shaves off all of his or her hair. (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:3) On the eighth day, the ''metzora'' brings three animal sacrifices to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: a sin offering of a female [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and a guilt offering and a burnt offering, both of male lambs (Leviticus 14:10).\n\nBlood from the slaughtered guilt offering was placed on the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:14) The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the ''metzora'' was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds. To reconcile this dilemma, the ''metzora'' stuck these body parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood. The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the ''metzora''. If the ''metzora'' lost any of these body parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:9).\n\n== Rabbinic interpretation ==\nThe laws of ''tzaraath'' are dealt with in Mishnah [[Nega'im]].\n\n=== Patches of the skin ===\nPatches of the skin are confirmed as ''tzaraath'' by the occurrence of one of three signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:3</ref>\n# white hair (\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df) \u2013 if at least two hairs within the confines of the ''negah'' turn white<ref name=\"lev3-10\">Leviticus 13:10</ref>\n# healthy flesh (\u05d5\u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9) \u2013 if skin of a normal appearance appears within the confines of the patch<ref name=\"lev3-10\"/>\n# spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the patch became enlarged since the time of the initial examination by the Kohen<ref>Leviticus 13:7</ref>\n\nWhereas baldness is not a form of ''tzaraath'', patches that occur on a bald scalp may be ''tzaraath'' if they meet the criteria as mentioned by the Torah. Such an eruption on a bald scalp must appear in a distinct fashion but is regulated by rules similar to that of ''nega'im'' on the skin; however, it can only occur on men. For a scalp eruption to be ''tzaraath'', the lesion must be a white patch tinged with red (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd).<ref>Leviticus 13:42</ref> This can occur in one of two places: within what are referred to as a man's posterior baldness (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea) and anterior baldness (\u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea).\n\nIf someone cuts off some skin or a part of his body to remove a ''negah'', he becomes impure, even if he had no confirming signs. He may become pure only after another ''negah'' forms.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref> The exception is when a ''negah'' appears on the tip of the [[foreskin]] and is cut off during [[circumcision]], which is permitted, because a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\"/>\n\n=== Boils and burns ===\nBoils and burns, as occur naturally as a result of an [[abscess]], blunt force trauma or thermal insult to the skin, are not ''tzaraath'' and do not carry impurity. During the healing phases of these wounds, however, if certain signs that mimic those of the aforementioned patches appear, ''tzaraath'' may occur. Confirmation is by the occurrence of one of two signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:4</ref>\n#white hair (\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05df and \u05e0\u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:20 and 13:25)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 and \u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:22 and 13:27)\n\n=== Bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard ===\nThe initial symptom of this type of ''negah'' is patches of hair loss. According to [[Maimonides]], scalp and beard ''nega'im'' are characterized by hair loss without any change to the skin of the bald spot <ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Mishnah Torah]], ''Taharah'', ''Hilchot Tuma'at Tzaraath'' 8:1</ref> The [[Tosefta]], however, maintains that the skin of the bald spot does indeed become altered in a ''negah''. There are two confirming signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:5</ref>\n#thin yellow hair (\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e7) \u2013 if at least two and a half hairs from within the bald patch turn yellow (Leviticus 13:30)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the balding spreads, according to Maimonides. According to [[Abraham ben David]], who quotes the Tosefta, this spreading would refer to spreading of a skin change as well (Leviticus 13:36).\n\n=== Inspection of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, and ''tzaraath'' determination ===\nFor all of the different types of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, there is a similar protocol put in place by the Torah for determining whether or not the skin eruption is indeed ''tzaraath''. The individual with the eruption must visit a ''[[kohen]]'', who is a male possessing direct lineage to [[Aaron]], who was the [[kohen gadol|High Priest]] and brother of [[Moses]]. The ''kohen'', trained in examining lesions and diagnosing ''tzaraath'', will examine the lesion and determine whether or not it meets the specifications of ''tzaraath''. Specifically, he will evaluate the lesion for the criteria mentioned above, except of course for the final criterion of spreading, which can only be diagnosed at a follow-up examination, should one be necessary. If during the initial examination, the characteristics of the lesion meet the criteria for ''tzaraath'', the ''kohen'' will declare the individual ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). (Leviticus 13:3, 20, 25, 30)\n\nIf the criteria are not met by the lesion during the initial examination by the ''kohen'', the individual is confined in his home for seven days, pending a follow-up examination (Leviticus 13:4, 21, 26, 31) If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' are again not met and the lesion has not spread, there is a difference in protocol depending of the type of lesion.\n* For patches of the skin, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.<ref>Leviticus 13:5,</ref>\n* For boils or burns, the ''kohen'' declares it merely a \u05e6\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea (''tzarevet'', \"scar\") and there are no further examinations (Leviticus 13:23 and 28)\n* For bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, another confinement period of seven days is imposed. However, prior to this second confinement period, the individual is shaved around the ''nesek'' (\u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u2013 \"he should be shaved but the ''nesek'' should not be shaved), leaving a rim of two hairs completely surrounding the bald spot to make any spreading recognizable<ref>Leviticus 13:33 + associated commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> (especially according to Maimonides, who asserts that these lesions manifest as pure hair loss without any concomitant skin eruption.)\n\nAfter the second confinement period of seven days, both those with patches on the skin as well as those with bald patches are re-evaluated once more.<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\">Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref> If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have still not been met, the afflicted individual is declared ''tahor'' (\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \"ritually pure\").<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> He or she, does, however, have to wash both his or her body and garments;<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> due to the confinement, he or she is considered impure in some sense.<ref>Leviticus 13:6, commentary by Rashi</ref>\n\nIf the ''negah'' was declared ritually pure and later it spread, it must be shown once again to a ''kohen'', who will then declare it ''tzaraath''.<ref>Leviticus 13:7\u20138 and 35\u201336</ref>\nThere are many other regulations regarding the inspection:\n* The ''kohen'' must be able to see the entirety of the lesion. Thus, if the skin eruption or bald spot wraps around either the body or body parts, or occurs at the tip of terminal body parts\u2014any place that would preclude the observation of the entire lesion at one time (i.e. wrapping around the torso, scalp or arm, or occurring at the tip of a finger or toe) \u2013 there can be no declaration of ''tzaraath''.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 6:7</ref>\n* In a similar vein, a ''kohen'' who is blind in one eye or who cannot see well may not perform the inspections.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:3</ref> An eligible ''kohen'' may inspect anyone, including his relatives, except himself.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:5</ref> However, it is not necessary that a ''kohen'' perform the inspection; anyone who is proficient in the laws of ''nega'im'' may perform the examination. However, only a ''kohen'' may declare purity or impurity. A non-''kohen'' examiner may inform an accompanying inexpert ''kohen'' of his determination that a ''negah'' is or is not ''tzaraath'' and the ''kohen'' declares \"purity\" or \"impurity\".<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render impurity on parts of the body that are naturally concealed by other parts of the body according to specific regulations. For skin eruptions on the legs, men are inspected standing as though they are hoeing and women standing as though they are rolling dough. For eruptions on the arms, men raise their arms as though they are picking olives and women raising their arms as though they are weaving or spinning.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 2:4\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render [[gentile]]s impure.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\"/>\n* A groom is exempt from visiting the ''kohen'' until the eighth day after his wedding for any ''nega'im'' on his flesh, garments or house. Similarly, there are no inspections carried out on the days of [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] or [[Sukkot]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:2</ref>\n* Even on the days when inspections are performed, they are only allowed for two hours each day: during the fourth and eighth hour of the day (corresponding roughly to 9\u201310 AM and 2\u20133 PM).<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:2</ref>\n\nIf, however, the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have been met, either during the initial exam or at either of the two follow-ups (when applicable) or even after a previous declaration of purity, the individual is declared ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). The individual is declared impure even if the lesion did not worsen or spread but remained the same\u2014the skin eruption must become dimmer in appearance for it to be declared pure at the second follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 + commentary of Rashi</ref>\n\n=== The ''metzora'': management of ''tzaraath'' of human flesh ===\nThe individual who is declared impure with ''tzaraath'' is referred to as either<ref>Leviticus 13:44 and 14:2, respectively</ref> a ''tzarua'' (\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2) or a ''metzora'' (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2). The ''metzora'' is shunned and must live alone outside the confines of the community (Leviticus 13:46) The ''metzora'' tears his or her garments in mourning like those who are in [[sitting shiva|mourning]] for a close family member and does not cut his or her hair.  The ''metzora'' must also cover his or her face until the upper lip in the fashion of mourners, and he or she calls out \"impure, impure\" to warn others to keep their distance ([[Rashi]] Commentary on Leviticus 13:45).\n\nThe ''metzora'' remains confined outside of the community until his ''tzaraath'' vanishes. The ''metzora'' is evaluated by a ''kohen'', who leaves the community to examine him. When the ''kohen'' observes the resolution of the ''tzaraath'', he begins a procedure that ultimately reverses the impure status of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:4).\n\n=== Interpretations ===\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] clams that ''tzaraath'' was not to be interpreted as a medical malady, but rather as a spiritual affliction. The verse itself arguably suggests this, as it directs those who find themselves afflicted to seek out a ''Kohen'' (priest) and not a doctor, while the Torah does permit and even encourages those who are in need of medical care to seek treatment from physicians.<ref>[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21:19</ref>\n\nThe Torah's emphasis is clearly on the ''tu{{'}}mah'' (\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \"ritual impurity \") that results from a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' because the verses focus on the ''kohen''{{'}}s declaration of \"unclean\" \u2013 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 (\"The ''kohen'' will see [the eruption] and [declare] him impure\").\n\nThe Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards ''tzaraath'' as a [[punishment]] for [[sin]]; it lists seven possible causes for ''tzaraath'':<ref>[[Talmud]] Arachin 16a</ref>\n* an ''[[lashon hara|evil tongue]]'' (malicious [[gossip]]) (elsewhere, this is supported by the wordplay ''metzora'' (leper) - ''motzi [shem] ra'' (slanderer)<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Vayikra_Rabbah.16.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Vayikra Rabbah 16:2]</ref>)\n* [[murder]]\n* a vain [[oath]]\n* illicit sexual intercourse\n* [[pride]]\n* [[theft]]\n* [[miser]]ly behavior\n\nOne ''[[midrash]]ic'' source categorically states that ''tzaraath'' only appeared as punishment for ''evil tongue'', while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from ''tzaraath'' only came about through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. In particular, the [[Midrash Rabba]] sees the different types of ''tzaraath'' as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:\n#the first stage in the Rabbah's view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it only required removal of the affected stones for a cure.\n#in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away, and the infection came upon one's clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure.\n#in the third stage of Rabbah's scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person's skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur.\n#in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to dwell alone.\n\nOther [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical writers]] saw ''tzaraath'' of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserliness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside prior to confinement.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> On the other hand, [[Rashi]], basing his view on the [[Leviticus Rabbah]],<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'' 17:6</ref> states that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a reward for the homeowner, arguing that the [[Israelite]] homes had previously been those of [[Canaanites]], who had hidden their valuables in the walls; the ''tzaraath'' required the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there.<ref>Leviticus 14:34, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\nRather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of ''tzaraath'' in the manner of modern doctors, [[classical rabbinical literature]] took an extremely literal view.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the [[Mishnah]] argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered ''tzaraath'';<ref>Nega'im, 8:4</ref> similarly since the biblical text mentions ''tzaraath'' occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate ''tzaraath'', and that if the boil or burn subsequently heals, it still doesn't indicate ''tzaraath'', unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body not previously diseased.<ref>Nega'im, 9:2</ref> The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a [[lentil]], those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those that occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those that occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate ''tzaraath''.<ref>Nega'im 8:1</ref><ref>Nega'im 6:8</ref>\n\nThe items used in the purification ritual were specifically included to deliver a message to the ''metzora''. The sin most associated with ''tzaraath'' is ''[[lashon hara]]'' (an \"evil tongue\",<ref name=a16>''[[Babylonian Talmud|Bavli]]'' ''[[Arachin]]'' 16b</ref> to speak derogatorily about others consistently to one's friends is likened to birds, who chatter endlessly.<ref name=a16/> In a similar vein, the one who speaks ill of others is haughty, holding himself or herself high above others and is likened to the tall [[Cedrus libani|cedar]]. To be healed, the ''metzora'' must erase arrogance, making themselves lowly like a worm. This is a play on words\u2014the word ''tola'as'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea) means both \"red\" and \"worm\" \u2013 as well as hyssop.\n\nThe remaining portion of the olive oil from the purification offering, called in Hebrew ''log shemen shel metzora'', is retained by the ''kohen'' at the completion of his service. This portion is listed as one of the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]].\n\n== Affliction of clothing ==\n''Tzaraath'' can also afflict garments ([[Leviticus]] 13:47). Garment ''tzaraath'' is relevant to only three materials:\n# [[wool]] (Hebrew \u05e6\u05de\u05e8)\n# [[linen]] (Hebrew \u05e4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd)\n# Two types of [[leather]] are indicated in Leviticus 13:48:\n## unworked leather (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8)\n## finished leather (\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, literally \"all worked leather\")\n\nIn a wool or linen garment, the ''tzaraath'' may appear as a uniformly existing ''negah'' within the material or as a ''negah'' limited to either only the [[weft|woof]] or [[warp (weaving)|warp]] (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1) of the garment (Leviticus 13:48).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to ''tzaraath'' as it applies to clothing:\n* Clothing belonging to a [[gentile]] are insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only sheep's wool is susceptible to a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'', although an even mixture of sheep's wool and another type of wool (camel's wool, for example) can be afflicted.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref> In a similar vein, a mixture of plant fibers containing linen is insusceptible unless it is at least half linen.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\"/>\n* The leather referred to by the Torah does not include the hides of marine animals.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:1</ref>\n* The fabric of wool or linen or leather article cannot be rendered impure by ''tzaraath'' if it is artificially dyed. If, however, the item is naturally colored (such as wool from a black sheep), it can be rendered impure.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:3</ref>\n\n=== Appearance, inspection and management of ''tzaraath'' in clothing ===\n''Tzaraath'' appears in clothing as an intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7 \u2013 ''yerakrak'') or red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd \u2013 ''adamdam'') eruption,<ref>Leviticus 13:49</ref> and must be brought to the ''[[kohen]]'' for inspection. In regards to garment ''tzaraath'', there are no criteria by which it can be declared impure upon initial examination. The garment is confined for seven days, and if on the seventh day, the ''negah'' has spread, it is a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'' and is declared impure.<ref>Leviticus 13:51</ref> Subsequent to a declaration of ''tzaraath'', the garment, whether wool, linen or leather, is completely burnt (\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3); if the ''tzaraath'' was confined to the woof or warp, only that need be burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:52</ref>\n\nUpon re-evaluation after the seven-day confinement, the ''kohen'' may instruct that the garment with the eruption be washed and confined once more for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 13:54</ref> If upon a second re-evaluation after the second seven days of confinement, the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption did not dim and did not spread, the garment is declared impure and must be completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:55</ref>\n\nIf the second re-evaluation reveals a dimming of the eruption, the ''kohen'' tears the area with the eruption from the garment and burns the torn out portion completely.<ref>Leviticus 13:56, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> The torn out area is patched to allow for a reinspection of the area for return of the ''negah''.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref> If, the eruption returns to the patch, there is no confinement period instituted and the entire garment is completely burnt.;<ref>Leviticus 13:57, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> if a ''negah'' reappears on the garment but not on the patch, the garment must be burned but the patch can be saved.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:6</ref> To recapitulate, if the ''negah'' remained as it was after the first week of confinement, it is washed and reconfined. If it remained as it was after the second week of confinement, it is burned.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\"/>\n\nIf, however, upon the second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' disappears, the garment must be immersed in a ''[[mikveh]]'' (\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4, \"ritual bath\") and is then pure.<ref>Leviticus 13:58, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\n== Affliction of housing ==\nThe third and last type of ''tzaraath'' mentioned by the Torah affects buildings.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 14:34</ref> If an individual notices an affliction on his house, he is to inform a ''[[kohen]]''. The ''kohen'' will then command that they empty the house of all of its contents prior to his inspection; this is to prevent further financial loss, because should the house be confined, everything within it became impure as well.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\">Leviticus 14:36</ref>\n\nWhen the ''kohen'' comes to perform the inspection, he looks for lesions on the wall that appear either intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05ea) or intense red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05de\u05ea) and that appear sunken below the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the wall's surface (\u05e9\u05e4\u05dc \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05e8, literally \"lower than the wall\"). If this is what he sees, the ''kohen'' exits the house and confines it for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 14:38</ref>\n\nOn the seventh day, upon re-evaluating the eruption, if the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption has spread beyond what it had been, the afflicted stones are removed, the area around the afflicted stones is scraped and both the removed stones and clay plaster are cast into a place of impurity.<ref>Leviticus 14:40-1</ref> At least two afflicted stones are necessary for removal of any stones and at least two new stones must be used to fill the void.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref> If the afflicted wall is shared by two houses owned by two neighbors, both neighbors must help to remove the afflicted stones, scrape and place the new stones, but only the owner of the house whose interior was afflicted performs the replastering. It is from this ruling that the [[proverb]] ''Oy l'rasha, oy l'scheino'' (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d5, \"Woe to the wicked! Woe to his neighbor!\") originates.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\"/>\n\nThe void is filled with new stones and clay plaster and the house is confined for another seven days. If upon a second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' has returned after new stones have been plastered in, the ''negah'' is deemed ''tzaraath'' and the entire house must be dismantled.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> If the ''negah'' does not return, the house is pronounced pure, and the same purification process mentioned in relation to ''tzaraath'' of human flesh is employed here.\n\nThere are numerous limitations put on the ''tzaraath'' that afflicts houses:\n* The house of a [[gentile]] is insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only houses that possess four walls and four corners are susceptible. Similarly, only those houses that rest on the ground are susceptible, to the exclusion of those that are suspended above ground or are built on a boat.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:1</ref>\n* ''Tzaraath'' only affects houses that are built entirely out of stones, wood and clay plaster. If any of the four walls are built or internally overlaid with [[marble]], natural outcropping of rock, [[brick]] or earthen soil, that wall is insusceptible to ''tzaraath'', and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four walls are susceptible.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:2</ref>\n* Two storey houses are treated as two distinct houses and the beams that serve as the floor of the upper storey and the roof of the lower storey are allowed to remain with whichever house remains.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 13:3</ref>\n* Houses are the only buildings that are susceptible to ''tzaraath'' (not, for example, barns or cattle stalls) and only houses that exist within the region of land originally divided among the 12 tribes, because the verse refers to ''beis eretz achuzaschem'' (\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6\u05ea\u05db\u05dd, \"a house of the land of your inheritance\"); this also excludes houses in [[Jerusalem]], because it was not given as an inheritance to any one tribe, but rather held jointly by all of [[Children of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:4, commentary of [[Pinchas Kehati]]</ref>\n\n== Modern medical interpretations ==\n[[File:Buki ben yogli.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ukrainian Jew|Ukrainian-Jewish]] born [[Yehuda L.

group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\u201332|}}, starting at ''After this...''</ref> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref> The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath'', also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from ''tzaraath'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:49\u201353|}}</ref> however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath''.\n\nThe first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and [[ezov]], into the blood;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20136|}}</ref> this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref> Once the surviving bird was released over open fields,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\"/> and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref> According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of [[sympathetic magic]], with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away;<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\nIn the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people),<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\"/> after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their [[eyebrow]]s, and then wash themselves.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9|}}</ref> Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard [[whole offering]], a standard [[sin offering]] (to excuse the profanity of having had ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>), and a [[guilt offering]] (to apologise for the cause of the ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>);<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:10\u201320|}}</ref> if people are too [[poverty|poor]] to afford that, the Bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used instead.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:21\u201332|}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other guilt offerings, the priest was required to put some of the blood from the sacrifice onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right [[thumb]], and right big [[toe]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:14}}</ref> then some of the oil for the sacrifice had to be poured into the priest's left palm, and applied with the priest's right forefinger onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:15\u201317}}</ref> and then the rest of the oil from the priest's palm was to be poured onto the formerly infected person's head;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:18}}</ref> critical scholars regard the Priestly Code, of which the ''tzaraath'' regulations are a part, to have been written in the early 7th century,<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref> and it is in this context that these additional rules have significance. By that era, non-priests were not allowed to pass beyond a certain gateway (the gate of Nicanor) in the complex at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], while the blood from sacrifices couldn't pass outside, thus for a person to be touched by the blood, they had to lean through the gateway without setting foot on the other side; the right ear, thumb, and toe, were symbolically the parts of the body that achieve this.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Metzora (parsha)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com/2006/02/tzaraas_24.html Tzara'as] (from [http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com Reb Chaim HaQoton])\n* [http://www.jbooks.com/interviews/index/IP_Cohen_Tzaraat.htm A Rough Guide to ''Tzaraat'' by Joshua Cohen]\n* [https://archive.is/20130218010206/http://www.cairn.info/revue-corps-2008-2-p-33.htm?WhatU=barg%C3%A8s&Auteur=&doc=&ID_ARTICLE=CORP_005_0033 Impuret\u00e9, contagion et alliance \u00e0 travers la l\u00e8pre, Tsara'at ]\n\n[[Category:Jewish ritual purity law]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{short description|Disfigurative conditions of the skin, clothing and houses}}\n{{Tumah and taharah|expanded=Miscellaneous}}\n'''''Tzaraath''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea {{IPA-he|tsa\u02c8\u0281a(\u0294)at|}}, [[Romanization|Romanized]] [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''\u1e63\u0101ra\u02bba\u1e6f''' and numerous variants of [[English language|English]] [[transliteration]], including ''saraath'', ''tzaraas'', ''tzaraat'', ''tsaraas'' and ''tsaraat'') describes disfigurative conditions of the skin, hair of the beard and head, clothing made of linen or wool, or stones of homes located in the [[land of Israel]]. All variations are mainly referred to in chapters 13\u201314 of [[Leviticus]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe noun form comes from the verb ''tzara'' (\u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2) which means \"to have a skin disease.\" The [[root word|linguistic root]] of ''tzaraath'' may mean \"smiting\", in comparison with Arabic, in reference to a Talmudical explanation that it serves as a punishment for [[sin]];<ref name=\"EncBib\">Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref> it is quite possible that ''tzaraath'' was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> and the [[Talmud]] maintains a similar view, arguing that ''tzaraath'' referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin.<ref>Sifra 60a</ref>\n\n== Translations ==\nThe [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] [[Torah]] text describes three variations of ''tzaraath'' affecting the skin: \u05e9\u05d0\u05ea, \u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea (Se'eth, Sapachath and Bahereth). The [[Septuagint]], a translation of the Hebrew Bible originally used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] and Gentile [[proselytes]], translates the term ''tzaraath'' with Greek ''lepra'' (\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1), from which the cognate \"[[leprosy]]\" was traditionally used in English Bibles. The classical Greek term ''lepra'' stems from the noun ''lepis'' \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (a scale (of a fish), which in turn stems from the verb ''lep\u00f3'' \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 (to peel), hence leprosy (literally, morbid scaliness).<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon article \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03b1 , Ion. \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03c1\u03b7 , \u1f21, (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2) cites \"A. leprosy, which makes the skin scaly, [[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' 1.138, [[Hippocrates]] ''Aphorisms'' 3.20 (plural), Prorrh.2.43 (pl.), Epid.5.9 (sg.), Morb.1.3 (sg.), Arist.Pr.887a34, [[Theophrastus]] ''Characters'' 19.2, Sud.14, [[LXX]] Leviticus 13.2.</ref> The JPS Tanakh translates it as a \"scaly affection\" in Leviticus 13:2.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] describes instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy ([[Luke 5]]:10), although the precise relationship between this, ''tzaraath'', and Hansen's disease is not established.\n\n== Torah ==\nThe Torah identifies three manifestations of ''tzaraath'': as an affliction of human skin,<ref>Leviticus 13:2</ref> of garments,<ref>Leviticus 13:47</ref> and of houses.<ref>Leviticus 14:34</ref> The Torah also speaks of ''tzaraath'' on two other occasions, one in reference to [[Moses]] and the other in reference to his sister, [[Miriam]]. In Exodus 4:6\u20137, when Moses is standing before the [[burning bush]], he doubts that Jews will believe that he is the messenger of God. God provides him with two signs to prove his mission: turning his rod into a snake and then back into a rod and turning his hand into being stricken with ''tzaraath'' and then back again. Moses revealed these wonders to the elders in Exodus 4:30.\n\nIn Numbers 12:10, Miriam was stricken with ''tzaraath'' for her involvement in slandering Moses. [[Aaron]] asks Moses to cure her via extraordinary means, because he claims that he, as her own brother, cannot examine, confine or purify her. Moses prays for his sister and she is cured of the ''tzaraath'' but must remain in confinement for seven days. The Torah, however, does not indicate that she went through any purification process similar to what is normally required.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some (such as [[ArtScroll|ArtScroll/Mesorah]]) the three subdivisions of skin ''tzaraath'' are best left transliterated, rather than translated, because there are no equivalent English terms and any attempt to translate them greatly diminishes the distinctiveness and focus of the [[Hebrew]] term. Though this is not the view of the [[Jewish Publication Society]] nor of the [[Bible Society]]. Additionally, a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' is not to be performed by anyone but a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest).\n\nSome say the manifestation of ''tzaraath'' is termed a ''negah'' (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2) \"affliction\", ''nega'im'' (plural: \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd) and there are three varieties of ''nega'im'' that relate to human flesh, two of which are:\n#boils and burns (Leviticus 13:18\u201328)\n#bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, the ''negah'' of which is called a \u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 (''netek'') (Leviticus 13:29\u201344)\n\n=== Purification ===\n:\"The ''kohen'' shall command to take for the person undergoing purification (the ''metzora'') two live [[kosher]] birds, cedarwood, red string and [[ezov|hyssop]].\" ({{Bibleverse|Leviticus|14:4|HE}})\n\nSpring water is placed in an earthenware vessel, over which one of the birds is slaughtered and into which the blood is allowed to run. The ''kohen'' then dips the remaining bird and other items into the bloodied water and sprinkles the ''metzora'' seven times on the back of the hand. Some say the sprinkling was done onto his or her forehead.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:1</ref> The identical procedure was performed for a house struck by ''tzaraath'', with the sprinkling done on the [[lintel]]. The slaughtered bird was buried in the presence of the ''metzora'' and the live bird was freed into the open field.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\" />\n\nThe ''metzora'' washes their garments from impurity and [[tonsure|shaves off all their hair]], save for that located in places similar to those in which ''nega'im'' are not subject to impurity (Mishnah Nega'im 2:4) The ''metzora'' then waits for seven days to begin the final steps of his or her purification ceremony (Leviticus 14:8\u20139). On the seventh day, the ''metzora'' again washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and again shaves off all of his or her hair. (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:3) On the eighth day, the ''metzora'' brings three animal sacrifices to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: a sin offering of a female [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and a guilt offering and a burnt offering, both of male lambs (Leviticus 14:10).\n\nBlood from the slaughtered guilt offering was placed on the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:14) The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the ''metzora'' was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds. To reconcile this dilemma, the ''metzora'' stuck these body parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood. The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the ''metzora''. If the ''metzora'' lost any of these body parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:9).\n\n== Rabbinic interpretation ==\nThe laws of ''tzaraath'' are dealt with in Mishnah [[Nega'im]].\n\n=== Patches of the skin ===\nPatches of the skin are confirmed as ''tzaraath'' by the occurrence of one of three signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:3</ref>\n# white hair (\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df) \u2013 if at least two hairs within the confines of the ''negah'' turn white<ref name=\"lev3-10\">Leviticus 13:10</ref>\n# healthy flesh (\u05d5\u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9) \u2013 if skin of a normal appearance appears within the confines of the patch<ref name=\"lev3-10\"/>\n# spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the patch became enlarged since the time of the initial examination by the Kohen<ref>Leviticus 13:7</ref>\n\nWhereas baldness is not a form of ''tzaraath'', patches that occur on a bald scalp may be ''tzaraath'' if they meet the criteria as mentioned by the Torah. Such an eruption on a bald scalp must appear in a distinct fashion but is regulated by rules similar to that of ''nega'im'' on the skin; however, it can only occur on men. For a scalp eruption to be ''tzaraath'', the lesion must be a white patch tinged with red (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd).<ref>Leviticus 13:42</ref> This can occur in one of two places: within what are referred to as a man's posterior baldness (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea) and anterior baldness (\u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea).\n\nIf someone cuts off some skin or a part of his body to remove a ''negah'', he becomes impure, even if he had no confirming signs. He may become pure only after another ''negah'' forms.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref> The exception is when a ''negah'' appears on the tip of the [[foreskin]] and is cut off during [[circumcision]], which is permitted, because a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\"/>\n\n=== Boils and burns ===\nBoils and burns, as occur naturally as a result of an [[abscess]], blunt force trauma or thermal insult to the skin, are not ''tzaraath'' and do not carry impurity. During the healing phases of these wounds, however, if certain signs that mimic those of the aforementioned patches appear, ''tzaraath'' may occur. Confirmation is by the occurrence of one of two signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:4</ref>\n#white hair (\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05df and \u05e0\u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:20 and 13:25)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 and \u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:22 and 13:27)\n\n=== Bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard ===\nThe initial symptom of this type of ''negah'' is patches of hair loss. According to [[Maimonides]], scalp and beard ''nega'im'' are characterized by hair loss without any change to the skin of the bald spot <ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Mishnah Torah]], ''Taharah'', ''Hilchot Tuma'at Tzaraath'' 8:1</ref> The [[Tosefta]], however, maintains that the skin of the bald spot does indeed become altered in a ''negah''. There are two confirming signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:5</ref>\n#thin yellow hair (\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e7) \u2013 if at least two and a half hairs from within the bald patch turn yellow (Leviticus 13:30)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the balding spreads, according to Maimonides. According to [[Abraham ben David]], who quotes the Tosefta, this spreading would refer to spreading of a skin change as well (Leviticus 13:36).\n\n=== Inspection of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, and ''tzaraath'' determination ===\nFor all of the different types of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, there is a similar protocol put in place by the Torah for determining whether or not the skin eruption is indeed ''tzaraath''. The individual with the eruption must visit a ''[[kohen]]'', who is a male possessing direct lineage to [[Aaron]], who was the [[kohen gadol|High Priest]] and brother of [[Moses]]. The ''kohen'', trained in examining lesions and diagnosing ''tzaraath'', will examine the lesion and determine whether or not it meets the specifications of ''tzaraath''. Specifically, he will evaluate the lesion for the criteria mentioned above, except of course for the final criterion of spreading, which can only be diagnosed at a follow-up examination, should one be necessary. If during the initial examination, the characteristics of the lesion meet the criteria for ''tzaraath'', the ''kohen'' will declare the individual ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). (Leviticus 13:3, 20, 25, 30)\n\nIf the criteria are not met by the lesion during the initial examination by the ''kohen'', the individual is confined in his home for seven days, pending a follow-up examination (Leviticus 13:4, 21, 26, 31) If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' are again not met and the lesion has not spread, there is a difference in protocol depending of the type of lesion.\n* For patches of the skin, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.<ref>Leviticus 13:5,</ref>\n* For boils or burns, the ''kohen'' declares it merely a \u05e6\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea (''tzarevet'', \"scar\") and there are no further examinations (Leviticus 13:23 and 28)\n* For bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, another confinement period of seven days is imposed. However, prior to this second confinement period, the individual is shaved around the ''nesek'' (\u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u2013 \"he should be shaved but the ''nesek'' should not be shaved), leaving a rim of two hairs completely surrounding the bald spot to make any spreading recognizable<ref>Leviticus 13:33 + associated commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> (especially according to Maimonides, who asserts that these lesions manifest as pure hair loss without any concomitant skin eruption.)\n\nAfter the second confinement period of seven days, both those with patches on the skin as well as those with bald patches are re-evaluated once more.<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\">Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref> If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have still not been met, the afflicted individual is declared ''tahor'' (\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \"ritually pure\").<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> He or she, does, however, have to wash both his or her body and garments;<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> due to the confinement, he or she is considered impure in some sense.<ref>Leviticus 13:6, commentary by Rashi</ref>\n\nIf the ''negah'' was declared ritually pure and later it spread, it must be shown once again to a ''kohen'', who will then declare it ''tzaraath''.<ref>Leviticus 13:7\u20138 and 35\u201336</ref>\nThere are many other regulations regarding the inspection:\n* The ''kohen'' must be able to see the entirety of the lesion. Thus, if the skin eruption or bald spot wraps around either the body or body parts, or occurs at the tip of terminal body parts\u2014any place that would preclude the observation of the entire lesion at one time (i.e. wrapping around the torso, scalp or arm, or occurring at the tip of a finger or toe) \u2013 there can be no declaration of ''tzaraath''.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 6:7</ref>\n* In a similar vein, a ''kohen'' who is blind in one eye or who cannot see well may not perform the inspections.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:3</ref> An eligible ''kohen'' may inspect anyone, including his relatives, except himself.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:5</ref> However, it is not necessary that a ''kohen'' perform the inspection; anyone who is proficient in the laws of ''nega'im'' may perform the examination. However, only a ''kohen'' may declare purity or impurity. A non-''kohen'' examiner may inform an accompanying inexpert ''kohen'' of his determination that a ''negah'' is or is not ''tzaraath'' and the ''kohen'' declares \"purity\" or \"impurity\".<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render impurity on parts of the body that are naturally concealed by other parts of the body according to specific regulations. For skin eruptions on the legs, men are inspected standing as though they are hoeing and women standing as though they are rolling dough. For eruptions on the arms, men raise their arms as though they are picking olives and women raising their arms as though they are weaving or spinning.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 2:4\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render [[gentile]]s impure.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\"/>\n* A groom is exempt from visiting the ''kohen'' until the eighth day after his wedding for any ''nega'im'' on his flesh, garments or house. Similarly, there are no inspections carried out on the days of [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] or [[Sukkot]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:2</ref>\n* Even on the days when inspections are performed, they are only allowed for two hours each day: during the fourth and eighth hour of the day (corresponding roughly to 9\u201310 AM and 2\u20133 PM).<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:2</ref>\n\nIf, however, the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have been met, either during the initial exam or at either of the two follow-ups (when applicable) or even after a previous declaration of purity, the individual is declared ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). The individual is declared impure even if the lesion did not worsen or spread but remained the same\u2014the skin eruption must become dimmer in appearance for it to be declared pure at the second follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 + commentary of Rashi</ref>\n\n=== The ''metzora'': management of ''tzaraath'' of human flesh ===\nThe individual who is declared impure with ''tzaraath'' is referred to as either<ref>Leviticus 13:44 and 14:2, respectively</ref> a ''tzarua'' (\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2) or a ''metzora'' (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2). The ''metzora'' is shunned and must live alone outside the confines of the community (Leviticus 13:46) The ''metzora'' tears his or her garments in mourning like those who are in [[sitting shiva|mourning]] for a close family member and does not cut his or her hair.  The ''metzora'' must also cover his or her face until the upper lip in the fashion of mourners, and he or she calls out \"impure, impure\" to warn others to keep their distance ([[Rashi]] Commentary on Leviticus 13:45).\n\nThe ''metzora'' remains confined outside of the community until his ''tzaraath'' vanishes. The ''metzora'' is evaluated by a ''kohen'', who leaves the community to examine him. When the ''kohen'' observes the resolution of the ''tzaraath'', he begins a procedure that ultimately reverses the impure status of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:4).\n\n===Interpretations===\n[[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch]] clams that ''tzaraath'' was not to be interpreted as a medical malady, but rather as a spiritual affliction. The verse itself arguably suggests this, as it directs those who find themselves afflicted to seek out a ''Kohen'' (priest) and not a doctor, while the Torah does permit and even encourages those who are in need of medical care to seek treatment from physicians.<ref>[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21:19</ref>\n\nThe Torah's emphasis is clearly on the ''tu{{'}}mah'' (\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \"ritual impurity \") that results from a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' because the verses focus on the ''kohen''{{'}}s declaration of \"unclean\" \u2013 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 (\"The ''kohen'' will see [the eruption] and [declare] him impure\").\n\nThe Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards ''tzaraath'' as a [[punishment]] for [[sin]]; it lists seven possible causes for ''tzaraath'':<ref>[[Talmud]] Arachin 16a</ref>\n* an ''[[lashon hara|evil tongue]]'' (malicious [[gossip]]) (elsewhere, this is supported by the wordplay ''metzora'' (leper) - ''motzi [shem] ra'' (slanderer)<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Vayikra_Rabbah.16.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Vayikra Rabbah 16:2]</ref>)\n* [[murder]]\n* a vain [[oath]]\n* illicit sexual intercourse\n* [[pride]]\n* [[theft]]\n* [[miser]]ly behavior\n\nOne ''[[midrash]]ic'' source categorically states that ''tzaraath'' only appeared as punishment for ''evil tongue'', while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from ''tzaraath'' only came about through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. In particular, the [[Midrash Rabba]] sees the different types of ''tzaraath'' as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:\n#the first stage in the Rabbah's view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it only required removal of the affected stones for a cure.\n#in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away, and the infection came upon one's clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure.\n#in the third stage of Rabbah's scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person's skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur.\n#in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to dwell alone.\n\nOther [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical writers]] saw ''tzaraath'' of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserliness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside prior to confinement.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> On the other hand, [[Rashi]], basing his view on the [[Leviticus Rabbah]],<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'' 17:6</ref> states that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a reward for the homeowner, arguing that the [[Israelite]] homes had previously been those of [[Canaanites]], who had hidden their valuables in the walls; the ''tzaraath'' required the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there.<ref>Leviticus 14:34, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\nRather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of ''tzaraath'' in the manner of modern doctors, [[classical rabbinical literature]] took an extremely literal view.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the [[Mishnah]] argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered ''tzaraath'';<ref>Nega'im, 8:4</ref> similarly since the biblical text mentions ''tzaraath'' occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate ''tzaraath'', and that if the boil or burn subsequently heals, it still doesn't indicate ''tzaraath'', unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body not previously diseased.<ref>Nega'im, 9:2</ref> The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a [[lentil]], those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those that occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those that occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate ''tzaraath''.<ref>Nega'im 8:1</ref><ref>Nega'im 6:8</ref>\n\nThe items used in the purification ritual were specifically included to deliver a message to the ''metzora''. The sin most associated with ''tzaraath'' is ''[[lashon hara]]'' (an \"evil tongue\",<ref name=a16>''[[Babylonian Talmud|Bavli]]'' ''[[Arachin]]'' 16b</ref> to speak derogatorily about others consistently to one's friends is likened to birds, who chatter endlessly.<ref name=a16/> In a similar vein, the one who speaks ill of others is haughty, holding himself or herself high above others and is likened to the tall [[Cedrus libani|cedar]]. To be healed, the ''metzora'' must erase arrogance, making themselves lowly like a worm. This is a play on words\u2014the word ''tola'as'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea) means both \"red\" and \"worm\" \u2013 as well as hyssop.\n\nThe remaining portion of the olive oil from the purification offering, called in Hebrew ''log shemen shel metzora'', is retained by the ''kohen'' at the completion of his service. This portion is listed as one of the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]].\n\n== Affliction of clothing ==\n''Tzaraath'' can also afflict garments ([[Leviticus]] 13:47). Garment ''tzaraath'' is relevant to only three materials:\n# [[wool]] (Hebrew \u05e6\u05de\u05e8)\n# [[linen]] (Hebrew \u05e4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd)\n# Two types of [[leather]] are indicated in Leviticus 13:48:\n## unworked leather (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8)\n## finished leather (\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, literally \"all worked leather\")\n\nIn a wool or linen garment, the ''tzaraath'' may appear as a uniformly existing ''negah'' within the material or as a ''negah'' limited to either only the [[weft|woof]] or [[warp (weaving)|warp]] (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1) of the garment (Leviticus 13:48).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to ''tzaraath'' as it applies to clothing:\n* Clothing belonging to a [[gentile]] are insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only sheep's wool is susceptible to a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'', although an even mixture of sheep's wool and another type of wool (camel's wool, for example) can be afflicted.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref> In a similar vein, a mixture of plant fibers containing linen is insusceptible unless it is at least half linen.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\"/>\n* The leather referred to by the Torah does not include the hides of marine animals.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:1</ref>\n* The fabric of wool or linen or leather article cannot be rendered impure by ''tzaraath'' if it is artificially dyed. If, however, the item is naturally colored (such as wool from a black sheep), it can be rendered impure.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:3</ref>\n\n=== Appearance, inspection and management of ''tzaraath'' in clothing ===\n''Tzaraath'' appears in clothing as an intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7 \u2013 ''yerakrak'') or red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd \u2013 ''adamdam'') eruption,<ref>Leviticus 13:49</ref> and must be brought to the ''[[kohen]]'' for inspection. In regards to garment ''tzaraath'', there are no criteria by which it can be declared impure upon initial examination. The garment is confined for seven days, and if on the seventh day, the ''negah'' has spread, it is a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'' and is declared impure.<ref>Leviticus 13:51</ref> Subsequent to a declaration of ''tzaraath'', the garment, whether wool, linen or leather, is completely burnt (\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3); if the ''tzaraath'' was confined to the woof or warp, only that need be burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:52</ref>\n\nUpon re-evaluation after the seven-day confinement, the ''kohen'' may instruct that the garment with the eruption be washed and confined once more for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 13:54</ref> If upon a second re-evaluation after the second seven days of confinement, the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption did not dim and did not spread, the garment is declared impure and must be completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:55</ref>\n\nIf the second re-evaluation reveals a dimming of the eruption, the ''kohen'' tears the area with the eruption from the garment and burns the torn out portion completely.<ref>Leviticus 13:56, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> The torn out area is patched to allow for a reinspection of the area for return of the ''negah''.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref> If, the eruption returns to the patch, there is no confinement period instituted and the entire garment is completely burnt.;<ref>Leviticus 13:57, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> if a ''negah'' reappears on the garment but not on the patch, the garment must be burned but the patch can be saved.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:6</ref> To recapitulate, if the ''negah'' remained as it was after the first week of confinement, it is washed and reconfined. If it remained as it was after the second week of confinement, it is burned.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\"/>\n\nIf, however, upon the second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' disappears, the garment must be immersed in a ''[[mikveh]]'' (\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4, \"ritual bath\") and is then pure.<ref>Leviticus 13:58, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\n== Affliction of housing ==\nThe third and last type of ''tzaraath'' mentioned by the Torah affects buildings.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 14:34</ref> If an individual notices an affliction on his house, he is to inform a ''[[kohen]]''. The ''kohen'' will then command that they empty the house of all of its contents prior to his inspection; this is to prevent further financial loss, because should the house be confined, everything within it became impure as well.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\">Leviticus 14:36</ref>\n\nWhen the ''kohen'' comes to perform the inspection, he looks for lesions on the wall that appear either intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05ea) or intense red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05de\u05ea) and that appear sunken below the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the wall's surface (\u05e9\u05e4\u05dc \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05e8, literally \"lower than the wall\"). If this is what he sees, the ''kohen'' exits the house and confines it for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 14:38</ref>\n\nOn the seventh day, upon re-evaluating the eruption, if the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption has spread beyond what it had been, the afflicted stones are removed, the area around the afflicted stones is scraped and both the removed stones and clay plaster are cast into a place of impurity.<ref>Leviticus 14:40-1</ref> At least two afflicted stones are necessary for removal of any stones and at least two new stones must be used to fill the void.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref> If the afflicted wall is shared by two houses owned by two neighbors, both neighbors must help to remove the afflicted stones, scrape and place the new stones, but only the owner of the house whose interior was afflicted performs the replastering. It is from this ruling that the [[proverb]] ''Oy l'rasha, oy l'scheino'' (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d5, \"Woe to the wicked! Woe to his neighbor!\") originates.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\"/>\n\nThe void is filled with new stones and clay plaster and the house is confined for another seven days. If upon a second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' has returned after new stones have been plastered in, the ''negah'' is deemed ''tzaraath'' and the entire house must be dismantled.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> If the ''negah'' does not return, the house is pronounced pure, and the same purification process mentioned in relation to ''tzaraath'' of human flesh is employed here.\n\nThere are numerous limitations put on the ''tzaraath'' that afflicts houses:\n* The house of a [[gentile]] is insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only houses that possess four walls and four corners are susceptible. Similarly, only those houses that rest on the ground are susceptible, to the exclusion of those that are suspended above ground or are built on a boat.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:1</ref>\n* ''Tzaraath'' only affects houses that are built entirely out of stones, wood and clay plaster. If any of the four walls are built or internally overlaid with [[marble]], natural outcropping of rock, [[brick]] or earthen soil, that wall is insusceptible to ''tzaraath'', and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four walls are susceptible.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:2</ref>\n* Two storey houses are treated as two distinct houses and the beams that serve as the floor of the upper storey and the roof of the lower storey are allowed to remain with whichever house remains.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 13:3</ref>\n* Houses are the only buildings that are susceptible to ''tzaraath'' (not, for example, barns or cattle stalls) and only houses that exist within the region of land originally divided among the 12 tribes, because the verse refers to ''beis eretz achuzaschem'' (\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6\u05ea\u05db\u05dd, \"a house of the land of your inheritance\"); this also excludes houses in [[Jerusalem]], because it was not given as an inheritance to any one tribe, but rather held jointly by all of [[Children of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:4, commentary of [[Pinchas Kehati]]</ref>\n\n==Modern medical interpretations==\n[[File:Buki ben yogli.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ukrainian Jew|Ukrainian-Jewish]] born [[Yehuda L.

group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\u201332|}}, starting at ''After this...''</ref> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref> The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath'', also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from ''tzaraath'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:49\u201353|}}</ref> however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath''.\n\nThe first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and [[ezov]], into the blood;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20136|}}</ref> this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref> Once the surviving bird was released over open fields,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\"/> and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref> According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of [[sympathetic magic]], with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away;<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\nIn the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people),<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\"/> after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their [[eyebrow]]s, and then wash themselves.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9|}}</ref> Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard [[whole offering]], a standard [[sin offering]] (to excuse the profanity of having had ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>), and a [[guilt offering]] (to apologise for the cause of the ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>);<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:10\u201320|}}</ref> if people are too [[poverty|poor]] to afford that, the Bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used instead.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:21\u201332|}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other guilt offerings, the priest was required to put some of the blood from the sacrifice onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right [[thumb]], and right big [[toe]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:14}}</ref> then some of the oil for the sacrifice had to be poured into the priest's left palm, and applied with the priest's right forefinger onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:15\u201317}}</ref> and then the rest of the oil from the priest's palm was to be poured onto the formerly infected person's head;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:18}}</ref> critical scholars regard the Priestly Code, of which the ''tzaraath'' regulations are a part, to have been written in the early 7th century,<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref> and it is in this context that these additional rules have significance. By that era, non-priests were not allowed to pass beyond a certain gateway (the gate of Nicanor) in the complex at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], while the blood from sacrifices couldn't pass outside, thus for a person to be touched by the blood, they had to lean through the gateway without setting foot on the other side; the right ear, thumb, and toe, were symbolically the parts of the body that achieve this.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Metzora (parsha)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com/2006/02/tzaraas_24.html Tzara'as] (from [http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com Reb Chaim HaQoton])\n* [http://www.jbooks.com/interviews/index/IP_Cohen_Tzaraat.htm A Rough Guide to ''Tzaraat'' by Joshua Cohen]\n* [https://archive.is/20130218010206/http://www.cairn.info/revue-corps-2008-2-p-33.htm?WhatU=barg%C3%A8s&Auteur=&doc=&ID_ARTICLE=CORP_005_0033 Impuret\u00e9, contagion et alliance \u00e0 travers la l\u00e8pre, Tsara'at ]\n\n[[Category:Jewish ritual purity law]]\n", "name_user": "Debresser", "label": "safe", "comment": "Consistency, avoid pipe.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath"}

[[product line]] of [[Lego]] construction toys produced by [[The Lego Group]] based around a central concept. \n\nBefore 1978, Lego produced several construction sets based around a subject but not necessarily branded as part of a single series or theme. Following the introduction of [[Lego minifigures|minifigures]] in 1978, owner [[Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen]] pushed a new strategy of creating and marketing a series of sets he termed a \"system within the system\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lego.com/en-us/lego-history/lego-space-840679f3440c4de8ba6ce7783708808a |title=Lego Space |website=Lego |access-date=January 30, 2020 |quote=In 1978, LEGO owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen introduces a new business model: the \u201cSystem within the System\u201d.}}</ref> and the three original themes were launched: [[Lego City|Town]], [[Lego Castle|Castle]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lego.com/en-us/lego-history/lego-castle-4db0fbd1812943f2a1c46d8e11b2a314 |title=Lego Castle |website=Lego |access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> and [[Lego Space|Space]].<ref name=HallofFame>{{cite web|title=LEGO Legend Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen to be Inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame |publisher=[[Toy Industry Association]] |date=2008-02-11 |url=http://www.toyassociation.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Whats_the_Buzz |work=What's the Buzz |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229090110/http://www.toyassociation.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Whats_the_Buzz |archivedate=2008-02-29 }}</ref> In the 1980s, Lego created subthemes within the three ongoing themes with factions and coherent designs, as well as introducing branding that identified the set as part of a theme. The company also produced themes that used pieces outside of the standard Lego System such as [[Lego Technic|Technic]] and [[Lego Fabuland|Fabuland]]. Since then, many new themes have been introduced and discontinued, including the inclusion of [[licensed]] themes in 1999 such as [[Lego Star Wars|''Star Wars'']]. Not all sets produced are necessarily part of any official theme including store exclusive sets, one-off licensed sets, and most advanced construction sets released prior to the introduction of [[Lego Creator#Expert|Creator Expert]].\n\n==Current themes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

It is a {{circa}} {{convert|30|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} mountain with an up-to-{{convert|8|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} [[caldera]] and [[parasitic vent]]s. Most of the volcano is formed by [[trachytic]] [[lava flow]]s, but [[hyaloclastite]] is also found. Snow, ice, and [[glacier]]s cover most of Mount Takahe; formerly it was thought that it had formed below ice. With a volume of {{Convert|780|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] are probably even larger. It is within the [[West Antarctic Rift System]] along with eighteen other known volcanoes.\n\nThe volcano was active in the [[Quaternary]]. [[Radiometric dating]] has yielded ages of 300,000{{nbsp}}years and less for its rocks. The fast-growing volcano reached its present height about 200,000 years ago. A number of [[tephra]] layers encountered in [[ice core]]s at [[Mount Waesche]] and [[Byrd Station]] have been attributed to Mount Takahe, although some of them were later linked to eruptions of [[Mount Berlin]] instead. The tephra layers were formed by [[explosive eruption|explosive]] or [[phreatomagmatic]] eruptions.

With a volume of {{Convert|780|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] are probably even larger. It is within the [[West Antarctic Rift System]] along with eighteen other known volcanoes.\n\nThe volcano was active in the [[Quaternary]]. [[Radiometric dating]] has yielded ages of 300,000{{nbsp}}years and less for its rocks. The fast-growing volcano reached its present height about 200,000 years ago. A number of [[tephra]] layers encountered in [[ice core]]s at [[Mount Waesche]] and [[Byrd Station]] have been attributed to Mount Takahe, although some of them were later linked to eruptions of [[Mount Berlin]] instead. The tephra layers were formed by [[explosive eruption|explosive]] or [[phreatomagmatic]] eruptions. Major eruptions took place around 17,700{{nbsp}}years ago\u2014which perhaps formed an [[ozone hole]] over Antarctica\u2014and in the early [[Holocene]], although late Holocene eruptions are also possible.
