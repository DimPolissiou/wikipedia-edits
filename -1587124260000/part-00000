London: Rivingtons, 1898, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vqgYAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=Monasterium+Fabariense&source=bl&ots=gF_tOKveNm&sig=t12oWaVXvVuvgrNRmGynPC5VyCA&hl=en&ei=NcCWS4T1OYiOtAPHhrXCAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Monasterium%20Fabariense&f=false p. 222]: \"from a ''fabaria'', or plantation of beans\"</ref>); the first monks came from Reichenau. The founding legend refers to the itinerant bishop [[Saint Pirmin]], with the first documentary mention of the abbey in 762.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|11595|Pf\u00e4fers (Kloster)}}</ref> The monastery controlled the important route through the [[Kunkels Pass]] to the passes into [[Italy]] in the [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. After the bishop's seat of [[Chur]] the monastery was the most important religious centre in Chur-Raetia and the [[diocese of Chur]]. Many parishes in the region were founded from Pf\u00e4fers in the 9th and 10th centuries. The substantial influence of the monastery was concentrated in eastern Switzerland, especially between [[Weesen]] and [[Maienfeld]], but reached as far as present-day [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the [[Val Bregaglia]], the [[Vinschgau]] and the [[County of Tyrol]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn 840, Emperor [[Lothair I]], king of Northern Italy and, nominally, [[Frankish Empire|Emperor of the Franks]], assured the monastery the right of freely electing its abbot. This was extended in 861 to include [[ecclesiastical immunity]] and royal protection. The [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Louis the Child]] gave Pf\u00e4fers, in 905, to [[Solomon III, Bishop of Constance]], who was also the abbot of [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St Gall]].<ref name=HDS/> Between 914 and 949, the Abbey of St. Gall and the bishop of Chur fought over the protectorship of the Abbey. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]], finally confirmed again in 949 the right of free election of the abbot to the monks themselves. During the [[Investiture Controversy]], Pf\u00e4fers again fell under foreign control, however. In 1095, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] gave the abbey to the [[diocese of Basel]], which exchanged the abbey with [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] in 1114 for the castle of [[Rappoltstein]] in [[Alsace]]; only the intervention of [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1116 restored the monastery's freedom.<ref name=HDS/> During the early Middle Ages Pf\u00e4fers remained the most important monastery in the diocese of Chur, and intellectual centre of the region. The three most important Chur-Raetian manuscripts were made in Pf\u00e4fers: ''Liber Aureus'' (the main source for the abbey's history), ''Liber viventium'' (the abbey's memorial book) and ''Vidimus Heider'' (the abbey's [[cartulary]]).\n\nIn 1208, [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], passed ''[[Vogt]]ei'' (protectorship) of the monastery to the [[Barony of Sax]], to whom the monks pledged at least partial allegiance. In 1257, Abbot Rudolf bought back their freedom for 300 silver [[mark (money)|mark]]s and, in 1261, transferred it to the {{ill|Freiherren von Wildenberg|lt=Lords of Wildenberg|de}} of [[Freudenberg Castle]]. In the 14th century there were two separate ''Vogtei'' over the monastery and the upper [[Tamina]]tal: Castle Freudenberg and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]]. Later, the protectorship passed to the counts of [[Werdenberg-Sargans]] and [[Werdenberg-Heiligenberg]]. In 1397, the monastery again bought back their ''Vogtei'' and, in 1408, [[Rupert of Germany|King Rupert]] granted the monastery the privilege to choose its own protector.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the [[county of Sargans]] as a ''[[Gemeine Herrschaft]]'' of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], the abbey became a [[Old Swiss Confederacy#Protectorates|Swiss protectorate]] in [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Sargans and the ''[[Acht Orte]]'' of the Confederacy minus Berne. The monastery was caught in the turmoil of the [[Swabian War]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the general financial and political difficulties that engulfed the region. Abbot John Heider (1586\u20131600) managed briefly to restore the original position of the monastery, but under his successors the situation worsened so the Swiss Confederacy took over administration of the monastery.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Pfaefers-Benediktinerabtei.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pf\u00e4fers Abbey and the [[Alps]].]]\n[[File:Klosterkirche pfaefers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church interior of Pf\u00e4fers Abbey.]]\nIn 1665 a fire destroyed the medieval monastery and church.<ref name=HDS/> In 1672, Abbot Justus Zink presented plans by John Serro and Giuglio Barbieri for rebuilding the abbey, in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], closer to the mountain slope, in the present dominant position, with the first rooms ready for occupation in 1674. Because of the disastrous financial situation, Abbot Zink was forced to resign in 1676, passing control to the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. His successor, Abbot Boniface I Tschupp, managed the financial recovery and completed the construction in 1694, with the new abbey church dedicated in the same year.\n\n===18th century===\nThe election of the abbot caused controversy in 1734 as [[Z\u00fcrich]] \u2014 one of the Swiss cantons in condominium over the abbey \u2014 refused to confirm the election of abbot Ambrosius M\u00fcller; Johann Jakob Scheuchzer was therefore commissioned to examine the royal privileges of the abbey. Some of the Imperial and Papal papers confirming rights of the monastery were identified as 17th-century forgeries. Negotiations at the 1738 [[Tagsatzung]] finally confirmed the rights of the abbey over the municipalities of [[Pf\u00e4fers]], [[V\u00e4ttis]], [[Valens]] and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]].\n\nIn 1794, a revolt of the monastery's subjects was crushed by the ''Vogt'' of Sargans. On 11 November 1798, during the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], the county of Sargans was released by the Confederation and Abbot Benedict Bochsler had to free his subjects in a similar manner. After the French invasion, the monastery was abolished and partially destroyed. In 1801, the abbot returned with some brothers and, in 1803, the monastery was formally restored, after the founding of the [[canton of St. Gallen]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===19th century===\nFinancial struggles prompted the last abbot of the monastery Plazidus Pfister, 1838 in Rome to request the secularization of the abbey, a request to which [[Pope Gregory XVI]] acceded in a letter dated 20 March 1838. On 20 November 1838, the Great Council of the canton of St Gallen declared that the monastery be secularised and removed its assets. The Catholic Church tried to claim the assets in vain, conceding them to St Gallen in November 1839. On 14 November 1845, in the buildings of the abbey was founded the cantonal asylum of St. Pirminsberg, today's St Pirminsberg Psychiatric Hospital. The precious artefacts from the abbey were auctioned and scattered in museums around the world. Konrad von Ritter from [[Wolfurt]] took  possession of the famous Wolfurter cup ({{lang-de|Wolfurter Kelch}}), created in the monastery in the 13th century. In 1853, the archives of the monastery were passed to Stiftsarchiv St Gallen, the archives of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]].\n\nFrom 1619 to 1845 the bones of the [[archpriest]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Rusca]] were kept in the monastery Pf\u00e4fers, who is currently nominated for [[beatification]]; today these [[relic]]s are in the Collegiate Church of [[Sondrio]] in [[Valtellina]].\n\n== Sources ==\n''This article is based on a translation of the article [[:de:Kloster Pf\u00e4fers|Kloster Pf\u00e4fers]] from the [[German Wikipedia]].

London: Rivingtons, 1898, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vqgYAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=Monasterium+Fabariense&source=bl&ots=gF_tOKveNm&sig=t12oWaVXvVuvgrNRmGynPC5VyCA&hl=en&ei=NcCWS4T1OYiOtAPHhrXCAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Monasterium%20Fabariense&f=false p. 222]: \"from a ''fabaria'', or plantation of beans\"</ref>); the first monks came from Reichenau. The founding legend refers to the itinerant bishop [[Saint Pirmin]], with the first documentary mention of the abbey in 762.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|11595|Pf\u00e4fers (Kloster)}}</ref> The monastery controlled the important route through the [[Kunkels Pass]] to the passes into [[Italy]] in the [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. After the bishop's seat of [[Chur]] the monastery was the most important religious centre in Chur-Raetia and the [[diocese of Chur]]. Many parishes in the region were founded from Pf\u00e4fers in the 9th and 10th centuries. The substantial influence of the monastery was concentrated in eastern Switzerland, especially between [[Weesen]] and [[Maienfeld]], but reached as far as present-day [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the [[Val Bregaglia]], the [[Vinschgau]] and the [[County of Tyrol]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn 840, Emperor [[Lothair I]], king of Northern Italy and, nominally, [[Frankish Empire|Emperor of the Franks]], assured the monastery the right of freely electing its abbot. This was extended in 861 to include [[ecclesiastical immunity]] and royal protection. The [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king [[Louis the Child]] gave Pf\u00e4fers, in 905, to [[Solomon III, Bishop of Constance]], who was also the abbot of [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St Gall]].<ref name=HDS/> Between 914 and 949, the Abbey of St. Gall and the bishop of Chur fought over the protectorship of the Abbey. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]], finally confirmed again in 949 the right free of free election of the abbot to the monks themselves. During the [[Investiture Controversy]], Pf\u00e4fers again fell under foreign control, however. In 1095, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] gave the abbey to the [[diocese of Basel]], which exchanged the abbey with [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] in 1114 for the castle of [[Rappoltstein]] in [[Alsace]]; only the intervention of [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1116 restored the monastery's freedom.<ref name=HDS/> During the early Middle Ages Pf\u00e4fers remained the most important monastery in the diocese of Chur, and intellectual centre of the region. The three most important Chur-Raetian manuscripts were made in Pf\u00e4fers: ''Liber Aureus'' (the main source for the abbey's history), ''Liber viventium'' (the abbey's memorial book) and ''Vidimus Heider'' (the abbey's [[cartulary]]).\n\nIn 1208, [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], passed to ''[[Vogt]]ei'' (protectorship) of the monastery to the [[Barony of Sax]], to whom the monks pledged at least partial allegiance. In 1257, Abbot Rudolf bought back their freedom for 300 silver [[mark (money)|mark]]s and, in 1261, transferred it to the {{ill|Freiherren von Wildenberg|lt=Lords of Wildenberg|de}} of [[Freudenberg Castle]]. In the 14th century there were two separate ''Vogtei'' over the monastery and the upper [[Tamina]]tal: Castle Freudenberg and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]]. Later, the protectorship passed to the counts of [[Werdenberg-Sargans]] and [[Werdenberg-Heiligenberg]]. In 1397, the monastery again bought back their ''Vogtei'' and, in 1408, [[Rupert of Germany|King Rupert]] granted the monastery the privilege to choose its own protector.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the [[county of Sargans]] as a ''[[Gemeine Herrschaft]]'' of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], the abbey became a [[Old Swiss Confederacy#Protectorates|Swiss protectorate]] in [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Sargans and the ''[[Acht Orte]]'' of the Confederacy minus Berne. The monastery was caught in the turmoil of the [[Swabian War]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the general financial and political difficulties that engulfed the region. Abbot John Heider (1586\u20131600) managed briefly to restore the original position of the monastery, but under his successors the situation worsened so the Swiss Confederacy took over administration of the monastery.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Pfaefers-Benediktinerabtei.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pf\u00e4fers Abbey and the [[Alps]].]]\n[[File:Klosterkirche pfaefers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church interior of Pf\u00e4fers Abbey.]]\nIn 1665 a fire destroyed the medieval monastery and church.<ref name=HDS/> In 1672, Abbot Justus Zink presented plans by John Serro and Giuglio Barbieri for rebuilding the abbey, in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], closer to the mountain slope, in the present dominant position, with the first rooms ready for occupation in 1674. Because of the disastrous financial situation, Abbot Zink was forced to resign in 1676, passing control to the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. His successor, Abbot Boniface I Tschupp, managed the financial recovery and completed the construction in 1694, with the new abbey church dedicated in the same year.\n\n===18th century===\nThe election of the abbot caused controversy in 1734 as [[Z\u00fcrich]] \u2014 one of the Swiss cantons in condominium over the abbey \u2014 refused to confirm the election of abbot Ambrosius M\u00fcller; Johann Jakob Scheuchzer was therefore commissioned to examine the royal privileges of the abbey. Some of the Imperial and Papal papers confirming rights of the monastery were identified as 17th-century forgeries. Negotiations at the 1738 [[Tagsatzung]] finally confirmed the rights of the abbey over the municipalities of [[Pf\u00e4fers]], [[V\u00e4ttis]], [[Valens]] and [[Bad Ragaz|Ragaz]].\n\nIn 1794, a revolt of the monastery's subjects was crushed by the ''Vogt'' of Sargans. On 11 November 1798, during the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], the county of Sargans was released by the Confederation and Abbot Benedict Bochsler had to free his subjects in a similar manner. After the French invasion, the monastery was abolished and partially destroyed. In 1801, the abbot returned with some brothers and, in 1803, the monastery was formally restored, after the founding of the [[canton of St. Gallen]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===19th century===\nFinancial struggles prompted the last abbot of the monastery Plazidus Pfister, 1838 in Rome to request the secularization of the abbey, a request to which [[Pope Gregory XVI]] acceded in a letter dated 20 March 1838. On 20 November 1838, the Great Council of the canton of St Gallen declared that the monastery be secularised and removed its assets. The Catholic Church tried to claim the assets in vain, conceding them to St Gallen in November 1839. On 14 November 1845, in the buildings of the abbey was founded the cantonal asylum of St. Pirminsberg, today's St Pirminsberg Psychiatric Hospital. The precious artefacts from the abbey were auctioned and scattered in museums around the world. Konrad von Ritter from [[Wolfurt]] took  possession of the famous Wolfurter cup ({{lang-de|Wolfurter Kelch}}), created in the monastery in the 13th century. In 1853, the archives of the monastery were passed to Stiftsarchiv St Gallen, the archives of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]].\n\nFrom 1619 to 1845 the bones of the [[archpriest]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Rusca]] were kept in the monastery Pf\u00e4fers, who is currently nominated for [[beatification]]; today these [[relic]]s are in the Collegiate Church of [[Sondrio]] in [[Valtellina]].\n\n== Sources ==\n''This article is based on a translation of the article [[:de:Kloster Pf\u00e4fers|Kloster Pf\u00e4fers]] from the [[German Wikipedia]].
