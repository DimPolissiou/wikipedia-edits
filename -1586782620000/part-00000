Zhao is the 1st surname in the famous [[Hundred Family Surnames]] \u2013 the traditional list of all Chinese surnames \u2013 because it was the emperor's surname of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) when the list was compiled. The first line of the poem is in the line \u8d99\u9322\u5b6b\u674e (Zhao, [[Qian (surname)|Qian]], [[Sun (surname)|Sun]], [[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]]).\n\nZhao may be romanized as '''[[Chiu]]''' from the [[Cantonese]] pronunciation, and is romanized in Taiwan and Hong Kong as '''[[Chao (surname)|Chao]]''' as in the [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. It is cognate with the [[Vietnamese name|Vietnamese family name]] '''[[Tri\u1ec7u]]''' and with the [[List of Korean surnames|Korean family name]] most commonly romanized as '''[[Cho (Korean surname)|Cho]]''' (\uc870).\n\nThe [[romanization]] is shared with the much rarer family name Zh\u00e0o (\u5146).\n\n==History==\nZhao is one of the most ancient of Chinese surnames, and its origins are partly shrouded in legend. During the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou]] (976/956 BC \u2013 922/918 BC), an officer named [[Zaofu]] ({{zh|c=\u9020\u7236}}) proved exceptionally adept at training horses and driving chariots and won the respect of King Mu. During a battle with the eastern [[Xu (state)|state of Xu]], an ethnically different state which was resisting Zhou rule, Zaofu drove a chariot into the battle and escorted King Mu back to the Zhou capital.  In gratitude, King Mu enfeoffed Zaofu as the lord of Zhao, a town in what is now [[Hongdong County]], [[Shanxi Province]], to be held by his descendants in perpetuity. Zaofu's descendants took Zhao as a surname to mark their prestigious association with the city. Records such as [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' say that Zaofu was a descendant of legendary kings [[Zhuanxu]], [[Shaohao]], and the [[Yellow Emperor]].\n\nThe town Zhao became part of the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] during the [[Warring States period]], when the Zhou Dynasty began to collapse.  In 403 BC, Jin split into three smaller states, one of which was the [[Zhao (state)|state of Zhao]].\n\nThe Zhao clan rulers of [[State of Qin]] and [[State of Zhao]] were highly successful, and [[State of Zhao]] were one of the last major states conquered by the [[State of Qin]] during its [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]].\n\nAs with all ancient Chinese surnames, the Zhao family was constantly added to by marriages, its bestowal upon commoners for meritorious deeds, and its adoption by non-Chinese peoples assimilated into [[Han Chinese]] culture.  The Zhao name experienced a great revival after [[Zhao Kuangyin]] became the first emperor of the Song Dynasty in 960 AD, leading to 300 years of Zhao rule over China. Notably, it is during this dynasty that the famous [[Hundred Family Surnames]] \u2013 the traditional list of all Chinese surnames \u2013 was compiled, leading the surname Zhao, that of the royal house, to be the first name listed.\n\nHowever, some cadet clans on the mainland have genealogy records preserved from the [[Cultural Revolution]] as well as some [[Hata clan]]s of [[Japan]], which could trace back to a significant amount of generations to verify the authenticity of the bloodline.\n\n==Evolution of the Zhao clan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Ahnentafel\n|1= [[Y\u00edng (Chinese surname)|Ying (Ancestral name)]] (\u5b34\u59d3) \u2013 Royal house of [[Qin (state)]]\n|2= Zhao clan (\u8d99\u6c0f) \u2013 Royal house of [[Qin Dynasty]]\n|3= The clans of [[Lian (surname)|Lian]] (\u5ec9), [[X\u00fa|Xu]] (\u5f90), [[Jiang (\u6c5f) (surname)|Jiang]] (\u6c5f), [[Qin (surname)|Qin]] (\u79e6), Zhao (\u8d99), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] (\u9ec4), [[Liang (surname)|Liang]] (\u6881), [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] (\u99ac), [[Ge (surname)|Ge]] (\u845b), [[Gu (surname)|Gu]] (\u8c37), [[Mou (surname)|Mou]] (\u7e46), [[Zhong (surname)|Zhong]] (\u937e), [[Fei (surname)|Fei]] (\u8cbb), and [[Qu (surname)|Qu]] (\u77bf)\n|4= Zhao Clan (\u8d99\u6c0f) \u2013 China, Royal house of [[Song Dynasty]]\n}}\n\n== Modern culture ==\nIn [[Lu Xun]]'s novel ''[[The True Story of Ah Q]],'' Ah Q said he belonged to the same clan as Mr. Zhao, who was an honored landlord of the village.

Zhao is the 1st surname in the famous [[Hundred Family Surnames]] \u2013 the traditional list of all Chinese surnames \u2013 because it was the emperor's surname of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) when the list was compiled. The first line of the poem is in the line \u8d99\u9322\u5b6b\u674e (Zhao, [[Qian (surname)|Qian]], [[Sun (surname)|Sun]], [[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]]).\n\nZhao may be romanized as '''[[Chiu]]''' from the [[Cantonese]] pronunciation, and is romanized in Taiwan and Hong Kong as '''[[Chao (surname)|Chao]]''' as in the [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. It is cognate with the [[Vietnamese name|Vietnamese family name]] '''[[Tri\u1ec7u]]''' and with the [[List of Korean surnames|Korean family name]] most commonly romanized as '''[[Cho (Korean surname)|Cho]]''' (\uc870).\n\nThe [[romanization]] is shared with the much rarer family name Zh\u00e0o (\u5146).\n\n==History==\nZhao is one of the most ancient of Chinese surnames, and its origins are partly shrouded in legend. During the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou]] (976/956 BC \u2013 922/918 BC), an officer named [[Zaofu]] ({{zh|c=\u9020\u7236}}) proved exceptionally adept at training horses and driving chariots and won the respect of King Mu. During a battle with the eastern [[Xu (state)|state of Xu]], an ethnically different state which was resisting Zhou rule, Zaofu drove a chariot into the battle and escorted King Mu back to the Zhou capital.  In gratitude, King Mu enfeoffed Zaofu as the lord of Zhao, a town in what is now [[Hongdong County]], [[Shanxi Province]], to be held by his descendants in perpetuity. Zaofu's descendants took Zhao as a surname to mark their prestigious association with the city. Records such as [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' say that Zaofu was a descendant of legendary kings [[Zhuanxu]], [[Shaohao]], and the [[Yellow Emperor]].\n\nThe town Zhao became part of the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] during the [[Warring States period]], when the Zhou Dynasty began to collapse.  In 403 BC, Jin split into three smaller states, one of which was the [[Zhao (state)|state of Zhao]].\n\nThe Zhao clan rulers of [[State of Qin]] and [[State of Zhao]] were highly successful, and [[State of Zhao]] were one of the last major states conquered by the [[State of Qin]] during its [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]].\n\nAs with all ancient Chinese surnames, the Zhao family was constantly added to by marriages, its bestowal upon commoners for meritorious deeds, and its adoption by non-Chinese peoples assimilated into [[Han Chinese]] culture.  The Zhao name experienced a great revival after [[Zhao Kuangyin]] became the first emperor of the Song Dynasty in 960 AD, leading to 300 years of Zhao rule over China. Notably, it is during this dynasty that the famous [[Hundred Family Surnames]] \u2013 the traditional list of all Chinese surnames \u2013 was compiled, leading the surname Zhao, that of the royal house, to be the first name listed.\n\nHowever, some cadet clans on the mainland have genealogy records preserved from the [[Cultural Revolution]] as well as some [[Hata clan]]s of [[Japan]], which could trace back to a significant amount of generations to verify the authenticity of the bloodline.\n\n==Evolution of the Zhao clan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Ahnentafel\n|1= [[Y\u00edng (Chinese surname)|Ying (Ancestral name)]] (\u5b34\u59d3) \u2013 Royal house of [[Qin (state)]]\n|2= Zhao clan (\u8d99\u6c0f) \u2013 Royal house of [[Qin Dynasty]]\n|3= The clans of [[Lian (surname)|Lian]] (\u5ec9), [[X\u00fa|Xu]] (\u5f90), [[Jiang (\u6c5f) (surname)|Jiang]] (\u6c5f), [[Qin (surname)|Qin]] (\u79e6), Zhao (\u8d99), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] (\u9ec4), [[Liang (surname)|Liang]] (\u6881), [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] (\u99ac), [[Ge (surname)|Ge]] (\u845b), [[Gu (surname)|Gu]] (\u8c37), [[Mou (surname)|Mou]] (\u7e46), [[Zhong (surname)|Zhong]] (\u937e), [[Fei (surname)|Fei]] (\u8cbb), and [[Qu (surname)|Qu]] (\u77bf)\n|4= Zhao Clan (\u8d99\u6c0f) \u2013 China, Royal house of [[Song Dynasty]]\n}}\n\n== Modern Culture ==\nIn [[Lu Xun]]'s novel ''[[The True Story of Ah Q]],'' Ah Q said he belonged to the same clan as Mr. Zhao, who was an honored landlord of the village.

It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], who also directs the film, reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. It co-stars [[Diana Scarwid]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Roberta Maxwell]]. The screenplay is written by [[Charles Edward Pogue]]. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by [[Carter Burwell]] in one of his earliest projects. ''Psycho III'' is unrelated to [[Robert Bloch]]'s third ''Psycho'' novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', which was released in 1990.\n\nThe film takes place one month after the events of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree.\n\nReleased on July 2, 1986, ''Psycho III'' grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on an $8.4 million budget, becoming a financial failure and the lowest-grossing film in the series, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a television sequel, ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982, [[Norman Bates]] works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of [[Emma Spool]], whom he erroneously believes to be his mother. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, are concerned because Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant motel manager to replace the late Warren Toomey who was fired by Norman. Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released. She believes that Norman is killing again, so when Norman appears at the diner, Tracy attempts to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives, Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. He is startled because she resembles his former victim, [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.\n\n\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom later that night, intending to kill her, only to find that Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. Later that night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than just a fling, Duane throws her out. Red tries to call a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, where they plan to watch a local [[American football|football]] game. Meanwhile, Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.\n\nPatsy Boyle, the only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman discovers Patsy's body and buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane demands a large sum of money to keep quiet or else he will turn Norman over to the police. They fight and Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane then regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Meanwhile, Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also been institutionalized for murder.\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. Norman and Maureen share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. She tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Mrs. Spool kidnapped Norman when he was a child, after killing Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Mrs. Spool's corpse.

It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], who also directs the film, reprising the role of [[Norman Bates]]. It co-stars [[Diana Scarwid]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Roberta Maxwell]]. The screenplay is written by [[Charles Edward Pogue]]. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by [[Carter Burwell]] in one of his earliest projects. ''Psycho III'' is unrelated to [[Robert Bloch]]'s third ''Psycho'' novel, ''[[Psycho House]]'', which was released in 1990.\n\nThe film takes place one month after the events of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree.\n\nReleased on July 2, 1986, ''Psycho III'' grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on an $8.4 million budget, becoming a financial failure and the lowest-grossing film in the series, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a television sequel, ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982, [[Norman Bates]] works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of [[Emma Spool]], whom he erroneously believes to be his mother. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, are concerned because Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant motel manager to replace the late Warren Toomey who was fired by Norman. Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released. She believes that Norman is killing again, so when Norman appears at the diner, Tracy attempts to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives, Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. He is startled because she resembles his former victim, [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.\n\n\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom later that night, intending to kill her, only to find that Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. Later that night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than just a fling, Duane throws her out. Red tries to call a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, where they plan to watch a local [[American football|football]] game. Meanwhile, Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.\n\nPatsy Boyle, the only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman discovers Patsy's body and buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane demands a large sum of money to keep quiet or else he will turn Norman over to the police. They fight and Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane then regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Meanwhile, Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also been institutionalized for murder.\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. Norman and Maureen share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. She tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Mrs. Spool kidnapped Norman when he was a child, after killing Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Mrs. Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that they may never release him from the institution again. Norman replies: \"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free.\" In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses a trophy he concealed: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He strokes the hand and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Maureen Coyle\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Duane Duke\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Tracy Venable\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* Gary Bayer as Father Brian\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* [[Donovan Scott]] as Kyle\n* [[Karen Hensel]] as Sister Catherine\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Lou\n* [[Katt Shea]] as Patsy Boyle\n* [[Juliette Cummins]] as Red\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]] (flashback)\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]] (flashback)\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Psycho III:<br />Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1986\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 30:39\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   = [[Carter Burwell]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Psycho III\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = Scream of Love\n | single1date = July 1986\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side one\n| all_writing     = Carter Burwell, except where noted<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Carter-Burwell-Psycho-III-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/release/3752611|title=Carter Burwell - Psycho III (Music From The Motion Picture)|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n| title1          = Scream of Love (Theme Song From the Motion Picture ''Psycho III'')\n| writer1         = Carter Burwell/David Sanborn/Steve Bray\n| length1         = 3:47\n| title2          = Maureen in the Desert\n| length2         = 1:56\n| title3          = Dirty Street\n| writer3         = Carter Burwell/Stanton-Miranda/Steve Bray\n| length3         = 3:37\n| title4          = Before and After Shower\n| length4         = 3:36\n| title5          = Warm as a Cry for Help\n| length5         = 2:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title6          = Sisters/Catherine Mary\n| writer6         = Carter Burwell/Stanton-Miranda/Steve Bray\n| length6         = 4:13\n| title7          = Mother?\n| length7         = 2:45\n| title8          = Bad Boys and Body Bags\n| length8         = 3:53\n| title9          = Revenge of a Thankless Child\n| length9         = 2:47\n| title10         = Electroshock Waiting Room\n| length10        = 1:45\n}}\n\n[[Carter Burwell]] was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on ''[[Blood Simple]]''.

Since the Netherlands did [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] the [[Moscow]] Olympic Games Bakker represented his National Olympic Committee at the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Soling|1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tallinn]], [[USSR]] under the Dutch [[National Olympic Committee|NOC]] flag. With his father [[Geert Bakker]] as helmsman and fellow crew member [[Dick Coster]], Bakker took the 5th place in the [[Soling]]. In the [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Star|1988 Olympics]] in [[Busan|Pusan]] Bakker made his second Olympic appearance. This time as helmsman in the Dutch [[Star (sailboat)|Star]] with [[Kobus Vandenberg]] as crew. They took 9th place.\n\nSteven Bakker also represented The Netherlands during the [[2008 Vintage Yachting Games]] in [[Medemblik]] as helmsman in the [[Soling]] with crewmembers [[Sven Coster|Sven/]] [[Dick Coster]] and [[Joost Houweling]]. The team took silver. At the [[2012 Vintage Yachting Games]] at [[Lake Como]] Bakker helmed again the Soling now with crewmembers [[Robin Segaar]] and [[Casper van Drunen]]. The team finished 11th in the series.\n\n==Controversy==\nSeveral countries did [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]], others like France did not go since they found the competition devaluated. As result only half of the expected fleet was present during the Olympic regattas.\n\n==Professional life==\nBakker held several positions in the construction and real estate business.

The canal link was never constructed.\n\n==History==\n\nThe [[Lancaster Canal]] Company obtained an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[Westmoreland Canals Act 1792|32 Geo. III c. 101]]) in 1792 to construct a canal linking the towns of [[Kendal]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] to the coalfields around [[Wigan]].  [[Coal]] was to be the chief traffic northwards and [[limestone]] southwards.{{efn|In the original Canal documentation (see Barritt; 2000), the southbound and northbound tracks were referred to as the ''Limestone'' and ''Coal Roads'' respectively &ndash; reflecting their primary traffic and its direction}} Most of the canal was completed quickly, including the impressive [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] across the [[River Lune]] near Lancaster, but the part across the wide valley of the River Ribble remained to be built when the construction [[Capital (economics)|capital]] became exhausted.\n\nThe original plan foresaw an impressive stone aqueduct across the river and up to 32 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] to complete the route.  As a temporary measure, the canal company constructed a [[Tramway (industrial)|tramroad]] to link the two halves and allow revenue traffic to start flowing.  Construction took three years.\n\n==The tramroad==\n\nIn 1794, the canal company engaged the services of [[William Cartwright engineer|William Cartwright]], first to supervise the construction of the foundations for the Lune Aqueduct and later as Resident [[Engineer]]. [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]] and [[William Jessop]] were the chief engineers to the company, but such was the demand for their services at this time of [[Canal Mania]] that they were much in demand elsewhere and Cartwright was solely responsible for the construction of the tramroad.  His house in Preston is still extant and now forms the fa\u00e7ade of a new shopping arcade.\n\nThe five-mile-long tramroad comprised a double-track [[plateway]], except for a short section of single track through a tunnel under Fishergate in Preston, just south of the canal basin.  The iron rails were \u2018L\u2019 shaped in section and were spiked to large limestone blocks.  The wheels on the wagons were not [[flange]]d and it was the vertical section on the iron rails that kept the wheels on the track.  The gauge was 4 foot 3&nbsp;inches (1295&nbsp;mm) between the verticals, which were on the inside of the track.\n\nThe wagons were pulled by [[horse]]s, up to six at a time, and each wagon had a capacity of two [[long ton|tons]].  Originally there were three [[inclined plane]]s where the wagons were hauled via stationary [[steam engine]]s  and a continuous [[chain]].\n\n[[File:Old Tram Bridge, Preston 232-01.jpg|thumb|The 1960s replica bridge across the Ribble]]\nThe tramroad crossed the River Ribble on a timber [[trestle bridge]].  This structure outlived the tramroad by nearly one hundred years and was replaced by a [[precast concrete]] structure to the same design in the 1960s.<ref>(Engineering Timelines, 2007)</ref>\n\nThere were many accidents during the life of the tramroad, many involving the inclined planes with wagons running away.\n\nAs was common on early \u2018railway\u2019 systems, the wagons could be privately owned by the hauliers themselves (known locally as halers) who paid the company a toll to use the tramroad.  The last haler to work the tramroad, John Procter, walked the 10-mile return journey twice a day for 32 years.  It has been estimated <ref>(Barritt, 2000)</ref> that he walked or rode nearly {{convert|200000|mi|km|sigfig=1}} during his career on the tramroad, and needed his [[clogs]] resoling once per week.\n\n==Decline and closure==\n\nIn 1813, estimates were prepared to replace the tramroad by a canal but the cost of \u00a3160,000 was too much for the company at the time.  In 1831 the coming of the [[Preston and Wigan Railway]] sounded the death knell for the tramroad and proposals were made to convert it into a [[railway]] or amalgamate with the new railway company.  This never happened and the tramroad became embroiled in the railway politics of the day.<ref>(Barritt, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn 1837 the new [[Bolton and Preston Railway]] leased the tramroad as a potential alternative route into Preston that avoided the rival [[North Union Railway]]. However, an agreement was concluded between the two parties before this proved necessary.  Nevertheless, the lease arrangements were incorporated into the Bolton and Preston Railway\u2019s Act of Parliament and the ownership of the tramroad passed to the railway.  In 1844 the Bolton and Preston merged with the rival North Union Railway and shortly afterwards a branch line to the canal basin in Preston was built.  This created a railhead for Wigan coal in Preston and removed the ''raison d\u2019\u00eatre'' of the tramroad.\n\n[[File:Walton summit remains.jpg|thumb|right|All that remains of the terminus of the South branch of the Lancaster canal]]\nAlthough the North Union wanted to close the tramroad immediately the canal company objected and they were forced to maintain it in an increasingly decrepit state until the Lancaster Canal Transfer Act of 1864 provided for the canal north of Preston to be leased in perpetuity to the railway and that south of Walton Summit to be leased to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]].  The Act also allowed closure of the tramroad between Preston and [[Bamber Bridge]].\n\nIn 1872, a land exchange between Preston Corporation and the railway saw the formation between Preston and Carr Wood pass into municipal ownership.  This part, including the tramroad bridge over the River Ribble, was turned into a footpath, which remains to the present day.\n\nA further Act in 1879 enabled the last part of the tramroad between Bamber Bridge and Walton Summit, to be closed.  The north end of the canal was eventually sold to the [[London & North Western Railway]] and the Lancaster Canal Company was wound up at the beginning of 1886.<ref>(Barritt, 2000)</ref>\n\n==Preserved remains==\n\n[[File:Fishergate Tramroad Tunnel, Preston - geograph.org.uk - 952735.jpg|thumb|right|The tunnel under Fishergate is now used to access a car park]]\n[[File:Tramway bridge, Garden St, Preston 231-17.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the bridge over Garden Street in Preston]]\n\nA well-preserved section of track from the south side of the McKenzie Inn on Station Road in Bamber Bridge was taken up and relaid in [[Worden Park]] in [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]. Plates and stone sleepers are in South Ribble Museum in Leyland and the [[Harris Museum]] in Preston. The Harris Museum also has a model of a wagon and a wheel and axle of a wagon recovered from the bed of the River Ribble (Clegg ''et al.'', 2001).  They had lain there since an accident involving the failure of the endless chain on the Avenham Incline, which caused a train of wagons to run away and plunge into the river at the bottom.\n\nA later (>1885?) enlargement of the tunnel under Fishergate (Moss, 1968) continues in use for vehicle access to the [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]] car park - it formerly accessed the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]'s Butler Street goods yard (Biddle, 1989). Part of a support for a bridge over Garden Street remains. A path on the northern edge of [[Avenham Park]] follows the route of the tramway, down the Avenham Incline and across a footbridge over the [[River Ribble]] on the site of the original trestle bridge. The footpath continues along the flood plain embankment to the [[Penwortham]] Incline.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Barritt, S.

Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus of Jews from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community of Jews forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]].

Cleopatra hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the [[Roman Republic]], as well as of Egypt. After [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassination]] on 15 March 44&nbsp;BC, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt. Caesarion was named co-ruler by his mother on 2 September 44&nbsp;BC at the age of three, although he was pharaoh in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority. Cleopatra compared her relationship to her son with that of the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] and her divine child [[Horus]].<ref name=\"roller\" />\n\nThere is no historical record of Caesarion between 44&nbsp;BC until the Donations of Antioch in 36&nbsp;BC. Two years later he also appears at the [[Donations of Alexandria]]. Cleopatra and Antony staged both \"Donations\" to donate lands dominated by [[Rome]] and [[Parthia]] to Cleopatra's children: Caesarion, the twins [[Alexander Helios]] and [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] (the latter were his three maternal half-siblings fathered by [[Mark Antony]]).

Caesarion was proclaimed to be [[Deification|a god]], [[Divi filius|a son of [a] god]], and \"[[King of Kings]]\". This grandiose title was \"unprecedented in the management of Roman client-king relationships\" and could be seen as \"threatening the 'greatness' of the Roman people\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Meyer Reinhold |title=Studies in Classical History and Society |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=US |year=2002 |page=58}}</ref> Antony also declared Caesarion to be Caesar's true son and heir. This declaration was a direct threat to Octavian (whose claim to power was based on his status as Julius Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son).

Cleopatra may have sent Caesarion, 17&nbsp;years old at the time, to the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Berenice (port)|Berenice]] for safety, possibly as part of plans for an escape to [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]]; he may have been sent years earlier, but the sources are unclear. [[Plutarch]] does say that Caesarion was sent to India, but also that he was lured back by false promises of the kingdom of Egypt: <blockquote>Caesarion, who was said to be Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar, was sent by his mother, with much treasure, into India, by way of Ethiopia.
