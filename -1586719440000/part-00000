She has smooth, white skin and is centered against a landscape background.]]\n\n'''Oil painting''' is the process of [[painting]] with [[pigments]] with a medium of [[drying oil]] as the [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Commonly used drying oils include [[linseed oil]], [[poppy seed oil]], [[walnut oil]], and [[safflower oil]]. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the [[oil paint]], such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a [[resin]], such as pine resin or [[frankincense]], to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\n\nAlthough oil paint was first used for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] paintings by painters in central and western [[Afghanistan]] sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Earliest Oil Paintings Found in Famed Afghan Caves|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080205-afghan-paintings_2.html|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in Northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\nIn recent years, [[water miscible oil paint]] has become available. Water-soluble paints are either engineered or an [[emulsifier]] has been added that allows them to be thinned with water rather than [[paint thinner]], and allows, when sufficiently diluted, very fast drying times (1\u20133 days) when compared with traditional oils (1\u20133 weeks).\n\n==Techniques==\n[[Image:Sj\u00e4lvportr\u00e4tt av Anders Zorn 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|''Self-portrait, at work'', [[Anders Zorn]], ''1897''|alt=Painting shows a man in the foreground with a loose-fitting white outfit and a mustache holding a wooden palette with his paints. A pair of feminine legs are visible upper right.]]\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. [[Oil paint]] is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade [[mineral spirits]], or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is '[[fat over lean]]', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. \n\nThere are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint. \n\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using [[paintbrush]]es, but there are other methods, including using [[palette knife|palette knives]] and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some [[turpentine]] for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped.

However, [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, ''On Various Arts'', written in 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. However, [[early Netherlandish painting]] with artists like Van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.\n\nEarly works were still [[panel painting]]s on wood, but around the end of the 15th century [[canvas]] became more popular as the support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of [[gesso]] (a fine type of plaster). [[Venice]], where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small [[cabinet painting]]s were also made on metal, especially copper plates.  These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from [[printmaking]] were reused for this purpose. The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based [[fresco]] for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Flax seeds.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flax#Flax seeds|Flax seed]] is the source of linseed oil.|alt=A close-up of glistening, golden flax seeds.]]\n\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the [[flax]] seed, a common fiber crop.

[[Safflower]] oil or the [[walnut]] or [[poppyseed oil]] are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \"yellow\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film.

The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \"stretcher\" or \"strainer\". The difference between the two names is that ''stretchers'' are slightly adjustable, while ''strainers'' are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \"[[sizing|size]]\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of [[animal glue]] (modern painters will use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a ''gesso'', a mixture of glue and chalk.\n\nModern acrylic \"[[gesso]]\" is made of [[titanium dioxide]] with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \"sandable\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white.  The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible in the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\n\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century.

Size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate \"runs\" for figures (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage'') and marines (''marine'') that more or less preserve the diagonal.

Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Oil painting palette.jpg|thumb|A traditional wood [[Palette (painting)|palette]] used to hold and mix small amounts of paint while working.|alt=A man's finger sticks through a hole in a large wooden palette. One of his hands is dipping a brush into the paint and the other holds numerous brushes in reserve.]]\nOil paint is made by mixing [[pigment]]s of colors with an oil medium.  Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An [[artist's palette]], traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as [[sulphide]]s for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\n\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and [[List of artistic media#Painting|medium]]. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the [[studio]]. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter [[John Goffe Rand]]'s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of [[Claude Monet]]'s birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient [[plein air]] painting (a common approach in French [[Impressionism]]).\n\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and [[mongoose]] hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red [[sable]] brushes ([[weasel]] hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"[[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|kolinsky sable]]\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the [[Siberian weasel]]. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap.\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as [[squirrel]] hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\n\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as [[cost efficient]].\n \nBrushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The ''type'' of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]]. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\n\n==Examples of famous works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', [[Jan van Eyck]], ''1434'' (on panel)\nImage:La donna velata v2.jpg|''[[La velata|La donna velata]]'', [[Raphael]], ''1516''\nImage:Tizian_085.jpg|''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', [[Titian]], ''1562''\nImage:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''1610\u201311''\nImage:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg| ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', [[Rembrandt]], ''1632''\nImage:Innocent-x-velazquez.jpg| ''[[Portrait of Innocent X|Innocent X]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''c 1650''\nImage:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'', [[Johannes Vermeer]], ''1658\u20131660''\nImage:The_Toilet_of_Venus,_by_Fran\u00e7ois_Boucher.jpg| ''The Toilet of Venus'', [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''1751''\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg| ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', Thomas Gainsborough, ''1770''\nImage:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|''[[Battle of Somosierra]]'', [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]], 1837\nImage:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', [[Claude Monet]], ''1875''\nImage:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg| ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] ''1876''\nImage:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''1890''\nImage:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|''[[The Card Players]]'', [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''1892''\nImage:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1903\nImage:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1907\nImage:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|''Composition VII'', [[Wassily Kandinsky]], ''1913''\nImage:Chagall Bella.jpg| ''[[Bella with White Collar]]'', [[Marc Chagall]], ''1917''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikibooks|Introduction to Art}}\n{{commons category|Oil paintings}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Britannica|426194|Oil painting}}\n* Chieffo, Clifford T.:Contemporary Oil Painter's Handbook, Prentice Hall, 1976\n* Borchert, Till-Holger.

Commonly used drying oils include [[linseed oil]], [[poppy seed oil]], [[walnut oil]], and [[safflower oil]]. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the [[oil paint]], such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a [[resin]], such as pine resin or [[frankincense]], to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\n\nAlthough oil paint was first used for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] paintings by painters in central and western [[Afghanistan]] sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Earliest Oil Paintings Found in Famed Afghan Caves|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080205-afghan-paintings_2.html|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in Northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\nIn recent years, [[water miscible oil paint]] has become available. Water-soluble paints are either engineered or an [[emulsifier]] has been added that allows them to be thinned with water rather than [[paint thinner]], and allows, when sufficiently diluted, very fast drying times (1\u20133 days) when compared with traditional oils (1\u20133 weeks).\n\n==Techniques==\n[[Image:Sj\u00e4lvportr\u00e4tt av Anders Zorn 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|''Self-portrait, at work'', [[Anders Zorn]], ''1897''|alt=Painting shows a man in the foreground with a loose-fitting white outfit and a mustache holding a wooden palette with his paints. A pair of feminine legs are visible upper right.]]\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. [[Oil paint]] is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade [[mineral spirits]], or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is '[[fat over lean]]', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. \n\nThere are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint. \n\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using [[paintbrush]]es, but there are other methods, including using [[palette knife|palette knives]] and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some [[turpentine]] for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped. Oil paint dries by [[oxidation]], not [[evaporation]], and is usually dry to the touch within a span of two weeks (some colors dry within days). It is generally dry enough to be [[varnish]]ed in six months to a year. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Selfportrait (Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn) - Nationalmuseum - 22374.tif|thumb|upright|Self-portrait of [[Rembrandt]], 1630.

For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]]. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\n\n==Examples of famous works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', [[Jan van Eyck]], ''1434'' (on panel)\nImage:La donna velata v2.jpg|''[[La velata|La donna velata]]'', [[Raphael]], ''1516''\nImage:Tizian_085.jpg|''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', [[Titian]], ''1562''\nImage:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''1610\u201311''\nImage:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg| ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', [[Rembrandt]], ''1632''\nImage:Innocent-x-velazquez.jpg| ''[[Portrait of Innocent X|Innocent X]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''c 1650''\nImage:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'', [[Johannes Vermeer]], ''1658\u20131660''\nImage:The_Toilet_of_Venus,_by_Fran\u00e7ois_Boucher.jpg| ''The Toilet of Venus'', [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''1751''\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg| ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', Thomas Gainsborough, ''1770''\nImage:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|''[[Battle of Somosierra]]'', [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]], 1837\nImage:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', [[Claude Monet]], ''1875''\nImage:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg| ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] ''1876''\nImage:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''1890''\nImage:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|''[[The Card Players]]'', [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''1892''\nImage:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1903\nImage:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1907\nImage:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|''Composition VII'', [[Wassily Kandinsky]], ''1913''\nImage:Chagall Bella.jpg| ''[[Bella with White Collar]]'', [[Marc Chagall]], ''1917''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikibooks|Introduction to Art}}\n{{commons category|Oil paintings}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Britannica|426194|Oil painting}}\n* Chieffo, Clifford T.:Contemporary Oil Painter's Handbook, Prentice Hall, 1976\n* Borchert, Till-Holger.

Ernst Heinrich, who was only six at the time, was possibly the child who felt this loss most.\n\n=== World War I ===\n[[File:PrinceErnstHeinrich.jpg|right|thumb|Prince Ernst Heinrich in 1906]]\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, Ernest Heinrich was [[first lieutenant]] in the 1st Royal Saxon Leib-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 100.  In September 1914, he became [[Batman (military)|batman]] in the General Kommando of [[XIX (2nd Royal Saxon) Corps]] at [[Reims]] and [[Lille]]. He did his ''[[Abitur]]'' during a four-month leave in 1916, then took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]] as a member of the staff of the 24th Reserve Division. On 30 August 1916, Ernst Heinrich received the [[Military Order of St. Henry]] for merit.\n\nIn the spring of 1917, he took over the leadership of the 9th Company of Reserve-Infantry Regiment No. 104 in [[Berezhany]] (in eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]). He was in the hospital for two months in 1917, after which he commanded the 9th Battery of Artillery Regiment No. 115 in the area around [[Ypres]].\n\nBeginning in May 1918, he led the 1st Squadron of Mounted Guard Regiments in Stary Bychow at Dnieper in Russia and, in August of the same year, he was in charge of the Saxon troops in [[Dorpat]], [[Tallinn|Reval]] and Finland. In November and December 1918, Ernst Heinrich oversaw the return of Saxon troops to Germany.\n\n=== 1920s ===\nIn 1919 and 1920, Ernst Heinrich learned to administer a manor in [[Silesia]]. During the [[Kapp Putsch]] in March 1920, he acted as a liaison between the putschists in [[Berlin]] and the [[Reichswehr]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. After the failure of the putsch, he moved to [[Munich]], where he joined the circle around the former Crown Prince [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Rupprecht]] of Bavaria.  He married on 12 April 1921 in the [[Nymphenburg Palace]] to [[Princess Sophie of Luxembourg|Sophie]] (14 February 1902 &ndash; 24 May 1941), the youngest sister of [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]] and of Rupprecht's wife [[Princess Antonia of Luxembourg]]. This was considered a happy marriage; they had three sons.\n\nErnst Heinrich did not participate in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] on 8 and 9 November 1923 in Munich.  He rejected the [[Nazi]] ideology consistently and distanced himself from Hitler and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]]. At his father's request, he took over the function of head of the administration of the association ''House of Wettin &mdash; Albertinische Linie e.V.'' His father also gave him power of attorney to negotiate with the Free State of Saxony about the future use of the manors owned by the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] family and their art collection. On 25 June 1925, a treaty was signed between the Free State and its former ruling dynasty, regulating the relation between the House of Wettin and the Free State, within the context of the law on the subject of 9 July 1924.\n\nIn subsequent years, Ernst Heinrich, who was an avid art lover, made several trips to [[Egypt]] with his wife and children. In 1928/29, he was approached by [[Gustav Stresemann]] of the DVP (the German People's Party), who wanted Ernst Heinrich to stand as a candidate for the federal presidency. Ernst Heinrich considered this a hopeless undertaking and declined.\n\n=== Nazi era ===\nErnst Heinrich opposed the Nazis after they formed a government on 30 January 1933. However, he failed to read the political situation correctly. He believed that Hitler could be stopped by the conservative political opposition and, in the spring of 1933, he joined ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'', hoping he could escape the influence of the Nazis. On 1 July 1934, during the [[Night of the Long Knives]], he was arrested. He was interned in the concentration camp in [[Hohnstein]] for five days.\n\nAfter his release, Ernst Heinrich retired to [[Moritzburg Castle]] in Saxony. He was an avid hunter and had to keep in touch with Nazi leaders such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], who, as Master of the Hunt, was interested in the forests owned by the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]]s, and [[Martin Mutschmann]], the Nazi governor of Saxony.  In 1938, he received King [[Carol II of Romania]] in his castle, and in 1939 he had extensive political discussions with [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]], who had been mayor of Leipzig and was later active in the [[German Resistance to Nazism|German resistance]]. A few weeks before the outbreak of [[World War II]], Ernst Heinrich was drafted into the [[Abwehr]] group IV in Dresden.\n\nIn 1943, he openly expressed doubts that the death of his brother [[Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony]] had been an accident. The [[Gestapo]] then arrested and questioned him. However, there were no further personal consequences, as the Nazis were still reluctant to confront a member of a former royal family.\n\nErnst Heinrich was an admirer of the art of [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]]. After she lost her home when Berlin was bombed in 1943, he invited her to move to Moritzburg, where she lived and worked at the ''Rudenhof'' in the immediate vicinity of the castle, until she died in April 1945.\n\nIn February 1945, nearby [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden was bombed]]. In March 1945, Ernst Heinrich fled to [[Sigmaringen]] to escape the advancing [[Red Army]]. Before he left, Ernst Heinrich and his sons buried most of their valuables in 40 crates in the K\u00f6nigswald forest. Most of this treasure was found by the Red Army and carried off to the Soviet Union. However, three crates full of treasure were rediscovered in 1995.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== After the war ===\nIn 1947, Ernst Heinrich married the actress Virginia Dulon (1910\u20132002), who styled herself ''Princess Virginia of Saxony'' after her marriage. Later that year, he purchased the Coolamber estate in [[Lismacaffrey]] ([[County Westmeath]]) in Ireland and moved there with his second wife and his sons from his first marriage. \n\nHe died in [[Edingen-Neckarhausen|Neckarhausen]] while visiting Germany in 1971.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nErnst Heinrich was first married<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> to [[Princess Sophie of Luxembourg]],<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> sixth and youngest daughter<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> of [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] and his wife [[Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal]],<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> on 12 April 1921 at [[Schloss Hohenburg]].<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> Ernst Heinrich and Sophie had three sons:<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>\n\n*'''Prince Albrecht Friedrich August Johannes Gregor ''Dedo'' of Saxony''' (born 9 May 1922 in [[Munich]];<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> died 6 December 2009 in [[Radebeul]], Germany).<ref>[http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/dresden/aktuell/2009/12/07/wettiner-prinz-dedo/ist-tot.html Wettiner prinz Dedo ist tot]</ref><ref>http://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2009/12/death-of-prince-dedo-of-saxony.html</ref>  Never married or had issue.\n*'''Prince Georg ''Timo'' Michael Nikolaus Maria of Saxony''' (born 22 December 1923 in [[Munich]]; died 22 April 1982 in [[Emden]]).<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  He married three times:  \n**first to Margrit Lucas (1923-1957) on 7 August 1952, by whom he had two children, [[Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony|R\u00fcdiger Karl Ernst Timo Aldi]] (born 23 December 1953, head of house since 2012) and Iris Hildegard Sophie Margit Gisela (born 21 September 1955); \n**second from 1966-1973 to Charlotte Schwindack (born 1919), from whom he was divorced; \n**and third to Erina Eilts (1921-2010) in 1974. \n**Before his marriages, he also had a son by Erika Montanus, Hubertus von Sachsen, (born 25 May 1950).<ref>http://thepeerage.com/p11107.htm#i111068</ref>\n*'''Prince Rupprecht Hubertus ''Gero'' Maria of Saxony''' (born 12 September 1925 in [[Munich]]; died 10 April 2003 in [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]])<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  Never married or had issue.\n\nSophie died on 24 May 1941 in [[Munich]] of pneumonia.<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/><ref>Cause of death: \"Geschichte des Hauses Wettin von seinen Anfaengen bis zur Gegenwart\" (\"History of the House of Wettin From Its Origins To the Present\") at http://www.prinz-albert-von-sachsen.de/inhalt/historie/hist_haus_wettin.htm</ref> Following her death, Ernst Heinrich married [[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]] Virginia Dulon (1910-2002) on 28 June 1947 in [[Paris]].<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  This marriage was without issue.<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>\n\n==Titles, styles and honours==\n===Titles and styles===\n*'''9 December 1896 \u2013 14 June 1971''': ''His Royal Highness'' Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony, Duke of Saxony\n\n===Honours===\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Prussia}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]]<ref name=\"p108\">Justus Perthes, ''Almanach de Gotha 1923'' (1923) [https://archive.org/details/almanachdegotha00unse_94/page/108 pp. 108-109]</ref>\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Saxony}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Rue Crown]]<ref name=\"p108\"/>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He was an avid hunter and had to keep in touch with Nazi leaders such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], who, as Master of the Hunt, was interested in the forests owned by the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]]s, and [[Martin Mutschmann]], the Nazi governor of Saxony.  In 1938, he received King [[Carol II of Romania]] in his castle, and in 1939 he had extensive political discussions with [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]], who had been mayor of Leipzig and was later active in the [[German Resistance to Nazism|German resistance]]. A few weeks before the outbreak of [[World War II]], Ernst Heinrich was drafted into the [[Abwehr]] group IV in Dresden.\n\nIn 1943, he openly expressed doubts that the death of his brother [[Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony]] had been an accident. The [[Gestapo]] then arrested and questioned him. However, there were no further personal consequences, as the Nazis were still reluctant to confront a member of a former royal family.\n\nErnst Heinrich was an admirer of the art of [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]]. After she lost her home when Berlin was bombed in 1943, he invited her to move to Moritzburg, where she lived and worked at the ''Rudenhof'' in the immediate vicinity of the castle, until she died in April 1945.\n\nIn February 1945, nearby [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden was bombed]]. In March 1945, Ernst Heinrich fled to [[Sigmaringen]] to escape the advancing [[Red Army]]. Before he left, Ernst Heinrich and his sons buried most of their valuables in 40 crates in the K\u00f6nigswald forest. Most of this treasure was found by the Red Army and carried off to the Soviet Union. However, three crates full of treasure were rediscovered in 1995.{{fact|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== After the war ===\nIn 1947, Ernst Heinrich married the actress Virginia Dulon (1910\u20132002), who styled herself ''Princess Virginia of Saxony'' after her marriage. Later that year, he purchased the Coolamber estate in [[Lismacaffrey]] ([[County Westmeath]]) in Ireland and moved there with his second wife and his sons from his first marriage. \n\nHe died in [[Edingen-Neckarhausen|Neckarhausen]] while visiting Germany in 1971.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nErnst Heinrich was first married<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> to [[Princess Sophie of Luxembourg]],<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> sixth and youngest daughter<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> of [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] and his wife [[Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal]],<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> on 12 April 1921 at [[Schloss Hohenburg]].<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> Ernst Heinrich and Sophie had three sons:<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>\n\n*'''Prince Albrecht Friedrich August Johannes Gregor ''Dedo'' of Saxony''' (born 9 May 1922 in [[Munich]];<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/> died 6 December 2009 in [[Radebeul]], Germany).<ref>[http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/dresden/aktuell/2009/12/07/wettiner-prinz-dedo/ist-tot.html Wettiner prinz Dedo ist tot]</ref><ref>http://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2009/12/death-of-prince-dedo-of-saxony.html</ref>  Never married or had issue.\n*'''Prince Georg ''Timo'' Michael Nikolaus Maria of Saxony''' (born 22 December 1923 in [[Munich]]; died 22 April 1982 in [[Emden]]).<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  He married three times:  \n**first to Margrit Lucas (1923-1957) on 7 August 1952, by whom he had two children, [[Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony|R\u00fcdiger Karl Ernst Timo Aldi]] (born 23 December 1953, head of house since 2012) and Iris Hildegard Sophie Margit Gisela (born 21 September 1955); \n**second from 1966-1973 to Charlotte Schwindack (born 1919), from whom he was divorced; \n**and third to Erina Eilts (1921-2010) in 1974. \n**Before his marriages, he also had a son by Erika Montanus, Hubertus von Sachsen, (born 25 May 1950).<ref>http://thepeerage.com/p11107.htm#i111068</ref>\n*'''Prince Rupprecht Hubertus ''Gero'' Maria of Saxony''' (born 12 September 1925 in [[Munich]]; died 10 April 2003 in [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]])<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  Never married or had issue.\n\nSophie died on 24 May 1941 in [[Munich]] of pneumonia.<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/><ref>Cause of death: \"Geschichte des Hauses Wettin von seinen Anfaengen bis zur Gegenwart\" (\"History of the House of Wettin From Its Origins To the Present\") at http://www.prinz-albert-von-sachsen.de/inhalt/historie/hist_haus_wettin.htm</ref> Following her death, Ernst Heinrich married [[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]] Virginia Dulon (1910-2002) on 28 June 1947 in [[Paris]].<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>  This marriage was without issue.<ref name=thePeerage/><ref name=OnlineGotha/>\n\n==Titles, styles and honours==\n===Titles and styles===\n*'''9 December 1896 \u2013 14 June 1971''': ''His Royal Highness'' Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony, Duke of Saxony\n\n===Honours===\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Prussia}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]]<ref name=\"p108\">Justus Perthes, ''Almanach de Gotha 1923'' (1923) [https://archive.org/details/almanachdegotha00unse_94/page/108 pp. 108-109]</ref>\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Saxony}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Rue Crown]]<ref name=\"p108\"/>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

When conditions are right, [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of phytoplankton algae can occur in surface waters. Phytoplankton are [[r-strategist]]s which grow rapidly and can double their population every day. The blooms can become toxic and deplete the water of oxygen.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

When conditions are right, [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of phytoplankton algae can occur in surface waters. Phytoplankton are [[r-strategist]]s which grow rapidly and can double their population every day. The blooms can become toxic and deplete the water of oxygen.

Marine microorganisms also recycle nutrients for use in the [[marine food web]] and in the process release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Microbial biomass and other organic matter (remnants of plants and animals) are converted to fossil fuels over millions of years. By contrast, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s liberates greenhouse gases in a small fraction of that time. As a result, the [[carbon cycle]] is out of balance, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels will continue to rise as long as fossil fuels continue to be burnt.<ref name=Cavicchioli2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Cavicchioli | first1 = R. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Timmis | first3 = K.N. | last4 = Azam | first4 = F. | last5 = Bakken | first5 = L.R. | last6 = Baylis | first6 = M. | last7 = Behrenfeld | first7 = M.J. | last8 = Boetius | first8 = A. | last9 = Boyd | first9 = P.W. | last10 = Classen | first10 = A.T. | last11 = Crowther | first11 = T.W. | year = 2019 | title = Scientists' warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 9| pages = 569\u2013586 | doi = 10.1038/s41579-019-0222-5 | pmid = 31213707 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Marine life]]\n* [[Deep chlorophyll maximum]]\n* [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]]\n* [[International Census of Marine Microbes]]\n* [[Marine microbial symbiosis]]\n* [[Microbial biogeography]]\n* [[Microbial communities]]\n* [[Microbial ecology]]\n* [[Microbial food web]]\n* [[Microbial loop]]\n* [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur]]\n** [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]]\n* [[Microbially induced sedimentary structure]]\n* [[Microbiology of oxygen minimum zones]]\n* [[Oceanic carbon cycle]]\n* [[Ooid]]\n* [[Picoeukaryote]]\n* [[Roseobacter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n* Haq B.U. and Boersma A.
