[[Hindus]], adherents of [[folk religions]] and [[Buddhists]] are expected to experience the greatest growth as a percentage of their modest 2010 counts, with each group more than doubling in size by 2050.\n==Judaism==\nFor over 2,000 years a large portion of world Jewry lived in the Middle East. They are colloquially known as [[Mizrahi Jews]]. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Yemen. Since the 1950s because of growing antisemitism, most of these Jews fled to Israel where they make up the majority of Israel's Jewish population and roughly a third of total world Jewry. While they no longer live among a Muslim majority, they continue to follow many customs with strong Muslim and Middle Eastern influences making them distinct from European Jewry.\nToday [[Judaism]] in the Middle East is mostly practiced in Israel. Israel's population is 75.3% Jewish, with the remainder made up of Muslims (20.6%), [[Christians]], [[Druze]], [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] and various other minorities (4.1%).<ref>http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/?MIval=cw_usr_view_SHTML&ID=705</ref> There are few other countries in the Middle East with significant Jewish populations, but the communities are small and scattered.\n\n==Christianity==\n{{See also|Christianity in the Middle East}}\nChristianity [[Origins of Christianity|originated]] in the region in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the mid-to-late 7th century AD.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era. Another name, ''Ansari'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''An\u1e63\u0101riyyah''), is believed to be a mistransliteration of ''Nusayri''. Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which is also inhabited by Sunnis, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]].\n\nAlawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref><ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God.\n\nAlawites have traditionally lived in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains]] along the Mediterranean coast of Syria.

The majority of displaced and upset Palestinians are Muslim and the majority of current Israeli citizens are Jewish so establishing the state borders is highly influenced by religion.\n\nOne of the main difficulties in establishing peace between the two countries is because of [[Jerusalem]]. Each of the three main religions is incredibly attached to this city and claim it as their own. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether Palestinian Territories or Israel will encompass this region. Maps produced within the territories represent Jerusalem differently. Palestinian maps draw Jerusalem as divided and Israeli maps show it as a part of Israeli territory.<ref name=Israel>{{cite journal|last=Collins-Kreiner|first=Y|author2=Mansfeld, Kliot |title=The Reflection of a Political Conflict in Mapping: The Case of Israel's borders and Frontiers|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=11 August 2006|volume=42|issue=3|pages=381\u2013408|doi=10.1080/00263200500521230}}</ref>\n\n===Jordan===\n[[Religion in Jordan]] is represented by 92% Muslim (Sunni), 6% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and 2% other.<ref name=Percents />\n\n===Lebanon===\n[[File:ChurchMosque.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Maronite Cathedral]] and the [[Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque]], Beirut. 41% in [[Lebanon]] is [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] representing the mosaic of the Middle East, and contributing heavily in the Media, Politics, Entertainment, Banking... sectors in Lebanon and the World.]]\n\n[[Religion in Lebanon]] is the most unique{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=March 2015}} in the Middle East, and a mix of religions make up [[Lebanon]], represented by 59% [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] ([[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi'a]], [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]], [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], [[Ismailis in Lebanon|Isma'ilite]], [[Alawites in Lebanon|Alawite/Nusayri]]), 41% [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] ([[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite]], and Christian churches non-native to Lebanon like [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Armenian Catholic Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant]]).

In the Palatinate of Durham the officeholder was appointed by and was accountable to the Bishop of Durham until 1836 when the Crown claimed authority. The High Sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer in the county but over the centuries most of the responsibilities associated with the post have been transferred elsewhere or are now defunct, so that its functions are now largely ceremonial. The High Sheriff changes every March.\n\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n==High Sheriffs of County Durham==\n*1146 Osbert\n\n==15th century==\n*18 January 1401: Sir Robert Conyers{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}\n*24 August 1406: Sir Percival de Lyndeley{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}\n*2 June 1414: Sir William Claxton{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}\n*2 January 1420: Robert Eure{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}\n*6 May 1436: Sir William Bowes{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}\n*4 October 1437: [[Ogle family|Robert Ogle]]{{sfn|Hughes|1898|p=42}}<ref name=HAD150>''The History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham'' Vol I.

This specific use of cedar is mentioned in ''[[The Iliad]]'', Book 24, referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam went to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'', which is different from the true cedars; note also common confusion with ''Thuja'' species (below). Cedar is also commonly used to make [[shoe trees]] because it can absorb moisture and deodorise.\n\nMany species of cedar are suitable for training as [[bonsai]]. They work well for many styles, including formal and informal upright, slanting, and cascading.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walston|first1=Brent|title=Cedars for Bonsai|url=https://www.evergreengardenworks.com/cedars.htm|website=evergreengardenworks.com|accessdate=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529033650/http://www.evergreengardenworks.com/cedars.htm|archive-date=29 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, ''[[Thuja]]'' species such as [[western red cedar]] are commonly, though mistakenly, confused with genuine cedars, as is ''J. virginiana'', colloquially denominated \"red cedar\" or \"eastern red cedar\". While some naturalized ''Cedrus'' species grow in the Americas, none are native.\n\n==Etymology==\nBoth the Latin word ''cedrus'' and the generic name ''cedrus'' are derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''k\u00e9dros''.  Ancient Greek and Latin used the same word, ''k\u00e9dros'' and ''cedrus'', respectively, for different species of plants now classified in the genera ''Cedrus'' and ''Juniperus'' ([[juniper]]).  Species of both genera are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word ''k\u00e9dros'' does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the [[Middle East]], it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus ''Cedrus'' because of the similarity of their aromatic woods.<ref>Meiggs, R. 1982.  Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World.</ref>  The name was similarly applied to [[citron]] and the word [[citrus]] is derived from the same root.<ref name=andrews>Andrews, A. C.  1961.  Acclimatization of citrus fruits in the Mediterranean region.  ''Agricultural History'' 35: 35&ndash;46.</ref>  However, as a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its [[bible|biblical]] sense of ''Cedrus'' by the time of its first recorded usage in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;1000.<ref name=oed>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref>\n\nThe name \"cedar\" has more recently been applied (since about 1700<ref name=oed/>) to many other trees (such as [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]]; in some cases, the botanical name alludes to this usage, such as the genus ''[[Calocedrus]]'' (meaning \"beautiful cedar\", also known as ''incense cedar'').  Such usage is regarded by some authorities <ref name=kelsey>Kelsey, H. P., & Dayton, W. A. (1942). ''Standardized Plant Names'', second edition.

This specific use of cedar is mentioned in ''[[The Iliad]]'', Book 24, referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam went to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'', which is different from the true cedars; note also common confusion with ''Thuja'' species (below). Cedar is also commonly used to make [[shoe trees]] because it can absorb moisture and deodorise.\n\nMany species of cedar are suitable for training as [[bonsai]]. They work well for many styles, including formal and informal upright, slanting, and cascading.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walston|first1=Brent|title=Cedars for Bonsai|url=https://www.evergreengardenworks.com/cedars.htm|website=evergreengardenworks.com|accessdate=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529033650/http://www.evergreengardenworks.com/cedars.htm|archive-date=29 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, ''[[Thuja]]'' species such as [[western red cedar]] are commonly, though mistakenly, confused with genuine cedars, as is ''J. virginiana'', colloquially denominated \"red cedar\" or \"eastern red cedar\". While some naturalized ''Cedrus'' species grow in the Americas, none are native.\n\n==Etymology==\nBoth the Latin word ''cedrus'' and the generic name ''cedrus'' are derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''k\u00e9dros''.  Ancient Greek and Latin used the same word, ''k\u00e9dros'' and ''cedrus'', respectively, for different species of plants now classified in the genera ''Cedrus'' and ''Juniperus'' ([[juniper]]).  Species of both genera are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word ''k\u00e9dros'' does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the [[Middle East]], it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus ''Cedrus'' because of the similarity of their aromatic woods.<ref>Meiggs, R. 1982.  Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World.</ref>  The name was similarly applied to [[citron]] and the word [[citrus]] is derived from the same root.<ref name=andrews>Andrews, A. C.  1961.  Acclimatization of citrus fruits in the Mediterranean region.  ''Agricultural History'' 35: 35&ndash;46.</ref>  However, as a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its [[bible|biblical]] sense of ''Cedrus'' by the time of its first recorded usage in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;1000.<ref name=oed>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.</ref>\n\nThe name \"cedar\" has more recently been applied (since about 1700<ref name=oed/>) to many other trees (such as [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]]; in some cases, the botanical name alludes to this usage, such as the genus ''[[Calocedrus]]'' (meaning \"beautiful cedar\", also known as ''incense cedar'').  Such usage is regarded by some authorities <ref name=kelsey>Kelsey, H. P., & Dayton, W. A. (1942). ''Standardized Plant Names'', second edition. American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature. Horace McFarland Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</ref> as a misapplication of the name to be discouraged.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cedars of God]] in the [[Kadisha Valley]] of [[Bsharri]], [[Lebanon]]\n* [[Cedar wood]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Cedrus}}\n\n{{Pinaceae}}\n{{Woodworking}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q128550}}\n\n[[Category:Cedrus| ]]\n[[Category:Conifer genera]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Wood]]\n", "name_user": "Old Man Consequences", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTaxa", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrus"}

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design. NEC might be able to throw away its [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]], and to reconsider in [[register-transfer level]] as soon as possible, but it did not.\n\n=== Fading ===\nThe V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.<ref name=\"Meth\u00e91991\"/>\n\nThe V60, V70, and V80 were listed in 1989 and 1990 NEC catalogs in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] packaging.<ref name=\"cat89\"/><ref name=\"cat90\"/> A NEC catalog from 1995 still listed the V60 and V70 (not only in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] version but also in a [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] packaging, and also included a low-cost variant of the V60 named \u03bcPD70615, which eliminated V20/V30 emulation and FRM function), alongside their assorted chipset, but the V80 is not offered in this catalog.<ref name=\"cat95\"/> The 1999 edition of the same catalog no longer has any V60-V80 products.<ref name=\"cat99\"/>\n\n=== {{anchor|NEC V810|NEC V820|NEC V830|\u03bcPD70732|\u03bcPD70742}}The V800&nbsp;Series ===\n\nIn 1992, NEC launched new model, the V800&nbsp;Series 32-bit [[microcontroller]], but it did not have [[Memory management unit|MMU (Memory Management Unit)]].<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\"/> It had [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based architecture, inspired by the [[Intel i960]], [[MIPS architecture]], and other [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] processor instructions, such as JARL (Jump and Register Link), and [[load/store architecture]].\n\nAt this moment, all the huge software assets of the V60/V70, like real-time Unix, were lost and never returned to their successors. The scenario Intel circumvents.\n\nThe V800&nbsp;Series had 3 product line variants, the V810&nbsp;Family, the V830&nbsp;Family, and the [[V850|V850&nbsp;Family]].<ref name=\"EDN\"/><ref name=\"IEIEC-1995\"/><ref name=\"IEEE-1998\"/>\n\nV820 (\u03bcPD70742) was a simple variant of V810 (\u03bcPD70732) with peripherals. The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58 <ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].  One [[Japanese pronunciation]] of \"4\" means \"death.\" So the successors well avoid the [[Deathwatch beetle|Death-watch]]; Shi-ban (#4; Shi-ban) ''[[Software bug|Bug]]'' ({{nihongo2|[[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|\u6b7b\u756a\u866b]]}}, precisely ''[[deathwatch beetle]]''). As of 2005, it was already the [[V850]] era, and the [[V850]]&nbsp;Family has been enjoying great success.<ref name=\"cat05\"/> As of 2018, it is called Renesas V850&nbsp;Family and RH850&nbsp;Family with V850/V850E1/V850E2 and V850E2/V850E3 CPU cores, respectively.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

However, unlike NEC, their FPU function is off chip.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!------------------->\n<!----- CATALOG ----->\n<!------------------->\n\n<ref name=\"cat-fr\">\n{{cite web|author1=NEC|title=Microprocessors and Peripherals Data Book|url=http://matthieu.benoit.free.fr/cross/data_sheets/NEC_Microprocessors-and-Peripherals_Data_Book.htm}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cat89\">\n{{cite book|author1=NEC|title=Intelligent Peripheral Devices Data Book|url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_necdataBootPeripheralDevicesDataBook_33483764|publisher=The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit|page=18|date=June 1989}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cat90\">\n{{cite book|author1=NEC|title=Single-Chip Microcontroller Data Book|url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_necdatabooMicrocontrollerDataBook_57118308|publisher=The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit|page=30|date=May 1990}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cat95\">\n{{cite web|author1=NEC|title=SEMICONDUCTOR SELECTION GUIDE|edition=10th|date=Oct 1995|url=http://icbank.com/data/ICBShop/board/D72611GF.pdf}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cat99\">\n{{cite web|author1=NEC|title=SEMICONDUCTORS SELECTION GUIDE|edition=17th|url=http://www.littlediode.com/datasheets/pdf/Datasheets-NEC/NEC-SHORTFORM.PDF|date=April 1999}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cat05\">\n{{cite web|title=Microcontrollers and Development Tools Selection Guide|url=http://www1.futureelectronics.com/doc/RENESAS%20ELECTRONICS/NECMicrocontrollerGuide%5B1%5D.pdf|author=NEC|date=May 2005}}\n</ref>\n\n<!------------------------>\n<!----- WEB MATERIAL ----->\n<!------------------------>\n\n<!----- WEB, ACADEMIC ----->\n\n<ref name=ric-tan>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/sts145papers/rtan_2001_2.pdf|author=Richard Tan|title=STS 145 Case Study Sega: The effect of corporate conflict on game design| quote=<br/>\"The Saturn originally ran on a NEC V60 chip at 16MHz. Compare this to the PlayStation CPU ([[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000A 32bit [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] chip) which runs are 33.8MHz, almost double the speed. According to one Sega staff member, when Nakayama first received design specifications for the PlayStation, he was \u2018the maddest I have ever seen him\u2019, calling up the entire R&D division to his office to shout at them. An effort was made to compensate by adding another CPU for dual operation; however, this solution made the system so hard to develop for that, according to Yu Suzuki himself, \u201conly 1 out of 100 programmers could use the Saturn to its full potential.\u201d\"}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, NEC ----->\n\n<ref name=\"ps98-145-hmw\">\n{{Cite web|url=http://121ware.com/support/product/data/spec/sft/sw225d-1.html |title=Model Number: PS98-145-HMW, Item Name: PC-UX/V(Rel2.0)(V60) |publisher=NEC product sheet}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, GHS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"GHS-V850\">\n{{cite web|title=V850 and RH850 Embedded Software Solutions|url=https://www.ghs.com/products/v850_development.html|website=www.ghs.com|publisher=Green Hills Software}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MIPS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"HIREC-HR5000\">\n{{cite web|last1=Voica|first1=Alex|title=Back to the future: 64-bit MIPS CPU explores the origins of the solar system \u2013 MIPS|url=https://www.mips.com/blog/back-to-the-future-64-bit-mips-cpu-explores-rare-asteroid/|website=www.mips.com|publisher=MIPS|language=en|date=2015-07-29}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MIPS64-5Kf-DS\">\n{{cite book|title=MIPS64 5Kf Processor Core Datasheet|date=2005-01-31|publisher=MIPS Technologies Inc.|edition=01.04|url=http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/w/images/f/f1/MD00111-2B-4KEC-DTS-02.03.pdf|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MAME DEV ----->\n\n<ref name=\"v60-cemu\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |title=MAME:/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070653/http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403190647/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-model1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/model1.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403180645/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-ssv\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403215238/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-mc32\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403182226/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, PLANET VIRTUAL BOY ----->\n\n<ref name=\"V810-GCC\">\n{{cite web|title=A newer GCC compiler. \u00ab Virtual Boy Development Board \u00ab Forum \u00ab Planet Virtual Boy|url=http://www.planetvb.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6456|website=www.planetvb.com|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, DATAQUEST ----->\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1986\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1986, p. 18 (pdf p. 44 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1987, p. 18 (pdf p. 182 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987-2\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 2nd Quarter 1987, p. 21 (pdf p. 223 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW ----->\n\n<ref name=\"CBR-1\">\nNEC LAUNCHES V80 ANSWER TO INTEL's 80486 -

In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

A variety of techniques previously associated only with RISC (reduced-instruction-set computer) processors are used to execute the average instruction in 1.8 clocks. This represents a 2.5* reduction from its predecessor, the 386 microprocessor. The pipeline and clock count comparisons are described in detail. In addition, an onchip floating-point unit is included which yields a 4* clock count reduction from the 387 numeric coprocessor. The microarchitecture enhancements and optimizations used to achieve this goal, most of which are non-silicon-intensive, are discussed. All instructions of the 386 microprocessor and the 387 numeric coprocessor are implemented in a completely compatible fashion.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=J.H.|title=The i486 CPU: executing instructions in one clock cycle|journal=IEEE Micro|date=February 1990|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27\u201336|doi=10.1109/40.46766|issn=0272-1732|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.4216}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pj\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Hal W | title=RISCs CISCs and Fabs|journal=Programmer's Journal|year=1988|publisher=Avant-Garde Creations|volume=6|issue=2|page=15|quote=<br/>So far we haven't mentioned two 32-bit CISC chips, the NEC V60/70 and the AT&T WE32 family.

The line stops at seven stations: [[Riverfront Station|Riverfront]], [[Donelson Station|Donelson]], [[Hermitage Station|Hermitage]], [[Mt. Juliet Station|Mt.

Expansion plans include as many as six more lines, terminating in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]], [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]], [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]], [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], and [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] via [[Ashland City, Tennessee|Ashland City]]. All are planned to use existing [[CSX Transportation]] railroad lines. The planned seven lines meet in central Nashville in a star formation, hence the name of the system, which also alludes to the city's many [[country music]] [[celebrity|stars]].\n\nThe Star is the first [[passenger train]] service of any kind for Nashville since the discontinuation of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] ''[[Floridian (train)|Floridian]]'' in 1979. The [[Nashville and Eastern Railroad|Nashville and Eastern line]], part of the former [[Tennessee Central Railway]], had not seen passenger service for many decades prior to the Star, with the exception of excursion trains operated by the [[Tennessee Central Railway Museum]] and the Broadway Dinner Train.\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Expansion plans include as many as six more lines, terminating in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]], [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]], [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]], [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], and [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] via [[Ashland City, Tennessee|Ashland City]]. All are planned to use existing [[CSX Transportation]] railroad lines. The planned seven lines meet in central Nashville in a star formation, hence the name of the system, which also alludes to the city's many [[country music]] [[celebrity|stars]].\n\nThe Star is the first [[passenger train]] service of any kind for Nashville since the discontinuation of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] ''[[Floridian (train)|Floridian]]'' in 1979. The [[Nashville and Eastern Railroad|Nashville and Eastern line]], part of the former [[Tennessee Central Railway]], had not seen passenger service for many decades prior to the Star, with the exception of excursion trains operated by the [[Tennessee Central Railway Museum]] and the Broadway Dinner Train.\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The line is mostly [[Single-track railway|single-track]], so this limits arrivals and departures to how long each train has to wait for the other to pass.
