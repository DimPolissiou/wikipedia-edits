French is generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. The parliamentary debates are however mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas the written government communications and the official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports etc.) are drafted only in French.\n\nEach of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres of everyday life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is not often used as the written language and the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 60% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other. Since the 1980s, however, an increasing number of novels have been written in Luxembourgish. Most official business is carried out in French.

Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is not often used as the written language and the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 60% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other.

The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the [[2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship]]. The [[national stadium]] (also the country's largest) is the [[Stade Josy Barthel]], in western Luxembourg City; named after the country's only official Olympic gold medallist, the stadium has a capacity of 8,054.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Luxembourg cuisine}}\n[[File:JuddMatGaardebounen Beer.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Judd mat Gaardebounen]]'', served with boiled potatoes and [[Diekirch]] beer]]\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\n\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring [[German cuisine|Germany]].\n\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm |title=World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption 2009 |publisher=Finfacts.ie |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |title=Consommation annuelle moyenne d'alcool par habitant, Catholic Ministry of Health |work=sante.gouv.fr |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112184246/https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu |title=Luxemburger Wort |work=Wort.lu |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tns-ilres.com/cms/Home |title=TNS ILRES \u2013 Home |publisher=Tns-ilres.com |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> is conducted in French.\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations ([[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[RTL Group]]). It is also the uplink home of [[SES S.A.|SES]], carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\n\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual
