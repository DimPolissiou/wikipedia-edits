It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [https://www.ggcl.in/blog/10-Ceramic-Wall-Tile-(BIII) porcelain]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.\n\nMost [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[biscuit porcelain]], [[terracotta]], or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.\n\nThe most important groups of traditional glazes, each named after its main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:\n\n*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. \n*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.\n*[[Lead-glazed earthenware|Lead glazes]], plain or coloured, are shiny and transparent after firing, which need only about {{convert|800|C}}.

Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. \n \nRaw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA694&dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S.

Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.\n\nTo prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it is supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.\n\nDecoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, \"greenware\", or \"[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]\"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).<ref>\"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware\" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.\n\nOverglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.\n\nGlazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.

It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.\n\nMost [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[biscuit porcelain]], [[terracotta]], or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.\n\nThe most important groups of traditional glazes, each named after its main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:\n\n*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. \n*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.\n*[[Lead-glazed earthenware|Lead glazes]], plain or coloured, are shiny and transparent after firing, which need only about {{convert|800|C}}.  They have been used for about 2,000 years in China ''e.g. [[sancai]]'', around the Mediterranean, and in Europe e.g. [[Victorian majolica]].\n*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glaze]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.\n*[[Tin-glazed pottery|Tin-glaze]], which coats the ware with lead glaze made opaque white by the addition of tin.<ref>C D Fortnum, 1875, Maiolica, Chapter II on Enamelled or Stanniferous Glazed Wares \"It was found that by the addition of a certain portion of the oxide of tin to the composition of glass and oxide of lead the character of the glaze entirely alters. Instead of being translucent it becomes, on fusion, an opaque and beautifully white enamel\u2026\"</ref> Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes Hispano-Moresque ware, [[maiolica]] (also called [[majolica]]), [[faience]], and [[Delftware]].\n\nModern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.\n\n==Composition==\nGlazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. \n \nRaw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA694&dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S.

Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.\n\nTo prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it is supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.\n\nDecoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, \"greenware\", or \"[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]\"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).<ref>\"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware\" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.\n\nOverglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.\n\nGlazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.<ref name=\"gao\">{{cite book\n| first= Gao\n| last= Daiheng\n| year= 2002\n| title= Chinese Architecture \u2013 The Lia, Song, Xi Xia and Jin Dynasties\n| edition= English\n| publisher= Yale University Press\n| location= \n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/chinesearchitect0000unse/page/166 166, 183]\n| isbn= 978-0-300-09559-3\n| url= https://archive.org/details/chinesearchitect0000unse/page/166\n}}</ref>\n\nLead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 \u2013 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty.
