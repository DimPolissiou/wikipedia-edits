''fantasies of the good'' is a series of 13 detailed charcoal life drawings of different members of Ah Kee's family, who are all identified by name. The series uses a [[mug-shot]] style and is suggested to reference the documentation of [[Indigenous Australians]] by some [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] in the twentieth century; the Indigenous people who were documented were unnamed and the works were rather referred to by numbers. Ah Kee wanted to convey Australia's history of racism and has stated that \"These drawings and what they represent are my evidence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mca.com.au/artists-works/works/20061113/|title=Dennis Ah Kee (Uncle Dennis) from fantasies of the good {{!}} MCA Australia|website=www.mca.com.au|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>.

In ''Tall Man'', Ah Kee collected and edited footage from the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody|Palm Island riots]], an event that occurred after the death of Indigenous man Cameron Doomadgee in police custody, and retold the controversial story from an Indigenous perspective.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mca.com.au/artists-works/works/201619/|title=tall man {{!}} MCA Australia|website=www.mca.com.au|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> The installation played across four screens and juxtaposed a peaceful representation of [[Great Palm Island|Palm Island]] with the chaos of the riots, concluding with footage of protesters holding up signs with [[Christianity|Christian]]-related statements such as \"Thou shalt not covet the land no more\". Maura Reilly suggests this was to reference the hypocrisy of white Australian Christians in their treatment of Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHis recent work, ''the island'', also features a video installation, in which Ah Kee highlights Australia's \"brutal\" immigration system through the recounting of an [[Afghans in Australia|Afghani]] refugee couple's story, rather than wholly focusing on the experiences of Indigenous Australians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/-Someone-s-Got-to-Deal-With-That-Fire---/FC0DB2F158C33828|title=Vernon Ah Kee's The Island:|website=www.mutualart.com|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== proppaNOW ===\n{{main| ProppaNOW}}\nAlong with  [[Richard Bell (artist)|Richard Bell]], [[Jennifer Herd]] and [[Joshua Herd]], all artists based in Brisbane, Ah Kee is a founding member of [[proppaNOW]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Bell had stated in 2002: \"Aboriginal art \u2013 its a white thing\", saying that the industry was controlled by white people,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uow.edu.au/media/2018/aboriginal-art-is-it-a-white-thing.php|title=2018: Aboriginal art: is it a white thing? \u2013 University of Wollongong \u2013 UOW|website=www.uow.edu.au|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> a sentiment echoed by Ah Kee.<ref name=\":13\" /> The ProppaNOW artists seek to refute the white belief that remote Indigenous Australians are the only true Aboriginal people, and to re-establish the presence of urban Indigenous people in society.

Senior Curator at the [[National Museum of Australia]], [[Margo Neale]], suggested that the work's deliberate misuse of [[deicide]] was a comment on the role of [[Christianity|Christian-based religions]] in the \"cultural terrorism\" of Aboriginal people, and that the manipulation of colonial language in the work was a common \"tactical device used by the proppaNOW artists\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Dark + Disturbing===\n''Dark + Disturbing'' is a curatorial project by Ah Kee.<ref name=dadabout>{{cite web | title=About | website=Dark and Disturbing | date=21 June 2016 | url=https://www.darkanddisturbing.com.au/about/ | access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> In August 2015, he mounted the exhibition ''Dark + Disturbing: Gordon Hookey for proppaNOW'' at the[[Cairns Indigenous Art Fair]], featuring the work of fellow collaborator in proppaNow, [[Gordon Hookey]].<ref name=dad2015>{{cite web | title=Dark+Disturbing features Gordon Hookey at Cairns Indigenous Art Fair 2015|first1=Leesa |last1=Watego|first2=Vernon|last2=Ah Kee| website=Dark and Disturbing | date=9 August 2015 | url=https://www.darkanddisturbing.com.au/gordon-hookey-ciaf-2015/ | access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Reviews and criticisms of his art ===\nAh Kee has generally received positive reviews of his art, often being praised for his clever reinventions of colonial language to highlight racism in Australia and noted for the dual personal and political nature of his art.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.art-almanac.com.au/2014-redlands-konica-minolta-art-prize-winners-announced/|title=2014 Redlands Konica Minolta Art Prize {{!}} Winners announced|date=15 April 2014|website=Art Almanac|language=en-US|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> His ''Tall Man'' exhibition, a video and text installation of the Palm Island Riots, was called a \"smartly composed yet painful examination of racial relations in Australia\" by ''[[Art Asia Pacific Magazine]]''.<ref name=\":12\">Maura Reilly, Vernon Ah Kee: Tall Man, Art and Asia Pacific Magazine, no. 73 May & June 2011, pp. 136</ref>\n\nArt critic and broadcaster [[Andrew Frost (arts writer)|Andrew Frost]] reviewed some of Ah Kee's works at the [[Sydney Festival]] and quotes the artist: \"this is not history, this is my life\" and \"this is not political, it's personal\". Frost gave particular praise for the artist's [[Charcoal (art)|charcoal drawing]]s of his family, the form referencing the documentation of Indigenous peoples by 20th century anthropologists, finding that Ah Kee was personalising a traditionally impersonal genre.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Frost|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/09/vernon-ah-kee-review-racism-dominates-show-that-should-not-be-missed|title=Vernon Ah Kee review \u2013 racism and politics dominate show that should not be dismissed|date=9 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 February 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ah Kee was awarded the [[Redlands Konica Minolta Art Prize]], one of the judges, [[National Art School]] Curator Judith Blackall, also noted the dual political and personal nature of Ah Kee's work and how it impacts the audience. In regard to his portrait of Lex Wotton, she stated that \u201cVernon\u2019s masterful drawing technique of charcoal and acrylic paint on canvas goes from strength to strength. This portrait is particularly powerful as it shows Lex Wotton \u2013 who the artist knows well as he is married to Vernon\u2019s cousin \u2013 in profile, with an intense gaze. Importantly, the story behind the portrait is of great significance, both personally for the artist and politically for Australia\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn Ah Kee's 2020 exhibition, ''The Island'', Andrew Brooks suggested that the show was criticising the romanticised, white settler mythology of Australia and was trying to remind the audience of Australia's indigenous presence. Unlike Frost, Brooks determined the inclusion of the Yuendumu doors to be \"a powerful statement about the continuity of Indigenous sovereignty in this country\", especially in their juxtaposition with the Walpiri [[Dreamtime]] paintings. Brooks judged that the contrast between the racist graffiti of Yuendumu doors and the \"vibrant\" Dreamtime paintings indicated that indigenous culture was more than what white Australian culture limited it to be.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://rundog.art/the-island-vernon-ah-kee-part-one/|title=The Island (Part 1) \u2013 Vernon Ah Kee|last=Riddle|first=Naomi|date=5 February 2020|website=Running Dog|language=en-AU|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\nIn 2012, Ah Kee was a finalist for the Art Gallery of New South Wales' [[Archibald Prize]] with his portrait ''I see deadly people: Lex Wotton''.

He is an [[Aboriginal Australian]] man with ties to the [[Kuku Yalandji]], [[Waanji]], [[Yidinji]] and [[Gugu Yimithirr]] peoples in [[Queensland]], Australia. His art practice typically focuses on his [[Aboriginal Australian identity]] and place within a modern Australian framework. He is a contemporary artist, based primarily in [[Brisbane]], and is regarded as one of Australia's most prominent, active artists. Ah Kee has exhibited his art at numerous galleries across Australia, including the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] (AGNSW)<ref name=\":11\" /> and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Australia]]. He has also exhibited internationally, most notably at the 2009 [[Venice Biennale]] and the 2015 [[Istanbul Biennial]], having been chosen to represent Australia.\n\nAh Kee has a very diverse art practice, using a broad range of techniques and media such as [[painting]], [[art installation|installation]], photography and text-based art. He is particularly renowned for his manipulation of colonial language and imagery to highlight racial issues in Australia. His exhibitions generally receive positive reviews and his works are hosted in both public and private collections around the world.\n\nIn 2003, Ah Kee, along with other [[Indigenous Australian]] artists [[Richard Bell (artist)|Richard Bell]], [[Jennifer Herd]] and Joshua Herd, created ProppaNOW \u2013 an organisation dedicated to supporting urban Indigenous artists in Brisbane and combating cultural stereotypes.\n\nHe was awarded the [[Australia Council]]'s Visual Arts Fellowship in 2018.\n\n== Personal life and education==\n\nVernon Ah Kee was born in [[Innisfail, Queensland]] in 1967 to Merv and Margaret Ah Kee, who were [[Indigenous rights]] activists.<ref name=\":1\" /> Like most other Indigenous people in Australia, the family was not included in the population census until 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/01/19/not-animal-or-plant-putting-human-face-1967-referendum|title='Not an animal or a plant': Putting a human face to 1967 Referendum|website=NITV|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> He is an Aboriginal Australian, of the Kuku Yalandji, Waanji, Yidinji and Ggu Yimithirr peoples in Queensland. He also has some [[Chinese in Australia|Chinese ancestry]] from his great-grandfather, but Ah Kee has stated that he identifies more with his Indigenous heritage.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://artguide.com.au/vernon-ah-kee|title=Vernon Ah Kee at the National Art School Gallery|date=10 January 2017|website=Art Guide Australia|language=en-US|access-date=5 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis family moved to [[Cairns]] when he was a teenager, and Ah Kee sketched avidly at this time.<ref name=\":1\" />  \n[[File:Queensland College of Art Sidon St.JPG|thumb|Queensland College of the Art]]\nAh Kee started his Bachelor of [[Visual Art]] at [[Queensland College of Art]] in Brisbane in 1996.

He then went on to do [[honours degree|honours]] in [[fine art]] from 1999 to 2000, and then completed a [[doctorate]] in fine art from 2001 to 2007.

''fantasies of the good'' is a series of 13 detailed charcoal life drawings of different members of Ah Kee's family, who are all identified by name. The series uses a [[mug-shot]] style and is suggested to reference the documentation of [[Indigenous Australians]] by some [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] in the twentieth century; the Indigenous people who were documented were unnamed and the works were rather referred to by numbers. Ah Kee wanted to convey Australia's history of racism and has stated that \"These drawings and what they represent are my evidence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mca.com.au/artists-works/works/20061113/|title=Dennis Ah Kee (Uncle Dennis) from fantasies of the good {{!}} MCA Australia|website=www.mca.com.au|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>. His 2012 portrait, ''I see deadly people: Lex Wotton'', depicted the titular man through bold paint strokes<ref name=\":6\" /> Ah Kee explained that [[Lex Wotton|Wotton]]'s actions during the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody|Palm Island Riots]] led to him being negatively misrepresented in the media, and the artist decided that \"Lex should look bold and brave\" in his portrait.<ref name=\":6\" />  \n\nAh Kee has used video installation art, most notably in his exhibition ''Tall Man'', to create confronting reflections of Australian racism. In ''Tall Man'', Ah Kee collected and edited footage from the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody|Palm Island riots]], an event that occurred after the death of Indigenous man Cameron Doomadgee in police custody, and retold the controversial story from an Indigenous perspective.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mca.com.au/artists-works/works/201619/|title=tall man {{!}} MCA Australia|website=www.mca.com.au|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> The installation played across four screens and juxtaposed a peaceful representation of [[Great Palm Island|Palm Island]] with the chaos of the riots, concluding with footage of protesters holding up signs with [[Christian]]-related statements such as \"Thou shalt not covet the land no more\". Maura Reilly suggests this was to reference the hypocrisy of white Australian Christians in their treatment of Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHis recent work, ''the island'', also features a video installation, in which Ah Kee highlights Australia's \"brutal\" immigration system through the recounting of an [[Afghans in Australia|Afghani]] refugee couple's story, rather than wholly focusing on the experiences of Indigenous Australians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/-Someone-s-Got-to-Deal-With-That-Fire---/FC0DB2F158C33828|title=Vernon Ah Kee's The Island:|website=www.mutualart.com|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== proppaNOW ===\n{{main| ProppaNOW}}\nAlong with  [[Richard Bell (artist)|Richard Bell]], [[Jennifer Herd]] and [[Joshua Herd]], all artists based in Brisbane, Ah Kee is a founding member of [[proppaNOW]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Bell had stated in 2002: \"Aboriginal art \u2013 its a white thing\", saying that the industry was controlled by white people,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uow.edu.au/media/2018/aboriginal-art-is-it-a-white-thing.php|title=2018: Aboriginal art: is it a white thing? \u2013 University of Wollongong \u2013 UOW|website=www.uow.edu.au|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> a sentiment echoed by Ah Kee.<ref name=\":13\" /> The ProppaNOW artists seek to refute the white belief that remote Indigenous Australians are the only true Aboriginal people, and to re-establish the presence of urban Indigenous people in society. The founding members created the organisation after the the government's Queensland Indigenous Artists Marketing Export Agency (QIAMEA) appeared to focus more on Indigenous artists from rural communities than on those from urban areas.<ref name=\":4\" />  \n\nAt a [[Canberra]] proppaNOW exhibition in 2007, Ah Kee displayed his artwork ''You Deicide''. Senior Curator at the [[National Museum of Australia]], [[Margo Neale]], suggested that the work's deliberate misuse of [[deicide]] was a comment on the role of [[Christianity|Christian-based religions]] in the \"cultural terrorism\" of Aboriginal people, and that the manipulation of colonial language in the work was a common \"tactical device used by the proppaNOW artists\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Dark + Disturbing===\n''Dark + Disturbing'' is a curatorial project by Ah Kee.<ref name=dadabout>{{cite web | title=About | website=Dark and Disturbing | date=21 June 2016 | url=https://www.darkanddisturbing.com.au/about/ | access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> In August 2015, he mounted the exhibition ''Dark + Disturbing: Gordon Hookey for proppaNOW'' at the[[Cairns Indigenous Art Fair]], featuring the work of fellow collaborator in proppaNow, [[Gordon Hookey]].<ref name=dad2015>{{cite web | title=Dark+Disturbing features Gordon Hookey at Cairns Indigenous Art Fair 2015|first1=Leesa |last1=Watego|first2=Vernon|last2=Ah Kee| website=Dark and Disturbing | date=9 August 2015 | url=https://www.darkanddisturbing.com.au/gordon-hookey-ciaf-2015/ | access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Reviews and criticisms of his art ===\nAh Kee has generally received positive reviews of his art, often being praised for his clever reinventions of colonial language to highlight racism in Australia and noted for the dual personal and political nature of his art.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.art-almanac.com.au/2014-redlands-konica-minolta-art-prize-winners-announced/|title=2014 Redlands Konica Minolta Art Prize {{!}} Winners announced|date=15 April 2014|website=Art Almanac|language=en-US|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> His ''Tall Man'' exhibition, a video and text installation of the Palm Island Riots, was called a \"smartly composed yet painful examination of racial relations in Australia\" by ''[[Art Asia Pacific Magazine]]''.<ref name=\":12\">Maura Reilly, Vernon Ah Kee: Tall Man, Art and Asia Pacific Magazine, no. 73 May & June 2011, pp. 136</ref>\n\nArt critic and broadcaster [[Andrew Frost (arts writer)|Andrew Frost]] reviewed some of Ah Kee's works at the [[Sydney Festival]] and quotes the artist: \"this is not history, this is my life\" and \"this is not political, it's personal\". Frost gave particular praise for the artist's [[Charcoal (art)|charcoal drawing]]s of his family, the form referencing the documentation of Indigenous peoples by 20th century anthropologists, finding that Ah Kee was personalising a traditionally impersonal genre.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Frost|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/09/vernon-ah-kee-review-racism-dominates-show-that-should-not-be-missed|title=Vernon Ah Kee review \u2013 racism and politics dominate show that should not be dismissed|date=9 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 February 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ah Kee was awarded the [[Redlands Konica Minolta Art Prize]], one of the judges, [[National Art School]] Curator Judith Blackall, also noted the dual political and personal nature of Ah Kee's work and how it impacts the audience. In regard to his portrait of Lex Wotton, she stated that \u201cVernon\u2019s masterful drawing technique of charcoal and acrylic paint on canvas goes from strength to strength. This portrait is particularly powerful as it shows Lex Wotton \u2013 who the artist knows well as he is married to Vernon\u2019s cousin \u2013 in profile, with an intense gaze. Importantly, the story behind the portrait is of great significance, both personally for the artist and politically for Australia\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn Ah Kee's 2020 exhibition, ''The Island'', Andrew Brooks suggested that the show was criticising the romanticised, white settler mythology of Australia and was trying to remind the audience of Australia's indigenous presence. Unlike Frost, Brooks determined the inclusion of the Yuendumu doors to be \"a powerful statement about the continuity of Indigenous sovereignty in this country\", especially in their juxtaposition with the Walpiri [[Dreamtime]] paintings.

It can extend to an entire lifestyle that precludes animal products from all aspects of life. Besides food, vegans may also choose to avoid clothes that use products such as [[leather]] and [[fur]], [[cosmetics]] that have been [[Animal testing|tested on animals]], and [[blood sport]]s such as [[bullfighting]] and [[fox hunting]]. People who adopt veganism for ethical reasons may avoid or boycott all products or activities whose production or undertaking is perceived to [[animal exploitation|exploit animals]].

The botanist [[Charles Plumier]] had been his pupil and accompanied him on his voyages.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Travels Tournefort.svg|thumb|left|220px|Tournefort's research journeys]]\nTournefort was born in [[Aix-en-Provence]] and studied at the [[Jesuit]] convent there. It was intended that he enter the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], but the death of his father allowed him to follow his interest in botany.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nAfter two years collecting, he studied medicine at [[Montpellier]], but was appointed professor of botany at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] in [[Paris]] in 1683. During this time he travelled through [[Western Europe]], particularly the [[Pyrenees]], where he made extensive collections.\n\nBetween 1700 and 1702 he travelled through the islands of [[Greece]] and visited [[Constantinople]], the borders of the [[Black Sea]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], collecting plants and undertaking other types of observations. He was accompanied by the German botanist [[Andreas von Gundelsheimer|Andreas Gundelsheimer]] (1668\u20131715) and the artist [[Claude Aubriet]] (1651\u20131742).\nHis description of this journey was published posthumously (''Relation d'un voyage du Levant''),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  he himself having been killed by a carriage in Paris; the road on which he died now bears his name (Rue de Tournefort in the [[5\u00e8me arrondissement, Paris|5\u00e8me arrondissement]]).\n\n== Work ==\nTournefort's principal work was the 1694 ''El\u00e9ments de botanique, ou M\u00e9thode pour reconna\u00eetre les Plantes'' (the Latin translation of it ''Institutiones rei herbariae'' was published twice in 1700 and 1719). The principal artist was Claude Aubriet who later became the principal artist at the [[Jardin des Plantes]].   The classification followed was completely artificial, and neglected some important divisions established by earlier botanists, such as [[John Ray]]'s separation of the [[phanerogams]] from the [[cryptogams]], and his division of the flowering plants into [[monocot]]s and [[dicot]]s. Overall it was a step backwards in [[systematics]], yet the text was so clearly written and well structured, and contained so much valuable information on individual species, that it became popular amongst botanists, and nearly all classifications published for the next fifty years were based upon it.<ref name=\"Sachs 1890\">{{cite book |author=Sachs, Julius von; Garnsey, Henry E. F. (translator); Balfour, Isaac Bayley (editor) |year=1890 |title=[[Wikisource:History of Botany (1530\u20131860)|History of Botany (1530\u20131860)]] |publisher=Oxford at the Clarendon Press |pages=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\nTournefort is often credited with being the first to make a clear distinction between genus and species. Though he did indeed cluster the 7,000 plant species that he described into around 700 genera, this was not particularly original.

The botanist [[Charles Plumier]] had been his pupil and accompanied him on his voyages.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Travels Tournefort.svg|thumb|left|220px|Tournefort's research journeys]]\nTournefort was born in [[Aix-en-Provence]] and studied at the [[Jesuit]] convent there. It was intended that he enter the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], but the death of his father allowed him to follow his interest in botany.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nAfter two years collecting, he studied medicine at [[Montpellier]], but was appointed professor of botany at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] in [[Paris]] in 1683. During this time he travelled through [[Western Europe]], particularly the [[Pyrenees]], where he made extensive collections.\n\nBetween 1700 and 1702 he travelled through the islands of [[Greece]] and visited [[Constantinople]], the borders of the [[Black Sea]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], collecting plants and undertaking other types of observations. He was accompanied by the German botanist [[Andreas von Gundelsheimer|Andreas Gundelsheimer]] (1668\u20131715) and the artist [[Claude Aubriet]] (1651\u20131742).\nHis description of this journey was published posthumously (''Relation d'un voyage du Levant''),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  he himself having been killed by a carriage in Paris; the road on which he died now bears his name (Rue de Tournefort in the [[5\u00e8me arrondissement, Paris|5\u00e8me arrondissement]]).\n\n== Work ==\nTournefort's principal work was the 1694 ''El\u00e9ments de botanique, ou M\u00e9thode pour reconna\u00eetre les Plantes'' (the Latin translation of it ''Institutiones rei herbariae'' was published twice in 1700 and 1719). The principal artist was Claude Aubriet who later became the principal artist at the [[Jardin des Plantes]].   The classification followed was completely artificial, and neglected some important divisions established by earlier botanists, such as [[John Ray]]'s separation of the [[phanerogams]] from the [[cryptogams]], and his division of the flowering plants into [[monocot]]s and [[dicot]]s. Overall it was a step backwards in [[systematics]], yet the text was so clearly written and well structured, and contained so much valuable information on individual species, that it became popular amongst botanists, and nearly all classifications published for the next fifty years were based upon it.<ref name=\"Sachs 1890\">{{cite book |author=Sachs, Julius von; Garnsey, Henry E.

Though he did indeed cluster the 7,000 plant species that he described into around 700 genera, this was not particularly original. Concepts of genus and species had been framed as early as the 16th century, and [[Kaspar Bauhin]] in particular consistently distinguished genera and species.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 18th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Ryan Coogler]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Joe Robert Cole]], and stars <!-- Order per this source: https://news.marvel.com/movies/58647/marvel-studios-begins-production-black-panther-2/ -->[[Chadwick Boseman]] as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside [[Michael B. Jordan]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Danai Gurira]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Daniel Kaluuya]], [[Letitia Wright]], [[Winston Duke]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Andy Serkis]].<!-- Order per this source: https://news.marvel.com/movies/58647/marvel-studios-begins-production-black-panther-2/ --> In ''Black Panther'', T'Challa is crowned king of [[Wakanda]] following his father's death, but he is challenged by [[Erik Stevens|Killmonger]] (Jordan) who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and begin a global revolution.\n\n[[Wesley Snipes]] expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] was hired to write a script in January 2011. ''Black Panther'' was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making ''Black Panther'' the first Marvel film with a predominantly [[Black film|black cast]]. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], and [[Busan]], South Korea.\n\n''Black Panther'' premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16. The film received praise from critics for its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, though the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3&nbsp;billion worldwide and broke numerous [[List of Black Panther box office achievements|box office records]], including the highest-grossing film by a [[Black people|black]] director. It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->highest-grossing film]] of all time, the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|third-highest-grossing film]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2018]].\n\nThe film received numerous [[List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)|awards and nominations]], with seven nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with wins for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. ''Black Panther'' is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination, and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], two wins at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and twelve nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning three), among others.<!-- Please note.

One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of [[Wakanda]]. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a [[Third World]] country. In 1992, Wakanda's King [[T'Chaka]] visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in [[Oakland, California]]. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue]] with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. \n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" />}} his son [[T'Challa]] returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice [[Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] with his recuperation.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Black Panther cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|(L:R) Producer [[Kevin Feige]], director [[Ryan Coogler]], and actors [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Michael B.

Gurira said that the fighting skills she learned playing Michonne complemented the skills of Okoye,<ref name=\"GuriraMoG\" /> but noted that the Dora Milaje are a [[secret service]], which covers intel as well as fighting.

Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\".<ref name=\"CooglerVulture\" /> The film was also inspired by the comic runs of [[Jack Kirby]], [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), [[Jonathan Hickman]], and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.<ref name=\"ComingSoonSDCC\" /> The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Coogler had hoped to include [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kraven the Hunter]] early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available.<ref name=\"Kraven\" /> [[Donald Glover]] and his brother [[Stephen Glover (screenwriter)|Stephen]] made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]].<ref name=\"Glover\" /> Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was [[storyboard]]ed before being cut.<ref name=\"MooreHuffPostMay2018\" />\n\nFeige described ''Black Panther'' as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /> with ''Civil War'' laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> He also said the film would be a cross between ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\".<ref name=\"EWCoverJuly2017\" /> Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film ''[[A Prophet]]'' (2009) for inspiration.<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to [[Donald Trump]] becoming [[President of the United States]] after [[Barack Obama]], though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\"<ref name=\"EWBosemanJuly2017\" /> Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"FeigeGenreDescription\" /> ''Civil War'' did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the [[Xhosa language]], which Boseman was taught by [[John Kani]] who portrays T'Challa's father King [[T'Chaka]].<ref name=\"Xhosa\" /> Additional actors portraying Wakandans in ''Black Panther'' learned the language,<ref name=\"Nyongo/Film\" /> with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son [[Atandwa Kani|Atandwa]] served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.<ref name=\"NYTimesXhosa\" />\n\n==== Design ====\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,<ref name=\"Cole2\" /> rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\".<ref name=\"ColeAug2016\" /> Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country [[Lesotho]], a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly [[British colonization of Africa|colonized by the British]];<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /><ref name=\"LesothoVulture\" /> the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /> Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral [[coltan]] that can almost only be found in Congo.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,<ref name=\"NoManApe\" /> and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionDesign\" />\n\n===== Sets =====\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], pulling inspiration from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Ethiopia]],<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> as well as the designs of [[Zaha Hadid]],<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic [[Mali Empire]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].<ref name=\"CooglerTimbuktu\" /> Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a [[love letter]] to Africa.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern [[Afro-punk]] style of the Golden City, the capital.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> [[Rondavel]]s were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at [[Blyde River Canyon]] in South Africa.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" />\n\nBeachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by [[Lesotho]], the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on [[Nigerian]] writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|15}} including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the [[stainless steel]] look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the [[maglev]] and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the [[Congo peafowl]].<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" />\n\nThe majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the [[Oribi Gorge]]. The set was {{convert|36|ft}}, made up of a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|spell=in}} pool, and then {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} cliff faces that were designed to be extended to {{convert|100|ft}} with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with {{convert|25000|ft3}} of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===== Costumes =====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Masaai-women.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Dora Milaje in film.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The [[Maasai people]] of Kenya (top) inspired about 80% of the design of the [[Dora Milaje]], Wakanda's all-female special forces (bottom).<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nCostume designer [[Ruth E.

Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on [[samurai]], five percent on [[ninja]]s, and five percent on the [[Ifugao people]] from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the [[Southern Ndebele people]] and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nThe costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a [[kente cloth]] cloak with military boots.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /><ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.<ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" />\n\nHair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] had begun by January 21, 2017,<ref name=\"Freeman\" /><!-- Specific date source needed when available --> at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" /> under the working title ''Motherland''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"Busan\" /> Filming also took place in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the [[High Museum of Art]], which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and [[Atlanta City Hall]], which served as a United Nations building.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on ''Black Panther'' after working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'',<ref name=\"Arri\" /> first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from ''Civil War'' so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> She filmed in 3.4K [[ArriRaw]] with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]] cameras and [[Panavision]] Primo lenses,<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel [[LED]] light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an [[iPad]]. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.<ref name=\"Arri\" />\n\nShortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,<ref name=\"KanisConfirmed\" /> while on-set photographs revealed that [[Martin Freeman]] would reprise his role as [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref name=\"Freeman\" /> Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise his role as [[Ulysses Klaue]] from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWJan2017\" /><ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use \"Wakandan accents\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|22}} Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Since ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in ''Infinity War''.<ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" />\n\nAdditional filming took place in South Korea,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> with the city of [[Busan]] serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.<ref name=\"Busan\" /><ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), taking the best elements from each for ''Black Panther''{{'}}s sequence.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> Filming in Busan began on March 17,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> at the [[Jagalchi Fish Market]].<ref name=\"JagalchiFishMarket\" /> Filming moved to [[Gwangalli Beach]] on March 21,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> with other South Korean filming locations including [[Marine City, Busan|Marine City]] in the [[Haeundae District]] and at the [[Gwangandaegyo]] Bridge.<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /><!-- while a Korean actor was expected to be cast for the film.<ref name=\"Busan\" />--> with additional location shooting also taking place at the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"Africanews\" /> John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"MarzanoFilms\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.<ref name=\"WrightShuri\" /> Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.<ref name=\"VultureApril2017\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\n==== Editing ====\n''Black Panther'' was edited by Michael Shawver and [[Debbie Berman]], with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in ''Black Panther'' throughout the editing process for ''Homecoming'' after first seeing the character in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on ''Creed'' to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" /> During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" />\n\nAs first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> the film includes two [[post-credit scene]]s: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring [[Sebastian Stan]] reprising his role as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]].<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" /> In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]], but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesET\" /> Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of ''Civil War'') because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Wakanda in film.jpg|thumb|[[Previsualization]] (top) and completed visual effects shot of Wakanda by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (bottom)]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and [[Scanline VFX]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; Mammal Studios; [[Method Studios]]; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xii-xx}}<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> [[Previsualization]] was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xi}} Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nComparing ''Black Panther'' to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use lots of steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like [[One Central Park]] in [[Sydney]] and [[The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala|The Pearl of Africa Hotel]] in [[Kampala]], but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]], with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a {{convert|3600|km2|abbr=on}} landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on [[CAD]] models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuideBlog\" /> Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room \"proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels\" that \"pulse and ripple\". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and \"layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos\", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.<ref name=\"PerceptionCaseStudy\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Black Panther (soundtrack)}}\nAfter reading the script, composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson decided to go to Africa to do research for the film.<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /> He spent a month in Senegal, first traveling around with musician [[Baaba Maal]] on his tour,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"SongExploder\" /> and then spending several weeks working with local musicians to form the \"base\" of his score.<ref name=\"GoranssonSDCC\" /><ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> G\u00f6ransson was particularly drawn to the [[talking drum]] and the [[tambin]], or [[Fula people|Fula]] flute, to use in his character themes,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"GoranssonTIFF\" /> along with [[Brass instruments|horns]].<ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> Nate Moore compared the work G\u00f6ransson did in defining the sound of the film to the use of music by [[James Gunn]] in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' films,<ref name=\"MooreCineworld\" /> with the composer pushing Marvel out of their comfort zone.<ref name=\"Soundtracking\" />\n\n[[Kendrick Lamar]] produced the film's curated soundtrack, ''Black Panther: The Album'', along with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his \"artistic themes align with those we explore in the film\".<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of \"top-billing names\" under Top Dawg Entertainment.<ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> G\u00f6ransson collaborated with Lamar and producer [[Sounwave]] on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"AUReviewOpps\" /> Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: \"[[All the Stars]]\",<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /> \"[[King's Dead]]\",<ref name=\"KingsDead\" /> and \"[[Pray for Me (The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar song)|Pray for Me]]\".<ref name=\"PrayForMe\" /> ''Black Panther: The Album'' was released on February 9, 2018,<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018\" /> while a soundtrack of G\u00f6ransson's score was released on February 16.<ref name=\"ScoreAlbumRelease\" /> An [[extended play]] titled ''Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed'', featuring remixes of five cues from G\u00f6ransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018.

Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition.\"<ref name=\"TimeFeb2018\" /> Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, ''Black Panther'' \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said ''Black Panther'' was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's ''[[A Raisin in the Sun (1961 film)|A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"Connolly\" /> Writer and activist [[Shaun King]] found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to [[Rosa Parks]]' [[Montgomery bus boycott]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, or [[2008 United States presidential election|Barack Obama being elected president]].<ref name=\"King\" />\n\nBy contrast, James Wilt, writing for ''[[Canadian Dimension]]'', stated that \"at its core, ''Black Panther'' contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates [[respectability politics]] over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel {{em|extremely comfortable}} watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\".<ref name=\"Wilt\" /> Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\".<ref name=\"Rickford\" /> Faisal Kutty from [[Middle East Eye]] felt the film had underlying [[Islamophobic]] themes, with the only Islamic characters being a [[Boko Haram]]-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear [[hijab]].<ref name=\"MiddleEasternEye\" />\n\n[[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] Director for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]] and ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to ''Black Panther'' since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\",<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience.<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" />\n\nGil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects\".<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models.<ref name=\"GoFundMeTodayShow\" /> Scholar Marlene D.

He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of [[colonialism]] did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\".<ref name=\"Omowale\" /> Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of ''Bam! Smack! Pow!'' said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\".<ref name=\"Gonzalez\" /> Jelani Cobb, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that ''Black Panther'' is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\"<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> Writing for ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', [[Adam Serwer]] argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"''Black Panther'' does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberation\u2014to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"<ref name=\"Serwer\" />\n\n[[Patrick Gathara]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which\u2014rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"\u2014offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\"<ref name=\"Gathara\" /> Christopher Lebron, in a piece for ''[[Boston Review]]'', called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a president <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Donald Trump]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American\".<ref name=\"Lebron\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)}}\n''Black Panther'' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning three),<ref name=\"Oscars1\" /> one [[American Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"AMA18\" /> nine [[BET Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"BET\" /> one [[Billboard Music Award]],<ref name=\"Billboard nod\" /> one [[British Academy Film Award]] (won),<ref name=\"Bafa\" /> twelve [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning three),<ref name=\"CCA19\" /> three [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref name=\"GoldenGlobeNoms\" /> eight [[Grammy Award]]s (winning two),<ref name=\"GAN19\" /> seven [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]] (winning four),<ref name=\"Mtv\" /> one [[MTV Video Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"MTVVMA18\" /> sixteen [[NAACP Image Awards]] (winning ten),<ref name=\"naacp\" /> five [[E!

Its nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] were firsts for a superhero film,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /><ref name=\"GoldenGlobeSuperheroFilm\" /> while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film.<ref name=\"MCUFirstOscar\" /> ''Black Panther'' was named one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[National Board of Review]] as well as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"NationalBoardTopTen\" /><ref name=\"AFITopTen\" /> The film was the top entertainment Google search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.<ref name=\"GoogleTop2018Searches\" />\n\n==== Oscars campaign ====\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the [[91st Academy Awards]], with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new [[Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film|Best Popular Film]] award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like ''Black Panther''\" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it.<ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardDeadline\" /><ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardTHR\" /> Glenn Whipp of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's best picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters ''Black Panther'' \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if ''Black Panther'' could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> A few weeks later, Disney revealed their [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]] list, with consideration in all [[Academy Awards#Awards of Merit categories|Awards of Merit categories]], aside from [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.<ref name=\"FYCListEW\" /><ref name=\"FYCListJoBlo\" />\n\n''Black Panther'' was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].<ref name=\"Oscars2019\" /> The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" /> Feige called the best picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\".<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible.\"<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\nWith the release of ''Black Panther'', Feige said \"there are many, many stories to tell\" about the character, and that he wanted Coogler to return for any potential sequel.<ref name=\"FeigeFuture\" /> Coogler added that he wanted to see how T'Challa would grow as a king in future films, since his reign only began recently in the MCU, while in the comics, he has been king since childhood.<ref name=\"ScreenRantFeb2018\" /> In March 2018, Feige added there was \"nothing specific to reveal\" in terms of a sequel, but that there \"absolutely\" were \"ideas and a pretty solid direction on where we want to head with the second one\".<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> By October 2018, Coogler had completed a deal to write and direct a sequel to ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel\" /> On November 1, 2018, Coogler said that, while he's feeling pressure while developing the sequel due to ''Black Panther''{{'}}s success, he will \"focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning\" for the film.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel2\" /> On June 30, 2019, producer [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that work on the script had begun.<ref name=\"FeigeSequel\" /> Wright, Gurira, and Freeman will reprise their roles in the film.<ref name=\"WrightSequel\" /><ref name=\"GuriraSequel\" /><ref name=\"FreemanSequel\" /> In July 2019, Feige confirmed the film is currently in development.<ref name=\"ScreenRant\" /> The film is scheduled to be released on May 6, 2022.<ref name=\"D232019\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Afrofuturism in film]]\n* [[List of black film box office receipts]]\n* [[List of black films of the 2010s]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist |group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"CarrJun92\">{{Cite news|title=Can penguin cones be far behind?|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=June 21, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CarrAug92\">{{Cite news|title=Tolkin to sit in director's chair|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 30, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PersallAug93\">{{Cite news|title=Future is bright for Snipes|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=August 3, 1993|last=Persall|first=Steve}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BrodieJan94\">{{Cite news|title=Hollywood Pours Its Heroes into Tights|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 5, 1994|last=Brodie|first=John}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PittsMar94\">{{Cite news|title=A comics milestone from the action-filled universe of superheroes come new characters, and a new diversity|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=March 27, 1994|last=Pitts, Jr.|first=Leonard|authorlink=Leonard Pitts|page=J1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LoveceMay94\">{{Cite news|title=Off the drawing board|work=[[Newsday]]|date=May 15, 1994|last=Lovece|first=Frank}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NyeJan96\">{{Cite news|title=Stan Lee hopes New World deal pumps life into his creations|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|date=January 28, 1996|last=Nye|first=Doug}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DawesJul97\">{{Cite news|title=Action!

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 18th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Ryan Coogler]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Joe Robert Cole]], and stars <!-- Order per this source: https://news.marvel.com/movies/58647/marvel-studios-begins-production-black-panther-2/ -->[[Chadwick Boseman]] as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside [[Michael B.

In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] was hired to write a script in January 2011. ''Black Panther'' was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making ''Black Panther'' the first Marvel film with a predominantly [[Black film|black cast]]. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], and [[Busan]], South Korea.\n\n''Black Panther'' premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16. The film received praise from critics for its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, though the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3&nbsp;billion worldwide and broke numerous [[List of Black Panther box office achievements|box office records]], including the highest-grossing film by a [[Black people|black]] director. It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->highest-grossing film]] of all time, the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|third-highest-grossing film]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2018]].\n\nThe film received numerous [[List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)|awards and nominations]], with seven nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with wins for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. ''Black Panther'' is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination, and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], two wins at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and twelve nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning three), among others.<!-- Please note.

One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of [[Wakanda]]. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a [[Third World]] country. In 1992, Wakanda's King [[T'Chaka]] visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in [[Oakland, California]]. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue]] with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. \n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" />}} his son [[T'Challa]] returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice [[Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] with his recuperation.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Black Panther cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|(L:R) Producer [[Kevin Feige]], director [[Ryan Coogler]], and actors [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Michael B.

Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\".<ref name=\"CooglerVulture\" /> The film was also inspired by the comic runs of [[Jack Kirby]], [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), [[Jonathan Hickman]], and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.<ref name=\"ComingSoonSDCC\" /> The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Coogler had hoped to include [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kraven the Hunter]] early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available.<ref name=\"Kraven\" /> [[Donald Glover]] and his brother [[Stephen Glover (screenwriter)|Stephen]] made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]].<ref name=\"Glover\" /> Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was [[storyboard]]ed before being cut.<ref name=\"MooreHuffPostMay2018\" />\n\nFeige described ''Black Panther'' as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /> with ''Civil War'' laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> He also said the film would be a cross between ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\".<ref name=\"EWCoverJuly2017\" /> Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film ''[[A Prophet]]'' (2009) for inspiration.<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to [[Donald Trump]] becoming [[President of the United States]] after [[Barack Obama]], though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\"<ref name=\"EWBosemanJuly2017\" /> Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"FeigeGenreDescription\" /> ''Civil War'' did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the [[Xhosa language]], which Boseman was taught by [[John Kani]] who portrays T'Challa's father King [[T'Chaka]].<ref name=\"Xhosa\" /> Additional actors portraying Wakandans in ''Black Panther'' learned the language,<ref name=\"Nyongo/Film\" /> with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son [[Atandwa Kani|Atandwa]] served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.<ref name=\"NYTimesXhosa\" />\n\n==== Design ====\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,<ref name=\"Cole2\" /> rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\".<ref name=\"ColeAug2016\" /> Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country [[Lesotho]], a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly [[British colonization of Africa|colonized by the British]];<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /><ref name=\"LesothoVulture\" /> the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.<ref name=\"LesothoTimes\" /> Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral [[coltan]] that can almost only be found in Congo.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,<ref name=\"NoManApe\" /> and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionDesign\" />\n\n===== Sets =====\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], pulling inspiration from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Ethiopia]],<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> as well as the designs of [[Zaha Hadid]],<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic [[Mali Empire]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].<ref name=\"CooglerTimbuktu\" /> Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a [[love letter]] to Africa.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" /> Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern [[Afro-punk]] style of the Golden City, the capital.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> [[Rondavel]]s were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at [[Blyde River Canyon]] in South Africa.<ref name=\"BeachlerAug2017\" />\n\nBeachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by [[Lesotho]], the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on [[Nigerian]] writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|15}} including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the [[stainless steel]] look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the [[maglev]] and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the [[Congo peafowl]].<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" />\n\nThe majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the [[Oribi Gorge]]. The set was {{convert|36|ft}}, made up of a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|spell=in}} pool, and then {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} cliff faces that were designed to be extended to {{convert|100|ft}} with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with {{convert|25000|ft3}} of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===== Costumes =====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Masaai-women.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Dora Milaje in film.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The [[Maasai people]] of Kenya (top) inspired about 80% of the design of the [[Dora Milaje]], Wakanda's all-female special forces (bottom).<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nCostume designer [[Ruth E.

Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on [[samurai]], five percent on [[ninja]]s, and five percent on the [[Ifugao people]] from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the [[Southern Ndebele people]] and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nThe costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a [[kente cloth]] cloak with military boots.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /><ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.<ref name=\"CarterPretAReporter\" />\n\nHair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] had begun by January 21, 2017,<ref name=\"Freeman\" /><!-- Specific date source needed when available --> at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" /> under the working title ''Motherland''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"Busan\" /> Filming also took place in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the [[High Museum of Art]], which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and [[Atlanta City Hall]], which served as a United Nations building.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on ''Black Panther'' after working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'',<ref name=\"Arri\" /> first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from ''Civil War'' so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> She filmed in 3.4K [[ArriRaw]] with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]] cameras and [[Panavision]] Primo lenses,<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel [[LED]] light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an [[iPad]]. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.<ref name=\"Arri\" />\n\nShortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,<ref name=\"KanisConfirmed\" /> while on-set photographs revealed that [[Martin Freeman]] would reprise his role as [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref name=\"Freeman\" /> Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise his role as [[Ulysses Klaue]] from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWJan2017\" /><ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming.

He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.<ref name=\"ColliderJan2018\" /> Since ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in ''Infinity War''.<ref name=\"BPInfinityWar\" />\n\nAdditional filming took place in South Korea,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> with the city of [[Busan]] serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.<ref name=\"Busan\" /><ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), taking the best elements from each for ''Black Panther''{{'}}s sequence.<ref name=\"MorrisonVF\" /> Filming in Busan began on March 17,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> at the [[Jagalchi Fish Market]].<ref name=\"JagalchiFishMarket\" /> Filming moved to [[Gwangalli Beach]] on March 21,<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> with other South Korean filming locations including [[Marine City, Busan|Marine City]] in the [[Haeundae District]] and at the [[Gwangandaegyo]] Bridge.<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /> The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.<ref name=\"BusanFilming\" /> Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,<ref name=\"BusanTHR\" /><!-- while a Korean actor was expected to be cast for the film.<ref name=\"Busan\" />--> with additional location shooting also taking place at the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"Africanews\" /> John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"MarzanoFilms\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.<ref name=\"WrightShuri\" /> Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.<ref name=\"VultureApril2017\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\n==== Editing ====\n''Black Panther'' was edited by Michael Shawver and [[Debbie Berman]], with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.<ref name=\"ShawverPJ\" /> She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in ''Black Panther'' throughout the editing process for ''Homecoming'' after first seeing the character in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" /> Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on ''Creed'' to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" /> During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.<ref name=\"BermanCOW\" />\n\nAs first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,<ref name=\"CooglerFandangoJan2018\" /> the film includes two [[post-credit scene]]s: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring [[Sebastian Stan]] reprising his role as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]].<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" /> In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]], but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesET\" /> Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of ''Civil War'') because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenesRT\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Wakanda in film.jpg|thumb|[[Previsualization]] (top) and completed visual effects shot of Wakanda by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (bottom)]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and [[Scanline VFX]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; Mammal Studios; [[Method Studios]]; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xii-xx}}<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> [[Previsualization]] was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />{{rp|xi}} Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nComparing ''Black Panther'' to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.<ref name=\"NABCreativeMasters\" />\n\nILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use lots of steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like [[One Central Park]] in [[Sydney]] and [[The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala|The Pearl of Africa Hotel]] in [[Kampala]], but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]], with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a {{convert|3600|km2|abbr=on}} landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nLuma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on [[CAD]] models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuideBlog\" /> Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room \"proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels\" that \"pulse and ripple\". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and \"layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos\", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.<ref name=\"PerceptionCaseStudy\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Black Panther (soundtrack)}}\nAfter reading the script, composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson decided to go to Africa to do research for the film.<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /> He spent a month in Senegal, first traveling around with musician [[Baaba Maal]] on his tour,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"SongExploder\" /> and then spending several weeks working with local musicians to form the \"base\" of his score.<ref name=\"GoranssonSDCC\" /><ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> G\u00f6ransson was particularly drawn to the [[talking drum]] and the [[tambin]], or [[Fula people|Fula]] flute, to use in his character themes,<ref name=\"PitchforkBreakdown\" /><ref name=\"GoranssonTIFF\" /> along with [[Brass instruments|horns]].<ref name=\"GeniusVideo\" /> Nate Moore compared the work G\u00f6ransson did in defining the sound of the film to the use of music by [[James Gunn]] in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' films,<ref name=\"MooreCineworld\" /> with the composer pushing Marvel out of their comfort zone.<ref name=\"Soundtracking\" />\n\n[[Kendrick Lamar]] produced the film's curated soundtrack, ''Black Panther: The Album'', along with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his \"artistic themes align with those we explore in the film\".<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of \"top-billing names\" under Top Dawg Entertainment.<ref name=\"NPRBreakdown\" /> G\u00f6ransson collaborated with Lamar and producer [[Sounwave]] on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"AUReviewOpps\" /> Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: \"[[All the Stars]]\",<ref name=\"LamarSoundtrack\" /> \"[[King's Dead]]\",<ref name=\"KingsDead\" /> and \"[[Pray for Me (The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar song)|Pray for Me]]\".<ref name=\"PrayForMe\" /> ''Black Panther: The Album'' was released on February 9, 2018,<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018\" /> while a soundtrack of G\u00f6ransson's score was released on February 16.<ref name=\"ScoreAlbumRelease\" /> An [[extended play]] titled ''Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed'', featuring remixes of five cues from G\u00f6ransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018.

Truitt also praised the \"superb cast\" and stated, \"While the themes are deep, ''Black Panther'' is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda\".<ref name=\"USAToday_Review\" />\n\nAlso giving the film four stars, [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it unlike any other Marvel film, \"an exhilarating triumph on every level from writing, directing, acting, production design, costumes, music, special effects to you name it\".<ref name=\"RollingStone_Review\" /> Natasha Alford of ''[[The Grio]]'' called the film a \"movement, a revolution in progress, and a joy to experience all wrapped into one\", and called it \"a master class in what it means to be proud of who you are\".<ref name=\"TheGrio_Review\" /> [[Jamie Broadnax]] of Black Girl Nerds called the film a masterpiece that is \"afro-futuristic and Blackity-black as hell.

And they did.\"<ref name=\"Slate_Review\" /> Although praising the film itself and calling it a \"refreshing answer to the increasingly stale world of superhero cinema\", Devindra Hardawar at [[Engadget]] was critical of the CGI, notably the digital actors used, calling them \"weightless, ugly and, worst of all, incredibly distracting\".

Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition.\"<ref name=\"TimeFeb2018\" /> Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, ''Black Panther'' \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said ''Black Panther'' was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's ''[[A Raisin in the Sun (1961 film)|A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"Connolly\" /> Writer and activist [[Shaun King]] found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to [[Rosa Parks]]' [[Montgomery bus boycott]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, or [[2008 United States presidential election|Barack Obama being elected president]].<ref name=\"King\" />\n\nBy contrast, James Wilt, writing for ''[[Canadian Dimension]]'', stated that \"at its core, ''Black Panther'' contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates [[respectability politics]] over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel {{em|extremely comfortable}} watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\".<ref name=\"Wilt\" /> Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\".<ref name=\"Rickford\" /> Faisal Kutty from [[Middle East Eye]] felt the film had underlying [[Islamophobic]] themes, with the only Islamic characters being a [[Boko Haram]]-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear [[hijab]].<ref name=\"MiddleEasternEye\" />\n\n[[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] Director for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]] and ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.<ref name=\"BlackCaucusPanel\" /> Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to ''Black Panther'' since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\",<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience.<ref name=\"NYTimesMag\" /> She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" />\n\nGil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects\".<ref name=\"USATodayJan2018Representation\" /> Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models.<ref name=\"GoFundMeTodayShow\" /> Scholar Marlene D.

He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of [[colonialism]] did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\".<ref name=\"Omowale\" /> Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of ''Bam! Smack! Pow!'' said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\".<ref name=\"Gonzalez\" /> Jelani Cobb, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that ''Black Panther'' is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\"<ref name=\"Cobb\" /> Writing for ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', [[Adam Serwer]] argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"''Black Panther'' does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberation\u2014to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"<ref name=\"Serwer\" />\n\n[[Patrick Gathara]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which\u2014rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"\u2014offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\"<ref name=\"Gathara\" /> Christopher Lebron, in a piece for ''[[Boston Review]]'', called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a president <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Donald Trump]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American\".<ref name=\"Lebron\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)}}\n''Black Panther'' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning three),<ref name=\"Oscars1\" /> one [[American Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"AMA18\" /> nine [[BET Awards]] (winning two),<ref name=\"BET\" /> one [[Billboard Music Award]],<ref name=\"Billboard nod\" /> one [[British Academy Film Award]] (won),<ref name=\"Bafa\" /> twelve [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning three),<ref name=\"CCA19\" /> three [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref name=\"GoldenGlobeNoms\" /> eight [[Grammy Award]]s (winning two),<ref name=\"GAN19\" /> seven [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]] (winning four),<ref name=\"Mtv\" /> one [[MTV Video Music Award]] (won),<ref name=\"MTVVMA18\" /> sixteen [[NAACP Image Awards]] (winning ten),<ref name=\"naacp\" /> five [[E!

The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new [[Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film|Best Popular Film]] award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like ''Black Panther''\" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it.<ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardDeadline\" /><ref name=\"NoPopularFilmAwardTHR\" /> Glenn Whipp of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's best picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters ''Black Panther'' \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if ''Black Panther'' could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.<ref name=\"OscarsCampaignLATimes\" /> A few weeks later, Disney revealed their [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]] list, with consideration in all [[Academy Awards#Awards of Merit categories|Awards of Merit categories]], aside from [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.<ref name=\"FYCListEW\" /><ref name=\"FYCListJoBlo\" />\n\n''Black Panther'' was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].<ref name=\"Oscars2019\" /> The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" /> Feige called the best picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\".<ref name=\"OscarsBestPicture\" /> On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible.\"<ref name=\"OscarsProductionDesign\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\nWith the release of ''Black Panther'', Feige said \"there are many, many stories to tell\" about the character, and that he wanted Coogler to return for any potential sequel.<ref name=\"FeigeFuture\" /> Coogler added that he wanted to see how T'Challa would grow as a king in future films, since his reign only began recently in the MCU, while in the comics, he has been king since childhood.<ref name=\"ScreenRantFeb2018\" /> In March 2018, Feige added there was \"nothing specific to reveal\" in terms of a sequel, but that there \"absolutely\" were \"ideas and a pretty solid direction on where we want to head with the second one\".<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> By October 2018, Coogler had completed a deal to write and direct a sequel to ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel\" /> On November 1, 2018, Coogler said that, while he's feeling pressure while developing the sequel due to ''Black Panther''{{'}}s success, he will \"focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning\" for the film.<ref name=\"CooglerSequel2\" /> On June 30, 2019, producer [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that work on the script had begun.<ref name=\"FeigeSequel\" /> Wright, Gurira, and Freeman will reprise their roles in the film.<ref name=\"WrightSequel\" /><ref name=\"GuriraSequel\" /><ref name=\"FreemanSequel\" /> In July 2019, Feige confirmed the film is currently in development.<ref name=\"ScreenRant\" /> The film is scheduled to be released on May 6, 2022.<ref name=\"D232019\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Afrofuturism in film]]\n* [[List of black film box office receipts]]\n* [[List of black films of the 2010s]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist |group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"CarrJun92\">{{Cite news|title=Can penguin cones be far behind?|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=June 21, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CarrAug92\">{{Cite news|title=Tolkin to sit in director's chair|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 30, 1992|last=Carr|first=Jay}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PersallAug93\">{{Cite news|title=Future is bright for Snipes|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=August 3, 1993|last=Persall|first=Steve}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BrodieJan94\">{{Cite news|title=Hollywood Pours Its Heroes into Tights|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 5, 1994|last=Brodie|first=John}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PittsMar94\">{{Cite news|title=A comics milestone from the action-filled universe of superheroes come new characters, and a new diversity|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=March 27, 1994|last=Pitts, Jr.|first=Leonard|authorlink=Leonard Pitts|page=J1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LoveceMay94\">{{Cite news|title=Off the drawing board|work=[[Newsday]]|date=May 15, 1994|last=Lovece|first=Frank}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NyeJan96\">{{Cite news|title=Stan Lee hopes New World deal pumps life into his creations|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|date=January 28, 1996|last=Nye|first=Doug}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DawesJul97\">{{Cite news|title=Action!
