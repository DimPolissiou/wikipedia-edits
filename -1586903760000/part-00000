YIVO Encyclopedia.</ref> It was a typical [[shtetl]], a small town with a majority Jewish community coexistent with its Polish minority and surrounded by majority Polish countryside, one of many such towns in [[Second Polish Republic|prewar Poland]]. The region politically supported the right-wing [[National Democracy|National Democrats]],{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} who sought to counter what they said was Jewish economic competition against Catholic Poles, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors. Nevertheless, there were good prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town, possibly better than elsewhere in the country. At their most tense, a 1934 rumor that drew a connection between the killing of a Jewish woman and the killing of a Catholic man was quashed by a priest and a rabbi addressing the matter together, before it escalated.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=19}}\n\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by [[National Democracy]]'s far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} \n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

The region politically supported the right-wing [[National Democracy|National Democrats]],{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} who sought to counter what they said was Jewish economic competition against Catholic Poles, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors. Nevertheless, there were good prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town, possibly better than elsewhere in the country. At their most tense, a 1934 rumor that drew a connection between the killing of a Jewish woman and the killing of a Catholic man was quashed by a priest and a rabbi addressing the matter together, before it escalated.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=19}}\n\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by [[National Democracy]]'s far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} \n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children.

These established cooperation with a new town council, headed by the brother-in-law of a previous mayor, Marian Karolak. Scholars say it is likely that the Germans consented to the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]].

Even then, the few willing Polish collaborators included ''Volksdeutsche'' (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals.\"{{sfn|Michlic|Polonsky|2008}}<!--add Chodakiewicz-->\n\n[[Piotr Wr\u00f3bel]] wrote that Chodakiewicz's aim, stated in the introduction, was to show that Gross was wrong. Chodakiewicz argues that all the primary sources are wrong or worthless, including the testimony of Szmul Wassersztajn, the investigation of the 22 suspects for the 1949 trial, and the partial exhumation of the bodies. \"And yet,\" writes Wr\u00f3bel, \"Chodakiewicz is able to present his recreation of the crime. It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Wr\u00f3bel acknowledged that Chodakiewicz made some good arguments but wrote that they are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view.

According to Michlic and Polonsky, Chodakiewicz's conclusions and Stachura's review were \"very far from those reached by most historians\" who have examined the Jedwabne pogrom, including Poland's [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They wrote that Chodakiewicz and Stachura \"uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero&nbsp;...

By the end of the episode, Mr. Bushwell comes with Lewbert to tell them to leave the building. Then, Sam asks them to remember the time where they came there and changed their minds about Carly and Spencer leaving, which turns out to be a replay of the scene with Lewbert and Bushwell entering the door. Then, Bushwell lets Carly stay and Spencer (dressed up as [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] from the ''[[Back to the Future]]'' films) appears and says he knows the future regarding a \"future episode of iCarly\" about their kids (Freddie and Carly's or Freddie and Sam's).

Later, Freddie tells Sam, Carly and Gibby that he has received an e-mail from the manager of boyband [[One Direction]] (whom Gibby appears to be a massive fan of), saying that they are in the [[Seattle]] area and would like to perform a song on iCarly. When they arrive, One Direction perform \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\" in the iCarly studio. (Afterwards, Sam takes a liking to [[Zayn Malik]] while Gibby tells [[Niall Horan]] and [[Louis Tomlinson]] that he gives good foot [[massage]]s). After [[Harry Styles]] drinks from Carly's water bottle, he gets Jungle Worms from Carly and then she takes care of Harry and he is still in bed after a week, much longer than Carly was sick for, making Sam believe that Harry is not actually sick any more and just wants the attention. [[Liam Payne]] announces that the boys will have to cancel their shows in [[San Francisco]] if Harry is not better soon, so Liam, Zayn, Niall and Louis discuss with Carly, Sam and Freddie what to do to try to get Harry out of bed. Freddie says that Harry might feel better if he thought that he was being kicked out of One Direction and being replaced by Gibby, and when he sees Gibby performing with Liam, Niall, Louis and Zayn, Harry is shocked by how bad Gibby is at singing and dancing and says that he is feeling better, meaning that he ''was'' faking.

He then makes one that shoots corn at intruders, but it malfunctions and accidentally attacks Carly, Freddie and Spencer. They try to have it focus on Mrs. Benson and unplug it, but Spencer is not able to pull the plug out of the outlet before the machine runs out of corn, so Mrs. Benson is heavily pelted with corn. Meanwhile, Sam and Gibby open a secret restaurant named ''Gibby's'' in the basement at school. Bully Billy Boots harasses and annoys Gibby. Sam tries to intervene by sending Gibby to go on a walk and trying to talk to Billy, but when Gibby returns later, Billy attacks him and Sam beats up Billy with a Butter sock. The next day, Billy tells Mr. Howard about the restaurant in hopes it gets shut down.

They celebrate it halfway through the year as well creating a new holiday termed \"Halfoween\" and have a party. Carly dresses up as a life-size serving of tuna sushi, Sam dresses up with a hat with \"hand sanitizer\" on it, and Freddie dresses up as Lewbert. Once Nevel finds out, he dresses as a purple robot and give the \"iCarly's\" candy, which changes their voice and freaks out many people. Because of this, they angrily split up to find out who the purple robot is. Freddie successfully finds Nevel in the iCarly studio. He calls Carly and informs her it was Nevel, but Nevel's hench-man Ivan and Dimitri force Freddie into the robot costume. Nevel silences him and magnetically seals on the head so Freddie cannot take off the costume. Meanwhile, Sam and Carly get their real voices back, and Freddie probably does too. After Freddie is sent downstairs, he is caught by Gibby and Spencer. Still silenced Freddie is unable to tell his friends that it is him in the costume not Nevel. Subsequently he is suspended and lowered twenty times in Spencer's new game, Jerk Basket, everyone thinking that it is Nevel being punished. After Carly and Sam feel they have their revenge, they realize Nevel was right behind them, happily watching Freddie get jerked. Nevel unlocks Freddie's robot head and they find an angry Freddie. Spencer tries to apologize to him, giving him a free stuffed unicorn from the Jerk Basket, only for Freddie to throw it back at him. Nevel finally feels he has had his revenge for the\"iCarlys\" not regaining his popularity after the incident with the man in a wheelchair (at the end of iPity the Nevel). Carly pretends she feels sorry and lets Nevel stay at the party, but she makes Sam \"dangle\" him above Spencer's Jerk Basket. They finally let him fall, and he collapses in a huge pile of toys and prizes.

During an iCarly webcast while they are trying to have peace and quiet without Chuck and Chip causing trouble, Chip antagonizes everyone with loud music, making it impossible for them to continue and threatening to mess with Carly.

Gibby buys pants which caused a few problems during the show. While the gang starts dancing, Gibby's pants fall down, causing [[indecent exposure]] on camera, as he is not wearing any undergarments at the time. This incident prompts the NCC to show up.

The NCC forces them to pay $500,000 dollars or they will shut down iCarly, so Fallon blogs asking America for their spare change to help the iCarly gang get the money.

[[Liam Payne]] announces that the boys will have to cancel their shows in [[San Francisco]] if Harry is not better soon, so Liam, Zayn, Niall and Louis discuss with Carly, Sam and Freddie what to do to try to get Harry out of bed. Freddie says that Harry might feel better if he thought that he was being kicked out of One Direction and being replaced by Gibby, and when he sees Gibby performing with Liam, Niall, Louis and Zayn, Harry is shocked by how bad Gibby is at singing and dancing and says that he is feeling better, meaning that he ''was'' faking.

They celebrate it halfway through the year as well creating a new holiday termed \"Halfoween\" and have a party. Carly dresses up as a life-size serving of tuna sushi, Sam dresses up with a hat with \"hand sanitizer\" on it, and Freddie dresses up as Lewbert. Once Nevel finds out, he dresses as a purple robot and give the \"iCarly's\" candy, which changes their voice and freaks out many people. Because of this, they angrily split up to find out who the purple robot is. Freddie successfully finds Nevel in the iCarly studio. He calls Carly and informs her it was Nevel, but Nevel's hench-man Ivan and Dimitri force Freddie into the robot costume. Nevel silences him and magnetically seals on the head so Freddie cannot take off the costume. Meanwhile, Sam and Carly get their real voices back, and Freddie probably does too. After Freddie is sent downstairs, he is caught by Gibby and Spencer. Still silenced Freddie is unable to tell his friends that it is him in the costume not Nevel. Subsequently he is suspended and lowered twenty times in Spencer's new game, Jerk Basket, everyone thinking that it is Nevel being punished. After Carly and Sam feel they have their revenge, they realize Nevel was right behind them, happily watching Freddie get jerked. Nevel unlocks Freddie's robot head and they find an angry Freddie. Spencer tries to apologize to him, giving him a free stuffed unicorn from the Jerk Basket, only for Freddie to throw it back at him. Nevel finally feels he has had his revenge for the\"iCarlys\" not regaining his popularity after the incident with the man in a wheelchair (at the end of iPity the Nevel).

Carly tries to flirt with a nerdy store employee, but he is oblivious to everything she tries. She gets him to come over to her apartment, but he tries to act cool, which Carly does not like.

Meanwhile, Gibby buys a Galaxy Wars toy phaser and becomes depressed when Sam accidentally breaks it while beating up a bully for Lervin at the Groovie Smoothie. Freddie fixes it, but also modifies it into an actually working heat laser gun. During an iCarly webcast while they are trying to have peace and quiet without Chuck and Chip causing trouble, Chip antagonizes everyone with loud music, making it impossible for them to continue and threatening to mess with Carly. Downstairs, they find Spencer, who has been tied up by Chip. Gibby sets his phaser on \"Overload\", causing it to overheat. Before it explodes, Spencer throws it down the hallway where Chip is preparing a tub of super glue for another prank. The exploding phaser blows up the tub, and Chip gets thrown back by the explosion and glued to the elevator's doors.

Gibby buys pants which caused a few problems during the show. While the gang starts dancing, Gibby's pants fall down, causing [[indecent exposure]] on camera, as he is not wearing any undergarments at the time. This incident prompts the NCC to show up. People blame Fallon for the incident by saying he deliberately wanted Gibby's pants to fall. Carly and her friends do an episode of iCarly saying it was their fault and not Fallon's. The NCC forces them to pay $500,000 dollars or they will shut down iCarly, so Fallon blogs asking America for their spare change to help the iCarly gang get the money. At the end of the episode, Fallon invites the gang back on the show and shows them a big pile of money, totaling $576,094, which is more than enough to pay the fine. \n\n''Special guest stars:'' [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[Steve Higgins]], [[The Roots]] and Jeff Musial as themselves.\n\n''Special appearance by:'' [[Tina Fey]] as herself.\n\n''Guest stars'': BooG!e as T-Bo and Mary Scheer as Mrs. Benson.\n\n''Notes'': This is a special one-hour episode.

Then Freddie comes up with a plan to form a fake band to impress other girls. Upon seeing them talk with two girls, Sam offers to help them book their own gig. Then in the iCarly webcast, Sam announces Freddie's and Gibby's gig in their new band in the Groovy Smoothie and says that there is no way they are cancelling. So they decide to put on a fake fight, which nearly works as Gibby does not follow the plan exactly and accidentally knocks Freddie out for real. Meanwhile, Carly bans T-Bo from the loft after he destroys some things in her house and knocks out her date with a lemon launcher and comes over without invitation in the middle of the night to watch a movie about a Jamaican astronaut. T-Bo retaliates by banning her from the Groovy Smoothie and spraying her with a skunk. Later, T-Bo explains that he needs relief from stressful living in the Benson apartment every now and then and makes a bet with Carly - if she can handle living at the Benson apartment for at least one night, he will not come to the loft without asking and she can go back to the Groovy Smoothie. Soon, Carly has an over-healthy dinner and gets sprayed by a tick-gaser, and then Mrs. Benson holds a fire drill for everyone in the middle of the night and says that they will do another one soon. Carly then concedes to T-Bo and lets him come over whenever he wants. In exchange, T-Bo lets Carly come back to the Groovy Smoothie.

Carly is very disappointed because she's been unable to attend the last four years due to her father's overseas posting, and this is the last year she is eligible to attend. Sam convinces Freddie and Gibby to take Spencer's place, but this just upsets Carly more. Surprisingly, Colonel Shay arrives and escorts Carly to the dance after all.

{"title_page": "John de Benstede", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''Sir John de Benstede''' [[Knight Bachelor|KB]] (c.1275&nbsp;\u20131323/4) was a prominent member of the [[England|English]] royal household in the late 13th and early 14th century. He was [[Prebendary]] of [[Sandiacre]] from 3 February 1297 until, presumably, 1308, when he married. He was also [[King's Secretary]], and he served variously as [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England|keeper of the Great Seal]] and [[Wardrobe (government)|controller of the wardrobe]] (for [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]).  He also served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1305\u20131306, and as a royal judge from 1309 onwards.\n\n== In royal service ==\nOn the chancellor, [[John Langton|John de Langton]], going to [[Rome]] in reference to the action of the pope in annulling his election to the see of Ely, which the king had approved, the seal was delivered to Benstede, who almost immediately transferred it to William de Hamilton, afterwards (1305) Lord Chancellor.  We find him again mentioned as having charge of the seal during the interval which elapsed between [[William Hamilton (Lord Chancellor)|William de Hamilton]]'s appointment as Chancellor (29 December 1304) and its delivery to him (16 January 1305).{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\nIn the parliament of 1305, he was one of twenty-one English members appointed to confer with the same number of Scotch representatives concerning the best means of promoting the stability of Scotland. In the same year he was made chancellor of the exchequer.  This office he held until 20 August 1307, when [[John de Sandale]] was appointed in his place. In June 1307, he was entrusted by the Prince of Wales with the presentation of a petition from the [[Earl of Ulster]] and John and Eustace le Poer, praying that the king would assign such other justices in place of those already appointed as would redress certain grievances of which they complained. In the following year he was appointed keeper of the wardrobe, and in 1309 justice of the common pleas. \nIn 1315, he was sent to [[Northumberland]] with authority to summon the barons, knights, and men-at-arms of the northern counties to meet him to concert measures for securing the border against the incursions of the Scots, and in the following year was despatched on a mission to the court of the pope for the purpose of \u2018expediting certain arduous matters touching the realm of Scotland and the said pope,\u2019 but was recalled when he had got no further than Dover. He was assigned as one of the justices for the county of [[Hertford]] in 1317.{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\n=== Peace commission abroad ===\nIn 1318, he acted as one of the envoys empowered to treat for peace with [[Robert Bruce]], and in the following year was placed on a special commission to assess damages sustained by certain subjects of the Count of Flanders in 1307. In the same year (1319) he was sent, with the Bishop of Hereford and two other envoys, to Rome to urge on the pope the canonisation of [[Thomas de Cantilupe]], bishop of Hereford in the reign of Henry III. Between 1301 and 1303 we find him in attendance upon the king in Scotland. In 1302 the king granted him the right of holding two markets weekly and one fair yearly at his manor of Ermington in Devonshire, with other privileges, and in the following year he obtained a similar grant for his manor of Bennington, Hertfordshire. In 1306 he went the northern circuit as one of the commission of [[trailbaston]]. He was appointed justice of the common bench on the accession of Edward II (1307), the king in the same year granting him the right of fortifying his house called Rosemont at Eye, near Westminster, with walls of lime and stone. Next year he attended the king in Scotland, and was also despatched with [[Roger Savage]] to Philip of France to arrange a personal interview between the two kings, which took place at Pontoise.\n\nBetween 1311 and 1321 he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice. In 1312 we find him present on two occasions at the exchequer with the barons; but there is no reason to infer from this, with Dugdale, that he was ever regularly appointed a baron. He was probably present merely as one of the council. In 1314\u201315 he was employed in Scotland upon affairs of state, the nature of which does not very clearly appear. Fines were regularly levied before him between 1312 and 1320.  In the latter year he resigned, [[William de Hale]] being appointed to succeed him. \nIn 1322, he was returned by the sheriff as one of the inhabitants of Hertfordshire liable to military service, and summoned to render the same, being described as a banneret.  His death probably took place in 1323, as his estates are entered amongst the escheats of the seventeenth year of Edward II's reign (July 1323\u2013July 1324).{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\n=== Family ===\nHe was twice married, the name of his first wife being Isabella, and that of his second Petronilla.  At the date of his death he was possessed of estates in Devonshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Wiltshire, and Hampshire.  His wife Petronilla and a son, Edmund, thirteen years old, survived him.  Petronilla was life-tenant of a portion of the estates in right of dower. She died in 1342.

He was [[Prebendary]] of [[Sandiacre]] from 3 February 1297 until, presumably, 1308, when he married. He was also [[King's Secretary]], and he served variously as [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England|keeper of the Great Seal]] and [[Wardrobe (government)|controller of the wardrobe]] (for [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]).  He also served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1305-1306, and as a royal judge from 1309 onwards.\n\n== In royal service ==\nOn the chancellor, [[John Langton|John de Langton]], going to [[Rome]] in reference to the action of the pope in annulling his election to the see of Ely, which the king had approved, the seal was delivered to Benstede, who almost immediately transferred it to William de Hamilton, afterwards (1305) Lord Chancellor.  We find him again mentioned as having charge of the seal during the interval which elapsed between [[William Hamilton (Lord Chancellor)|William de Hamilton]]'s appointment as Chancellor (29 December 1304) and its delivery to him (16 January 1305).{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\nIn the parliament of 1305, he was one of twenty-one English members appointed to confer with the same number of Scotch representatives concerning the best means of promoting the stability of Scotland. In the same year he was made chancellor of the exchequer.  This office he held until 20 August 1307, when [[John de Sandale]] was appointed in his place. In June 1307, he was entrusted by the Prince of Wales with the presentation of a petition from the [[Earl of Ulster]] and John and Eustace le Poer, praying that the king would assign such other justices in place of those already appointed as would redress certain grievances of which they complained. In the following year he was appointed keeper of the wardrobe, and in 1309 justice of the common pleas. \nIn 1315, he was sent to [[Northumberland]] with authority to summon the barons, knights, and men-at-arms of the northern counties to meet him to concert measures for securing the border against the incursions of the Scots, and in the following year was despatched on a mission to the court of the pope for the purpose of \u2018expediting certain arduous matters touching the realm of Scotland and the said pope,\u2019 but was recalled when he had got no further than Dover. He was assigned as one of the justices for the county of [[Hertford]] in 1317.{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\n=== Peace commission abroad ===\nIn 1318, he acted as one of the envoys empowered to treat for peace with [[Robert Bruce]], and in the following year was placed on a special commission to assess damages sustained by certain subjects of the Count of Flanders in 1307. In the same year (1319) he was sent, with the Bishop of Hereford and two other envoys, to Rome to urge on the pope the canonisation of [[Thomas de Cantilupe]], bishop of Hereford in the reign of Henry III. Between 1301 and 1303 we find him in attendance upon the king in Scotland. In 1302 the king granted him the right of holding two markets weekly and one fair yearly at his manor of Ermington in Devonshire, with other privileges, and in the following year he obtained a similar grant for his manor of Bennington, Hertfordshire. In 1306 he went the northern circuit as one of the commission of [[trailbaston]]. He was appointed justice of the common bench on the accession of Edward II (1307), the king in the same year granting him the right of fortifying his house called Rosemont at Eye, near Westminster, with walls of lime and stone. Next year he attended the king in Scotland, and was also despatched with [[Roger Savage]] to Philip of France to arrange a personal interview between the two kings, which took place at Pontoise.\n\nBetween 1311 and 1321 he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice. In 1312 we find him present on two occasions at the exchequer with the barons; but there is no reason to infer from this, with Dugdale, that he was ever regularly appointed a baron. He was probably present merely as one of the council. In 1314\u201315 he was employed in Scotland upon affairs of state, the nature of which does not very clearly appear. Fines were regularly levied before him between 1312 and 1320.  In the latter year he resigned, [[William de Hale]] being appointed to succeed him. \nIn 1322, he was returned by the sheriff as one of the inhabitants of Hertfordshire liable to military service, and summoned to render the same, being described as a banneret.  His death probably took place in 1323, as his estates are entered amongst the escheats of the seventeenth year of Edward II's reign (July 1323\u2013July 1324).{{sfn|Rigg|1885}}\n\n=== Family ===\nHe was twice married, the name of his first wife being Isabella, and that of his second Petronilla.  At the date of his death he was possessed of estates in Devonshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Wiltshire, and Hampshire.  His wife Petronilla and a son, Edmund, thirteen years old, survived him.  Petronilla was life-tenant of a portion of the estates in right of dower. She died in 1342.

This season features Carly Shay ([[Miranda Cosgrove]]), Sam Puckett ([[Jennette McCurdy]]), Freddie Benson ([[Nathan Kress]]) and Gibby Gibson ([[Noah Munck]]) as their web show, ''iCarly'', is becoming more popular worldwide, with Sam and Freddie now as a confirmed couple, until the episode, \"iLove You\". [[Jerry Trainor]] co-stars as Carly's older brother Spencer, and [[Noah Munck]] co-stars as Gibby. This season had the specials \"iLost My Mind\", \"iDate Sam & Freddie\", \"iBloop 2: Electric Bloopaloo\", \"iStill Psycho, and \"iMeet the First Lady\".\n\n==Season synopsis==\nFollowing the events of \"iOMG\", where Sam kisses Freddie, she disappears for three days. Carly's knowledge of Sam's cell-phone password and the use of cell-phone-tracking software reveal that Sam has checked herself into a mental hospital. Freddie visits her to find out that she cannot handle her mixed feelings of love and hate for him. Freddie, on an iCarly webcast live from the mental institution, reveals that even though Sam likes him and is in denial about it, his feelings are important, too. He walks up to her and kisses her, symbolizing the start of a new relationship.\n\nIn the next few episodes (\"iLost My Mind\", \"iDate Sam & Freddie\", \"iCan't Take It\", and \"iLove You\"), the Sam and Freddie relationship is growing. Sam and Freddie are a couple but they keep fighting and after solving one problem, Carly ends up being their involuntary 'couple's counselor'. This starts driving Carly mad when Sam and Freddie end up going to Carly at 3:00AM for a stupid fight. Carly then ends up being dragged into a dinner date with Sam and Freddie but gets really upset when she has to sit at a table by herself. After a second fight between the two, Carly loses it and tells off the couple for being unable to work out their own problems and goes home, leaving Sam and Freddie confused.\n\nIn the next episode, Spencer is forced to lie to Mrs. Benson about Freddie's whereabouts because she does not know about his and Sam's relationship. Because Sam is in a relationship with Freddie, her previous torture monkey, her new torture monkey is Gibby. Gibby hates like how Sam treats him so he decides to consult with Mrs. Benson about Sam and Freddie's relationship. She does not approve, so she and Gibby devise a plan to break them up. The plan backfires when Carly accidentally reveals to Sam and Freddie that Gibby told Mrs. Benson about them, causing her to attack Gibby in retaliation. Because of this, he and Mrs. Benson force Carly to reveal to them that Sam sabotaged Freddie's application to a prestigious camp; which they use to make him angry at her. However, Carly stops the fight and helps Sam and Freddie make up, with the help of Gibby, who sends Mrs. Benson away having had a change of heart.\n\nIn the next episode, Carly suggests that Sam and Freddie try each other's hobbies, but when Sam visits Freddie's model train club she blows up the trains, Freddie gets kicked out. Then Sam takes Freddie to visit her Uncle Carmine and Cousin Chaz in prison, but she also makes him put ham in his pants which eventually gets him caught by security, angering Carmine and Chaz. Sam and Freddie end up deciding to break up at the end because of something Carly said that they overheard about their relationship being forced by a connection they have but their personalities are too different. The relationship ends on a relatively friendly note, with hints of rekindling should one of them work on their personality. Almost immediately after breaking up, Freddie admits to Sam for the very first time that he loves her, and she says she loves him, too; causing them to prolong their break-up for one more night together.\n\nAfter the first few episodes of this season, T-Bo moves into Freddie and Mrs. Benson's apartment in \"Bushwell Plaza\", after being evicted from \"The Groovy Smoothie\", making him Carly and Spencer's neighbor as well. Sam and Freddie help him do this by disguising him as a respectful gentleman, which initially works. However, Mrs. Benson finds out his true personality later and decides to kick him out. But after he assists her with rescuing the gang from a psycho-obsessed fan and her family, she decides to let him stay.\n\n==Development==\nIn late January 2011, while doing press for her North American [[Dancing Crazy Tour|Dancing Crazy]] concert tour, [[Miranda Cosgrove]] began telling news sources that she was looking forward to returning to Hollywood to begin filming a 5th season of ''iCarly''.<ref name=\"Cleveland Live News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/01/miranda_cosgrove_of_icarly_is.html|title=Miranda Cosgrove of 'iCarly' is headed to Cleveland|accessdate=February 14, 2011|work= Cleveland Live News}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters.com 1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/28/us-mirandacosgrove-idUSTRE70R8ZT20110128|title=Miranda Cosgrove Taps Rivers Cuomo for \"High Maintenance\" EP|accessdate=February 14, 2011|agency=Reuters|date=January 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"The Middletown Press\">{{cite web|url=http://www.middletownpress.com/articles/2011/02/03/entertainment/doc4d4a17dc591f2129594318.txt?viewmode=fullstory|title=iCarly's Miranda Cosgrove to perform in Connecticut|access-date=February 14, 2011|work=The Middletown Press|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215060909/http://www.middletownpress.com/articles/2011/02/03/entertainment/doc4d4a17dc591f2129594318.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archive-date=February 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On January 27, 2011, Cosgrove told Cleveland Live News \"We're getting ready to start the next season, right after the tour.

This season features Carly Shay ([[Miranda Cosgrove]]), Sam Puckett ([[Jennette McCurdy]]), Freddie Benson ([[Nathan Kress]]) and Gibby Gibson ([[Noah Munck]]) as their web show, ''iCarly'', is becoming more popular worldwide, with Sam and Freddie now as a confirmed couple, until the episode, \"iLove You\". [[Jerry Trainor]] co-stars as Carly's older brother Spencer, and [[Noah Munck]] co-stars as Gibby. This season had the specials \"iLost My Mind\", \"iDate Sam & Freddie\", \"iBloop 2: Electric Bloopaloo\", \"iStill Psycho, and \"iMeet the First Lady\".\n\n==Season synopsis==\nFollowing the events of \"iOMG\", where Sam kisses Freddie, she disappears for three days. Carly's knowledge of Sam's cell-phone password and the use of cell-phone-tracking software reveal that Sam has checked herself into a mental hospital. Freddie visits her to find out that she cannot handle her mixed feelings of love and hate for him. Freddie, on an iCarly webcast live from the mental institution, reveals that even though Sam likes him and is in denial about it, his feelings are important, too. He walks up to her and kisses her, symbolizing the start of a new relationship.\n\nIn the next few episodes (\"iLost My Mind\", \"iDate Sam & Freddie\", \"iCan't Take It\", and \"iLove You\"), the Sam and Freddie relationship is growing. Sam and Freddie are a couple but they keep fighting and after solving one problem, Carly ends up being their involuntary 'couple's counselor'. This starts driving Carly mad when Sam and Freddie end up going to Carly at 3:00AM for a stupid fight. Carly then ends up being dragged into a dinner date with Sam and Freddie but gets really upset when she has to sit at a table by herself. After a second fight between the two, Carly loses it and tells off the couple for being unable to work out their own problems and goes home, leaving Sam and Freddie confused.\n\nIn the next episode, Spencer is forced to lie to Mrs. Benson about Freddie's whereabouts because she does not know about his and Sam's relationship. Because Sam is in a relationship with Freddie, her previous torture monkey, her new torture monkey is Gibby. Gibby hates like how Sam treats him so he decides to consult with Mrs. Benson about Sam and Freddie's relationship. She does not approve, so she and Gibby devise a plan to break them up. The plan backfires when Carly accidentally reveals to Sam and Freddie that Gibby told Mrs. Benson about them, causing her to attack Gibby in retaliation. Because of this, he and Mrs. Benson force Carly to reveal to them that Sam sabotaged Freddie's application to a prestigious camp; which they use to make him angry at her. However, Carly stops the fight and helps Sam and Freddie make up, with the help of Gibby, who sends Mrs. Benson away having had a change of heart.\n\nIn the next episode, Carly suggests that Sam and Freddie try each other's hobbies, but when Sam visits Freddie's model train club she blows up the trains, Freddie gets kicked out. Then Sam takes Freddie to visit her Uncle Carmine and Cousin Chaz in prison, but she also makes him put ham in his pants which eventually gets him caught by security, angering Carmine and Chaz. Sam and Freddie end up deciding to break up at the end because of something Carly said that they overheard about their relationship being forced by a connection they have but their personalities are too different. The relationship ends on a relatively friendly note, with hints of rekindling should one of them work on their personality. Almost immediately after breaking up, Freddie admits to Sam for the very first time that he loves her, and she says she loves him, too; causing them to prolong their break-up for one more night together.\n\nAfter the first few episodes of this season, T-Bo moves into Freddie and Mrs. Benson's apartment in \"Bushwell Plaza\", after being evicted from \"The Groovy Smoothie\", making him Carly and Spencer's neighbor as well. Sam and Freddie help him do this by disguising him as a respectful gentleman, which initially works. However, Mrs. Benson finds out his true personality later and decides to kick him out. But after he assists her with rescuing the gang from a psycho-obsessed fan and her family, she decides to let him stay.\n\n==Development==\nIn late January 2011, while doing press for her North American [[Dancing Crazy Tour|Dancing Crazy]] concert tour, [[Miranda Cosgrove]] began telling news sources that she was looking forward to returning to Hollywood to begin filming a 5th season of ''iCarly''.<ref name=\"Cleveland Live News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/01/miranda_cosgrove_of_icarly_is.html|title=Miranda Cosgrove of 'iCarly' is headed to Cleveland|accessdate=February 14, 2011|work= Cleveland Live News}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters.com 1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/28/us-mirandacosgrove-idUSTRE70R8ZT20110128|title=Miranda Cosgrove Taps Rivers Cuomo for \"High Maintenance\" EP|accessdate=February 14, 2011|agency=Reuters|date=January 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"The Middletown Press\">{{cite web|url=http://www.middletownpress.com/articles/2011/02/03/entertainment/doc4d4a17dc591f2129594318.txt?viewmode=fullstory|title=iCarly's Miranda Cosgrove to perform in Connecticut|access-date=February 14, 2011|work=The Middletown Press|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215060909/http://www.middletownpress.com/articles/2011/02/03/entertainment/doc4d4a17dc591f2129594318.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archive-date=February 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On January 27, 2011, Cosgrove told Cleveland Live News \"We're getting ready to start the next season, right after the tour.
