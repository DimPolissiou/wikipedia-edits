These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.musseles are cams or just cam if its one.Ir it could be clams.\n\n\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family [[Mytilidae]], most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong [[Byssus|byssal threads]] (\"beard\") to a firm substrate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/mussel|title=Mussel|last=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=22 May 2009|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref> A few species (in the genus ''[[Bathymodiolus]]'') have colonised [[hydrothermal vent]]s associated with deep ocean ridges.\n\nIn most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat [[nacre]]ous.\n\nThe common name \"mussel\" is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]s. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and they are classified in a different [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of bivalves, despite some very superficial similarities in appearance.\n\nFreshwater [[zebra mussels]] and their relatives in the family [[Dreissenidae]] are not related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many ''Mytilus'' species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the [[Heterodonta]], the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as \"clams\".\n\n==General anatomy==\n[[File:Miesmuscheln-2.jpg|thumb|left| Marine [[blue mussel]], ''Mytilus edulis'', showing some of the inner anatomy. The white posterior adductor muscle is visible in the upper image, and has been cut in the lower image to allow the valves to open fully.]]\n[[File:3D flight around a \u00b5CT scan of a Mytilus covered with Balanidae.ogv|thumb|300px|right|Flight around a 3D-[[3D rendering|Rendering]] of a [[Computed tomography|\u00b5CT]]-Scan of a young [[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]] that is almost completely covered with [[Balanidae]] (barnacles). Resolution of the scan is 29\u00b5m/[[Voxel]].]]\n\nThe mussel's external shell is composed of two hinged halves or \"valves\". The valves are joined together on the outside by a ligament, and are closed when necessary by strong internal muscles (anterior and posterior adductor muscles). Mussel shells carry out a variety of functions, including support for soft tissues, protection from predators and protection against desiccation.\n\n\nThe shell has three layers. In the pearly mussels there is an inner iridescent layer of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl) composed of [[calcium carbonate]], which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the [[periostracum]], an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called [[conchin]], and its function is to protect the prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).\n\nLike most bivalves, mussels have a large organ called a foot. In freshwater mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling the rest of the animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.\n\nIn marine mussels, the foot is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is continuous with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate allowing it to remain [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] in areas of high flow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Eleonora|last2=Waite|first2=J. Herbert|date=2001-09-01|title=Yield and Post-Yield Behavior of Mussel Byssal Thread: A Self-Healing Biomolecular Material|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=2|issue=3|pages=906\u2013911|doi=10.1021/bm0100514|issn=1525-7797}}</ref> The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as [[dog whelk]]s, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.\n\nIn cooking, the byssus of the mussel is known as the \"beard\" and is removed before the mussels are prepared.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life habits==\n[[File:Mytilus with byssus.jpg|thumb|left| A ''Mytilus'' with its byssus clearly showing, at [[Ocean Beach, San Francisco, California|Ocean Beach]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]]]\n[[File:Starfishmussel.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sea star|starfish]] consuming a mussel in [[Northern California]]]]\n\n===Feeding===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[filter feeders]]; they feed on [[plankton]] and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then brought into the branchial chamber by the actions of the [[cilia]] located on the [[gill]]s for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.\n\nMarine mussels are usually found [[Sessility (zoology)|clumping]] together on wave-washed rocks, each attached to the rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against the force of the waves. At low tide mussels in the middle of a clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.\n\n===Reproduction===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]], with separate male and female individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, it is capable of moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.\n\nFreshwater mussels reproduce sexually. Sperm is released by the male directly into the water and enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a [[glochidium]] (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of [[aggressive mimicry]].\n\nGlochidia are generally species-specific, and will only live if they find the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach to the fish, the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a [[cyst]], where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop to the bottom of the water to begin an independent life.\n\n===Predators===\nMarine mussels are eaten by humans, [[starfish]], seabirds, and by numerous species of [[predatory]] marine [[gastropod]]s in the family [[Muricidae]], such as the [[dog whelk]], ''Nucella lapillus''. Freshwater mussels are eaten by muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and geese. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Mussels on rock.JPG|thumb|160px|Mussels completely covering rocks in [[intertidal zone]], in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]]]\nMarine mussels are abundant in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, but not in the same huge numbers as in temperate zones.\n\nCertain species of marine mussels prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in pounding surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near [[hydrothermal vents]]. The South African white mussel exceptionally does not bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion of food and water and exhausting wastes.\n\nFreshwater mussels inhabit permanent lakes, rivers, canals and streams throughout the world except in the polar regions. They require a constant source of cool, clean water. They prefer water with a substantial mineral content, using calcium carbonate to build their shells.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aquaculture==\n[[File:Mussel dredgers at Carlingford harbour - geograph.org.uk - 174327.jpg|thumb|right|Mussel [[Fishing dredge|dredgers]]]]\n[[File:Bouchots DSC04101.jpg|thumb|75px|right|''Bouchots'' are marine pilings for growing mussels, here shown at an agricultural fair.]]\n[[File:Abucay,Bataanjf3721 06.JPG|thumb|right|125px|[[Bamboo]] is used for mussel breeding and propagation ([[Abucay, Bataan]], [[Philippines]]).]]\nIn 2005, China accounted for 40% of the global mussel catch according to a [[FAO]] study.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/SQServlet?file=/usr/local/tomcat/FI/5.5.23/figis/webapps/figis/temp/hqp_30371.xml&outtype=html China catches 0.77m tonnes of mussels in 2005]</ref> Within Europe, where mussels have been cultivated for centuries, Spain remained the industry leader.

Some species of marine mussel, including the [[Blue mussel]] (''Mytilus edulis'') and the [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel]] (''Perna canaliculus''), are also cultivated as a source of food.\n\nIn some areas of the world, mussel farmers collect naturally occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed.<ref name=\"BC\" /> Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm.<ref name=\"BC\" /> The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is \"socked\" (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use byssus threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.\n\nThere are a variety of techniques for growing mussels.\n\n* '''Bouchot culture:''' Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, known in French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which the mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting prevents the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.\n* '''On-bottom culture:''' On-bottom culture is based on the principle of transferring mussel seed (spat) from areas where they have settled naturally to areas where they can be placed in lower densities to increase growth rates, facilitate harvest, and control predation (Mussel farmers must remove predators and macroalgae during the growth cycle).<ref name=\"Mytilus\">{{cite web|title=Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme, Mytilus edulis|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Mytilus_edulis/en|publisher=FAO}}</ref>\n* '''Raft culture:''' Raft culture is a commonly used method throughout the world. Lines of rope mesh socks are seeded with young mussels and suspended vertically from a raft. The specific length of the socks depends on depth and food availability.\n* '''Longline culture (rope culture):''' Mussels are cultivated extensively in New Zealand, where the most common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture<ref name=\"Mytilus\" /> and are often used as an alternative to raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.\n\n===Harvest===\nIn roughly 12\u201315 months, mussels reach marketable size (40mm) and are ready for harvest. Harvesting methods depend on the grow-out area and the rearing method being used. Dredges are currently used for on-bottom culture. Mussels grown on wooden poles can be harvested by hand or with a hydraulic powered system. For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought to the surface and dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay3.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning mussels in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\n\n==Medical==\nByssal threads, used to anchor mussels to substrates, are now recognized as superior bonding agents.

In the USA during the Second World War, mussels were commonly served in diners and eateries across the country. This was due to the lack of access to red meat (such as beef and pork) for the general public, in relation to the aspect of the American [[wartime rationing]] policy concerning food, with much of the meat available being sent to aid the US military's war efforts abroad. Instead, mussels became a popular substitute for most meats (with the exception of chicken).<ref>Alton Brown, ''Good Eats,''</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, mussels are consumed with [[French fries]] (\"mosselen met friet\" or \"[[moules-frites]]\") or bread. In Belgium, mussels are sometimes served with fresh herbs and flavorful vegetables in a stock of butter and white wine. [[French fries|Fries]] and [[Belgian beer]] sometimes are accompaniments. In the Netherlands, mussels are sometimes served fried in batter or [[breading|breadcrumbs]], particularly at [[take-out]] food outlets or informal settings. In France, the [[\u00c9clade des Moules#Charente-Maritime|\u00c9clade des Moules]], or, locally, Terr\u00e9 de Moules, is a mussel bake that can be found along the beaches of the [[Bay of Biscay]].\n\nIn Italy, mussels are mixed with other sea food, they are consumed often steam cooked (most popular), sometimes with white wine, herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. In Spain, they are consumed mostly steam cooked, sometimes boiling white wine, onion and herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. They can also be eaten as \"tigres\", a sort of [[croquette]] using the mussel meat, shrimps and other pieces of fish in a thick bechamel then breaded and fried in the clean mussel shell. They are used in other sort of dishes such as rices or soups or commonly eaten canned in a [[pickling]] brine made of oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay leaves and paprika.\n\nIn Turkey, mussels are either covered with flour and fried on shishs ('midye tava'), or filled with rice and served cold ('midye dolma') and are usually consumed after alcohol (mostly [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|raki]] or beer).\n\nThey are used in Ireland boiled and seasoned with vinegar, with the \"bray\" or boiling water as a supplementary hot drink.\n\nIn [[Cantonese cuisine]], mussels are cooked in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean. In New Zealand, they are served in a chilli or garlic-based [[vinaigrette]], processed into fritters and fried, or used as the base for a chowder.\n\nIn Brasil, it is common to see mussels being cooked and served with olive oil, usually accompanied by onion, garlic and other herbs. The plate is very popular among tourists and low classes, probably because of the hot climate that favours mussels reproduction.\n\nIn India, mussels are popular in [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]]-[[Bhatkal]], and [[Goa]]. They are either prepared with [[Moringa oleifera|drumsticks]], [[breadfruit]] or other vegetables, or filled with rice and coconut paste with spices and served hot. Fried mussels ('Kadukka' \u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 in [[Malayalam]]) of north Kerala especially in [[Thalassery]] are a spicy, favored delicacy.\nIn coastal [[Karnataka]] [[Beary]]'s prepare special rice ball stuffed with spicy fried mussels and steamed  locally known  as \"pachilede pindi\".\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Moules frites wth rose and pastis.JPG|thumb|300px|Moules frites]]\n[[File:Mussel dish.jpg|thumb|A mussel dish with cherry tomatoes and croutons]]\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay1.jpg|thumb|right|Simple mussels roasting in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\nMussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried in butter or vegetable oil. As with all [[shellfish]], except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002851|Poisoning - fish and shellfish}}</ref> A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of \"the beard\" is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were \"both adequately cooked and safe to eat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm |title=Mussel myth an open and shut case |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2015-08-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough mussels are valued as food, mussel poisoning due to toxic planktonic organisms can be a danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided along the west coast of the United States during the warmer months. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of [[dinoflagellate]]s (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel's filter feeding, but if the mussels are consumed by humans, the concentrated toxins cause serious illness, such as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]]. A person affected in this way after eating mussels is said to be ''musselled''.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'': mussel (verb).</ref>\n\n===Nutrition highlights===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Raw [[blue mussel]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calorieking.com/foods/calories-in-shellfish-fresh-mussel-blue-raw_f-Y2lkPTM5MjQzJmJpZD0xJmZpZD02MjM1NiZlaWQ9MzU3ODkwMTc2JnBvcz0yJnBhcj0ma2V5PW11c3NlbA.html |title=Calories in Mussel, raw &#124; Nutrition, Carbohydrate and Calorie Counter |publisher=Calorieking.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| Serving size || 3 ounces (85 g)\n|-\n| [[Food energy|Calories]] || 70\n|-\n| [[Protein]] || 10.1 g\n|-\n| [[Carbohydrate]] || 3.1 g\n|-\n| [[Dietary fiber|Fiber]] || 0.0 g\n|-\n| Total [[fat]] || 1.9 g\n|-\n| [[Saturated fat]] || 0.4 g\n|-\n| [[Sodium]] || 243&nbsp;mg\n|}\n\n*Excellent source of: [[selenium]] (44.8&nbsp;\u00b5g), and [[vitamin B12]] (12&nbsp;\u00b5g)\n*Good source of: [[zinc]] (1.6&nbsp;mg), and [[folate]] (42&nbsp;\u00b5g)<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Nutrition Info and calories in Raw Blue Mussels |url=http://recipeofhealth.com/nutrition-calories/mussel-blue-3746rb}}</ref>\n\nFoods that are an \"excellent source\" of a particular nutrient provide 20% or more of the [[recommended daily value]].

These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family [[Mytilidae]], most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong [[Byssus|byssal threads]] (\"beard\") to a firm substrate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/mussel|title=Mussel|last=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=22 May 2009|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref> A few species (in the genus ''[[Bathymodiolus]]'') have colonised [[hydrothermal vent]]s associated with deep ocean ridges.\n\nIn most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat [[nacre]]ous.\n\nThe common name \"mussel\" is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]s. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and they are classified in a different [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of bivalves, despite some very superficial similarities in appearance.\n\nFreshwater [[zebra mussels]] and their relatives in the family [[Dreissenidae]] are not related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many ''Mytilus'' species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the [[Heterodonta]], the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as \"clams\".\n\n==General anatomy==\n[[File:Miesmuscheln-2.jpg|thumb|left| Marine [[blue mussel]], ''Mytilus edulis'', showing some of the inner anatomy. The white posterior adductor muscle is visible in the upper image, and has been cut in the lower image to allow the valves to open fully.]]\n[[File:3D flight around a \u00b5CT scan of a Mytilus covered with Balanidae.ogv|thumb|300px|right|Flight around a 3D-[[3D rendering|Rendering]] of a [[Computed tomography|\u00b5CT]]-Scan of a young [[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]] that is almost completely covered with [[Balanidae]] (barnacles). Resolution of the scan is 29\u00b5m/[[Voxel]].]]\n\nThe mussel's external shell is composed of two hinged halves or \"valves\". The valves are joined together on the outside by a ligament, and are closed when necessary by strong internal muscles (anterior and posterior adductor muscles). Mussel shells carry out a variety of functions, including support for soft tissues, protection from predators and protection against desiccation.\n\n\nThe shell has three layers. In the pearly mussels there is an inner iridescent layer of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl) composed of [[calcium carbonate]], which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the [[periostracum]], an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called [[conchin]], and its function is to protect the prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).\n\nLike most bivalves, mussels have a large organ called a foot. In freshwater mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling the rest of the animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.\n\nIn marine mussels, the foot is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is continuous with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate allowing it to remain [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] in areas of high flow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Eleonora|last2=Waite|first2=J. Herbert|date=2001-09-01|title=Yield and Post-Yield Behavior of Mussel Byssal Thread: A Self-Healing Biomolecular Material|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=2|issue=3|pages=906\u2013911|doi=10.1021/bm0100514|issn=1525-7797}}</ref> The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as [[dog whelk]]s, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.\n\nIn cooking, the byssus of the mussel is known as the \"beard\" and is removed before the mussels are prepared.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life habits==\n[[File:Mytilus with byssus.jpg|thumb|left| A ''Mytilus'' with its byssus clearly showing, at [[Ocean Beach, San Francisco, California|Ocean Beach]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]]]\n[[File:Starfishmussel.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sea star|starfish]] consuming a mussel in [[Northern California]]]]\n\n===Feeding===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[filter feeders]]; they feed on [[plankton]] and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then brought into the branchial chamber by the actions of the [[cilia]] located on the [[gill]]s for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.\n\nMarine mussels are usually found [[Sessility (zoology)|clumping]] together on wave-washed rocks, each attached to the rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against the force of the waves. At low tide mussels in the middle of a clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.\n\n===Reproduction===\nBoth marine and freshwater mussels are [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]], with separate male and female individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, it is capable of moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.\n\nFreshwater mussels reproduce sexually. Sperm is released by the male directly into the water and enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a [[glochidium]] (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of [[aggressive mimicry]].\n\nGlochidia are generally species-specific, and will only live if they find the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach to the fish, the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a [[cyst]], where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop to the bottom of the water to begin an independent life.\n\n===Predators===\nMarine mussels are eaten by humans, [[starfish]], seabirds, and by numerous species of [[predatory]] marine [[gastropod]]s in the family [[Muricidae]], such as the [[dog whelk]], ''Nucella lapillus''. Freshwater mussels are eaten by muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and geese. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Mussels on rock.JPG|thumb|160px|Mussels completely covering rocks in [[intertidal zone]], in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]]]\nMarine mussels are abundant in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, but not in the same huge numbers as in temperate zones.\n\nCertain species of marine mussels prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in pounding surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near [[hydrothermal vents]]. The South African white mussel exceptionally does not bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion of food and water and exhausting wastes.\n\nFreshwater mussels inhabit permanent lakes, rivers, canals and streams throughout the world except in the polar regions. They require a constant source of cool, clean water. They prefer water with a substantial mineral content, using calcium carbonate to build their shells.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aquaculture==\n[[File:Mussel dredgers at Carlingford harbour - geograph.org.uk - 174327.jpg|thumb|right|Mussel [[Fishing dredge|dredgers]]]]\n[[File:Bouchots DSC04101.jpg|thumb|75px|right|''Bouchots'' are marine pilings for growing mussels, here shown at an agricultural fair.]]\n[[File:Abucay,Bataanjf3721 06.JPG|thumb|right|125px|[[Bamboo]] is used for mussel breeding and propagation ([[Abucay, Bataan]], [[Philippines]]).]]\nIn 2005, China accounted for 40% of the global mussel catch according to a [[FAO]] study.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/SQServlet?file=/usr/local/tomcat/FI/5.5.23/figis/webapps/figis/temp/hqp_30371.xml&outtype=html China catches 0.77m tonnes of mussels in 2005]</ref> Within Europe, where mussels have been cultivated for centuries, Spain remained the industry leader.

Some species of marine mussel, including the [[Blue mussel]] (''Mytilus edulis'') and the [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel]] (''Perna canaliculus''), are also cultivated as a source of food.\n\nIn some areas of the world, mussel farmers collect naturally occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed.<ref name=\"BC\" /> Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm.<ref name=\"BC\" /> The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is \"socked\" (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use byssus threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.\n\nThere are a variety of techniques for growing mussels.\n\n* '''Bouchot culture:''' Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, known in French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which the mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting prevents the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.\n* '''On-bottom culture:''' On-bottom culture is based on the principle of transferring mussel seed (spat) from areas where they have settled naturally to areas where they can be placed in lower densities to increase growth rates, facilitate harvest, and control predation (Mussel farmers must remove predators and macroalgae during the growth cycle).<ref name=\"Mytilus\">{{cite web|title=Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme, Mytilus edulis|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Mytilus_edulis/en|publisher=FAO}}</ref>\n* '''Raft culture:''' Raft culture is a commonly used method throughout the world. Lines of rope mesh socks are seeded with young mussels and suspended vertically from a raft. The specific length of the socks depends on depth and food availability.\n* '''Longline culture (rope culture):''' Mussels are cultivated extensively in New Zealand, where the most common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture<ref name=\"Mytilus\" /> and are often used as an alternative to raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.\n\n===Harvest===\nIn roughly 12\u201315 months, mussels reach marketable size (40mm) and are ready for harvest. Harvesting methods depend on the grow-out area and the rearing method being used. Dredges are currently used for on-bottom culture. Mussels grown on wooden poles can be harvested by hand or with a hydraulic powered system. For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought to the surface and dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay3.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning mussels in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\n\n==Medical==\nByssal threads, used to anchor mussels to substrates, are now recognized as superior bonding agents.

In the USA during the Second World War, mussels were commonly served in diners and eateries across the country. This was due to the lack of access to red meat (such as beef and pork) for the general public, in relation to the aspect of the American [[wartime rationing]] policy concerning food, with much of the meat available being sent to aid the US military's war efforts abroad. Instead, mussels became a popular substitute for most meats (with the exception of chicken).<ref>Alton Brown, ''Good Eats,''</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, mussels are consumed with [[French fries]] (\"mosselen met friet\" or \"[[moules-frites]]\") or bread. In Belgium, mussels are sometimes served with fresh herbs and flavorful vegetables in a stock of butter and white wine. [[French fries|Fries]] and [[Belgian beer]] sometimes are accompaniments. In the Netherlands, mussels are sometimes served fried in batter or [[breading|breadcrumbs]], particularly at [[take-out]] food outlets or informal settings. In France, the [[\u00c9clade des Moules#Charente-Maritime|\u00c9clade des Moules]], or, locally, Terr\u00e9 de Moules, is a mussel bake that can be found along the beaches of the [[Bay of Biscay]].\n\nIn Italy, mussels are mixed with other sea food, they are consumed often steam cooked (most popular), sometimes with white wine, herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. In Spain, they are consumed mostly steam cooked, sometimes boiling white wine, onion and herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. They can also be eaten as \"tigres\", a sort of [[croquette]] using the mussel meat, shrimps and other pieces of fish in a thick bechamel then breaded and fried in the clean mussel shell. They are used in other sort of dishes such as rices or soups or commonly eaten canned in a [[pickling]] brine made of oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay leaves and paprika.\n\nIn Turkey, mussels are either covered with flour and fried on shishs ('midye tava'), or filled with rice and served cold ('midye dolma') and are usually consumed after alcohol (mostly [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|raki]] or beer).\n\nThey are used in Ireland boiled and seasoned with vinegar, with the \"bray\" or boiling water as a supplementary hot drink.\n\nIn [[Cantonese cuisine]], mussels are cooked in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean. In New Zealand, they are served in a chilli or garlic-based [[vinaigrette]], processed into fritters and fried, or used as the base for a chowder.\n\nIn Brasil, it is common to see mussels being cooked and served with olive oil, usually accompanied by onion, garlic and other herbs. The plate is very popular among tourists and low classes, probably because of the hot climate that favours mussels reproduction.\n\nIn India, mussels are popular in [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]]-[[Bhatkal]], and [[Goa]]. They are either prepared with [[Moringa oleifera|drumsticks]], [[breadfruit]] or other vegetables, or filled with rice and coconut paste with spices and served hot. Fried mussels ('Kadukka' \u0d15\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 in [[Malayalam]]) of north Kerala especially in [[Thalassery]] are a spicy, favored delicacy.\nIn coastal [[Karnataka]] [[Beary]]'s prepare special rice ball stuffed with spicy fried mussels and steamed  locally known  as \"pachilede pindi\".\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Moules frites wth rose and pastis.JPG|thumb|300px|Moules frites]]\n[[File:Mussel dish.jpg|thumb|A mussel dish with cherry tomatoes and croutons]]\n[[File:MusselsKotorBay1.jpg|thumb|right|Simple mussels roasting in a mussel farm ([[Bay of Kotor]], [[Montenegro]]).]]\nMussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried in butter or vegetable oil. As with all [[shellfish]], except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002851|Poisoning - fish and shellfish}}</ref> A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of \"the beard\" is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were \"both adequately cooked and safe to eat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm |title=Mussel myth an open and shut case |publisher=ABC Science |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2015-08-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough mussels are valued as food, mussel poisoning due to toxic planktonic organisms can be a danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided along the west coast of the United States during the warmer months. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of [[dinoflagellate]]s (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel's filter feeding, but if the mussels are consumed by humans, the concentrated toxins cause serious illness, such as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]]. A person affected in this way after eating mussels is said to be ''musselled''.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'': mussel (verb).</ref>\n\n===Nutrition highlights===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Raw [[blue mussel]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calorieking.com/foods/calories-in-shellfish-fresh-mussel-blue-raw_f-Y2lkPTM5MjQzJmJpZD0xJmZpZD02MjM1NiZlaWQ9MzU3ODkwMTc2JnBvcz0yJnBhcj0ma2V5PW11c3NlbA.html |title=Calories in Mussel, raw &#124; Nutrition, Carbohydrate and Calorie Counter |publisher=Calorieking.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>\n|-\n| Serving size || 3 ounces (85 g)\n|-\n| [[Food energy|Calories]] || 70\n|-\n| [[Protein]] || 10.1 g\n|-\n| [[Carbohydrate]] || 3.1 g\n|-\n| [[Dietary fiber|Fiber]] || 0.0 g\n|-\n| Total [[fat]] || 1.9 g\n|-\n| [[Saturated fat]] || 0.4 g\n|-\n| [[Sodium]] || 243&nbsp;mg\n|}\n\n*Excellent source of: [[selenium]] (44.8&nbsp;\u00b5g), and [[vitamin B12]] (12&nbsp;\u00b5g)\n*Good source of: [[zinc]] (1.6&nbsp;mg), and [[folate]] (42&nbsp;\u00b5g)<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Nutrition Info and calories in Raw Blue Mussels |url=http://recipeofhealth.com/nutrition-calories/mussel-blue-3746rb}}</ref>\n\nFoods that are an \"excellent source\" of a particular nutrient provide 20% or more of the [[recommended daily value]].

Both families grew and intermarried, forming the basis of the early Pakeha settler community. At one point, the Church Missionary Society decided that either Puckey or Matthews should move to a new location to the south to facilitate the spread of the word, but [[N\u014dpera Panakareao]] wrote a heartfelt letter to the CMS committee, pleading not to take away 'one of the two candlesticks'.\n\nIn February 1841, about 500 Maori were present at a CMS service.<ref>{{cite web |first = Joseph | last = Matthews|title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, August 1841 |work=A Church Mission in New Zealand|accessdate=9 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1841_05/2| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> In 1852 arguments developed between one chief and his tribe, however the impact of the missionaries meant that the old ways of settling disputes had passed.<ref name=\"Oct1853\">{{cite web |first   =| last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, October 1853|work= Kaitaia|accessdate=18 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1853_10/2| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nRichard Matthews, the brother of Rev.

[[Ahipara|Ahipara Bay]], the southern end of [[Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand|Ninety Mile Beach]], is 5&nbsp;km west.\n\nThe main industries are [[forestry]] and [[tourism]]. The population is 4,887 (2013 census), which makes it second-largest town in the Far North District, after [[Kerikeri]].\n\nThe name Kaitaia means ample food, kai being the [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] word for food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaitaia.co.nz/OurTown.cfm |title=Welcome... |accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muriwhenua]] are a group of six northern [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[iwi]] occupying the northernmost part of the [[North Island]] surrounding Kaitaia.\n\n==History and culture==\n\n===European settlement===\n\nThe Kaitaia Mission Station was established between 1833 and 1834 after a series of visits by [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) representatives including Samuel Marsden, and at different times, Joseph Matthews and [[William Gilbert Puckey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/scripts/reports/reports/45/E80B81B9-53B5-44F2-A510-67A4B120F065.pdf |format=PDF|title=Muriwhenua Land Report - The People and the Land|chapter=|page=48 |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> Puckey and Matthews had married two sisters, Matilda and Mary Ann Davis respectively, (daughters of Richard Davis, a lay missioner based at [[Waimate North|Waimate]]). They formed a tight band, initially living together in raupo huts, and then in houses they built.\n\nAs Puckey and the sisters were fluent in Maori, (Puckey having arrived in New Zealand in 1819 with his father, William Puckey, and the Davis family in 1823), they spoke Maori when together, to help Joseph pick up the language. Both families grew and intermarried, forming the basis of the early Pakeha settler community. At one point, the Church Missionary Society decided that either Puckey or Matthews should move to a new location to the south to facilitate the spread of the word, but [[N\u014dpera Panakareao]] wrote a heartfelt letter to the CMS committee, pleading not to take away 'one of the two candlesticks'.\n\nIn February 1841, about 500 Maori were present at a CMS service.<ref>{{cite web |first = Joseph | last = Matthews|title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, August 1841 |work=A Church Mission in New Zealand|accessdate=9 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1841_05/2| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> In 1852 arguments developed between one chief and his tribe, however the impact of the missionaries meant that the old ways of settling disputes had passed.<ref name=\"Oct1853\">{{cite web |first   =| last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, October 1853|work= Kaitaia|accessdate=18 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1853_10/2| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nRichard Matthews, the brother of Rev.
