He was the son of the [[parish]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of [[Cults, Fife|Cults]], Fife. [[Caroline Chevalier|Caroline Wilkie]] was a relative.<ref>{{DNZB|Day|Melvin N. |1c16|Chevalier, Caroline and Chevalier, Nicholas|30 September 2017}}</ref> He developed a love for art at an early age. In 1799, after he had attended school at [[Pitlessie]], [[Kingskettle]] and [[Cupar]], his father reluctantly agreed to his becoming a painter. Through the influence of the [[Earl of Leven]] Wilkie was admitted to the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]] in [[Edinburgh]], and began the study of art under [[John Graham (painter)|John Graham]]. From [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] (afterwards Sir William Allan and president of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]) and [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], the engraver of Wilkie's works, we have an interesting account of his early studies, of his indomitable perseverance and power of close application, of his habit of haunting fairs and marketplaces, and transferring to his sketchbook all that struck him as characteristic and telling in figure or incident, and of his admiration for the works of [[Alexander Carse]] and [[David Allan (Scottish painter 1744\u20131796)|David Allan]], two Scottish painters of scenes from humble life.\n\nAmong his pictures of this period might be mentioned a subject from ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] in Search of [[Proserpina|Proserpine]]'', and ''[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Calisto]]'', which in 1803 gained a premium of ten guineas at the Trustees' Academy, while his pencil portraits of himself and his mother, dated that year, and now in the possession of the [[Duke of Buccleuch]], prove that Wilkie had already attained considerable certainty of touch and power of rendering character.{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} A scene from [[Allan Ramsay (1713\u20131784)|Allan Ramsay]], and a sketch from [[Hector Macneill]]'s ballad  ''Scotland's Skaith'', afterwards developed into the well-known ''Village Politicians''.\n\nIn 1804, Wilkie left the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]] and returned to Cults.<ref>[[Edward Pinnington|Pinnington, Edward]], ''Sir David Wilkie and the Scots School of Painters,'' Edinburgh: (Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier), 1900, ([[List of books for the \"Famous Scots Series\"|\"Famous Scots Series\"]]). Ch. IV, p.32.</ref> He established himself in the [[manse]] there, and began his first important subject-picture, ''Pitlessie Fair'' (''illustration''), which includes about 140 figures, and in which he introduced portraits of his neighbours and of several members of his family circle. In addition to this elaborate figure-piece, Wilkie was much employed at the time upon portraits, both at home and in [[Kinghorn]], [[St Andrews]] and [[Aberdeen]]. In the spring of 1805 he left Scotland for London, carrying with him his ''Bounty-Money, or the Village Recruit'', which he soon disposed of for \u00a36, and began to study in the schools of the [[Royal Academy]].

After its completion he returned to genre-painting, producing the ''Card-Players'' and the admirable picture of the ''Rent Day'' which was composed during recovery from a fever contracted in 1807 while on a visit to his native village. His next great work was the ''Ale-House Door'', afterwards entitled ''The Village Festival'' (now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]]), which was purchased by [[John Julius Angerstein]] for 800 guineas.

The ''Reception of the King at the Entrance of Holyrood Palace'' was the incident ultimately chosen; and in the following year, when the artist, upon the death of [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn]], had been appointed [[Painter and Limner|Royal Limner for Scotland]], he received sittings from the monarch, and began to work diligently upon the subject. But several years elapsed before its completion; for, like all such ceremonial works, it proved a harassing commission, uncongenial to the painter while in progress and unsatisfactory when finished. His health suffered from the strain to which he was subjected, and his condition was aggravated by heavy domestic trials and responsibilities.\n\n== Three more years of foreign travel ==\nIn 1825 he sought relief in foreign travel: after visiting Paris, he went to [[Italy]],<ref name=\"gent\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=lAIJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA539&dq=%22John+Hollins%22+-chelsea++-football+portrait&as_brr=3#PPA539,M1 Obituary], [[John Hollins (artist)|John Hollins]], Gentleman's Magazine, 1855, p539, accessed May 2009</ref> where, in [[Rome]], he received the news of fresh disasters through the failure of his publishers. A residence at Toplitz and [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] was tried in 1826, with little good result, and then Wilkie returned to [[Italy]], to [[Venice]] and [[Florence]]. The summer of 1827 was spent in [[Geneva]], where he had sufficiently recovered to paint his ''Princess Doria Washing the Pilgrims' Feet'', a work which, like several small pictures executed in Rome, was strongly influenced by the Italian art by which the painter had been surrounded. In October he passed into [[Spain]], whence he returned to Britain in June 1828.\n\nIt is impossible to overestimate the influence upon Wilkie's art of these three years of foreign travel. It amounts to nothing short of a complete change of style. Up to the period of his leaving Britain he had been mainly influenced by the Dutch genre-painters, whose technique he had carefully studied, whose works he frequently kept beside him in his studio for reference as he painted, and whose method he applied to the rendering of those scenes of English and Scottish life of which he was so close and faithful an observer. [[David Teniers the younger|Teniers]], in particular, appears to have been his chief master; and in his earlier productions we find the sharp, precise, spirited touch, the rather subdued colouring, and the clear, silvery grey tone which distinguish this master; while in his subjects of a slightly later period \u2013 those, such as the ''Chelsea Pensioners'', the ''Highland Whisky Still'' and the ''Rabbit on the Wall'', executed in what Burnet styles his second manner, which, however, may be regarded as only the development and maturity of his first \u2013 he begins to unite to the qualities of Teniers that greater richness and fulness of effect which are characteristic of Ostade. But now he experienced the spell of the Italian masters, and of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and the great Spaniards.\n\n== Latter years ==\n[[File:Josephine and the Fortune-Teller 1837 David Wilkie.jpg|thumb|''[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] and the Fortune-Teller'' (1837)]]\n[[File:Sir David Wilkie's residence in Kensington London, by William Collins 1841 (painted just after Wilkie's death).JPG|thumb|Sir David Wilkie's residence in Kensington London, by [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]] 1841 (painted just after Wilkie's death)]]\nIn the works which Wilkie produced in his final period he exchanged the detailed handling, the delicate finish and the reticent hues of his earlier works for a style distinguished by breadth of touch, largeness of effect, richness of tone and full force of melting and powerful colour. His subjects, too, were no longer the homely things of the genre-painter: with his broader method he attempted the portrayal of scenes from history, suggested for the most part by the associations of his foreign travel. His change of style and change of subject were severely criticized at the time; to some extent he lost his hold upon the public, who regretted the familiar subjects and the interest and pathos of his earlier productions, and were less ready to follow him into the historic scenes towards which this final phase of his art sought to lead them. The popular verdict had in it a basis of truth: Wilkie was indeed greatest as a genre-painter. But on technical grounds his change of style was criticized with undue severity. While his later works are admittedly more frequently faulty in form and draftsmanship than those of his earlier period, some of them at least (''The Bride at her Toilet'', 1838, for instance) show a true gain and development in power of handling, and in mastery over complex and forcible colour harmonies. Most of Wilkie's foreign subjects \u2013 the ''Pifferari'', ''Princess Doria'', the ''Maid of Saragossa'', the ''Spanish Podado'', a ''Guerilla Council of War'', the ''Guerilla Taking Leave of his Family'' and the ''Guerilla's Return to his Family'' \u2013 passed into the English royal collection; but the dramatic ''Two Spanish Monks of Toledo'', also entitled the ''Confessor Confessing'', became the property of the [[Marquis of Lansdowne]].\n\nOn his return to England Wilkie completed the ''Reception of the King at the Entrance of [[Holyrood Palace]]'' \u2013 a curious example of a union of his earlier and later styles, a \"mixture\" which was very justly pronounced by Haydon to be \"like oil and water\". His ''Preaching of [[John Knox]] before the Lords of the Congregation'' had also been begun before he left for abroad; but it was painted throughout in the later style, and consequently presents a more satisfactory unity and harmony of treatment and handling. It was one of the most successful pictures of the artist's later period.\n\nIn the beginning of 1830 Wilkie was appointed to succeed [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]] as painter in ordinary to the king, and in 1836 he received the honour of [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]]. The main figure-pictures which occupied him until the end were ''Columbus in the Convent at La Rabida'' (1835); ''Napoleon and [[Pius VII]] at Fontainebleau'' (1836); ''Empress Josephine and the Fortune-Teller'' (1837); ''Queen Victoria Presiding at her First Council'' (exhibited 1838); and ''General Sir David Baird Discovering the Body of [[Sultan Tippoo Sahib]]'' (completed 1839). His time was also much occupied with portraiture, many of his works of this class being royal commissions. His portraits are pictorial and excellent in general distribution, but the faces are frequently wanting in drawing and character. He seldom succeeded in showing his sitters at their best, and his female portraits, in particular, rarely gave satisfaction. A favourable example of his cabinet-sized portraits is that of Sir Robert Listen<!-- not Lister??? -->; his likeness of W. Esdaile is an admirable three-quarter length; and one of his finest full-lengths is the gallery portrait of Lord Kellie, in the town hall of [[Cupar]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1840 Wilkie resolved on a voyage to the East. Passing through Holland and Germany, he reached Constantinople, where, while detained by the war in Syria, he painted a portrait of the young sultan. He then sailed for [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and travelled to [[Jerusalem]], where he remained for some five busy weeks. The last work of all upon which he was engaged was a portrait of [[Mehemet Ali]], done at [[Alexandria]]. On his return voyage he suffered from an attack of illness at [[Malta]], and remained ill for the remainder of the journey to [[Gibraltar]], eventually dying at sea off Gibraltar, en route to Britain, on the morning of 1 June 1841. His body was consigned to the deep in the [[Bay of Gibraltar]]. Wilkie's death was commemorated by the British painter [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] in the oil painting titled  ''Peace\u2014Burial at Sea''.\n\n== Achievements ==\n[[File:Sir David Wilkie Memorial, Cults Kirk.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Wilkie, erected by his sister in the church at his birthplace in Fife]]\nAn elaborate Life of Sir David Wilkie, by [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]], containing the painter's journals and his observant and well-considered \"Critical Remarks on Works of Art\", was published in 1843. Redgrave's ''Century of Painters of the English School'' and [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]]'s ''Practical Essays on the Fine Arts'' may also be referred to for a critical estimate of his works. A list of the exceptionally numerous and excellent engravings from his pictures will be found in the ''[[The Art Journal|The Art Union]]'' for January 1840. Apart from his skill as a painter Wilkie was an admirable [[etcher]]. The best of his plates, such as the ''Gentleman at his Desk'' (Laing, VII), the ''Pope examining a Censer'' (Laing, VIII), and the ''Seat of Hands'' (Laing, IV), are worthy to rank with the work of the greatest figure-etchers. During his lifetime he issued a portfolio of seven plates, and in 1875 [[David Laing (Scottish antiquary)|David Laing]] catalogued and published the complete series of his etchings and dry-points, supplying the place of a few copper-plates that had been lost by reproductions, in his ''Etchings of David Wilkie and Andrew Geddes''.\n\n== Legacy ==\nWilkie stood as godfather to the son of his fellow Academician [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]].  The boy was named after both men, and achieved fame as the novelist [[Wilkie Collins]].\n\n== In fiction ==\nA painting which might be a real Wilkie or only a copy (the question is only resolved in the latter half of the book) plays a role in the novel ''Winter Solstice'' by [[Rosamunde Pilcher]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Orientalist artists]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Wilkie, Sir David |volume=28|page=644\u2013645}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite DNB|wstitle=Wilkie, David|volume=61|page=253 ff. |short=x}}\n* Woodward, John (Ed.).

[[Caroline Chevalier|Caroline Wilkie]] was a relative.<ref>{{DNZB|Day|Melvin N. |1c16|Chevalier, Caroline and Chevalier, Nicholas|30 September 2017}}</ref> He developed a love for art at an early age. In 1799, after he had attended school at [[Pitlessie]], [[Kingskettle]] and [[Cupar]], his father reluctantly agreed to his becoming a painter. Through the influence of the [[Earl of Leven]] Wilkie was admitted to the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]] in [[Edinburgh]], and began the study of art under [[John Graham (painter)|John Graham]]. From [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] (afterwards Sir William Allan and president of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]) and [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], the engraver of Wilkie's works, we have an interesting account of his early studies, of his indomitable perseverance and power of close application, of his habit of haunting fairs and marketplaces, and transferring to his sketchbook all that struck him as characteristic and telling in figure or incident, and of his admiration for the works of [[Alexander Carse]] and [[David Allan (Scottish painter 1744\u20131796)|David Allan]], two Scottish painters of scenes from humble life.\n\nAmong his pictures of this period might be mentioned a subject from ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] in Search of [[Proserpina|Proserpine]]'', and ''[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Calisto]]'', which in 1803 gained a premium of ten guineas at the Trustees' Academy, while his pencil portraits of himself and his mother, dated that year, and now in the possession of the [[Duke of Buccleuch]], prove that Wilkie had already attained considerable certainty of touch and power of rendering character.{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} A scene from [[Allan Ramsay (1713\u20131784)|Allan Ramsay]], and a sketch from [[Hector Macneill]]'s ballad  ''Scotland's Skaith'', afterwards developed into the well-known ''Village Politicians''.\n\nIn 1804, Wilkie left the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]] and returned to Cults.<ref>[[Edward Pinnington|Pinnington, Edward]], ''Sir David Wilkie and the Scots School of Painters,'' Edinburgh: (Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier), 1900, ([[List of books for the \"Famous Scots Series\"|\"Famous Scots Series\"]]).

But now he experienced the spell of the Italian masters, and of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and the great Spaniards.\n\n== Latter years ==\n[[File:Josephine and the Fortune-Teller 1837 David Wilkie.jpg|thumb|''[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] and the Fortune-Teller'' (1837)]]\n[[File:Sir David Wilkie's residence in Kensington London, by William Collins 1841 (painted just after Wilkie's death).JPG|thumb|Sir David Wilkie's residence in Kensington London, by [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]] 1841 (painted just after Wilkie's death)]]\nIn the works which Wilkie produced in his final period he exchanged the detailed handling, the delicate finish and the reticent hues of his earlier works for a style distinguished by breadth of touch, largeness of effect, richness of tone and full force of melting and powerful colour. His subjects, too, were no longer the homely things of the genre-painter: with his broader method he attempted the portrayal of scenes from history, suggested for the most part by the associations of his foreign travel. His change of style and change of subject were severely criticized at the time; to some extent he lost his hold upon the public, who regretted the familiar subjects and the interest and pathos of his earlier productions, and were less ready to follow him into the historic scenes towards which this final phase of his art sought to lead them. The popular verdict had in it a basis of truth: Wilkie was indeed greatest as a genre-painter. But on technical grounds his change of style was criticized with undue severity. While his later works are admittedly more frequently faulty in form and draftsmanship than those of his earlier period, some of them at least (''The Bride at her Toilet'', 1838, for instance) show a true gain and development in power of handling, and in mastery over complex and forcible colour harmonies. Most of Wilkie's foreign subjects \u2013 the ''Pifferari'', ''Princess Doria'', the ''Maid of Saragossa'', the ''Spanish Podado'', a ''Guerilla Council of War'', the ''Guerilla Taking Leave of his Family'' and the ''Guerilla's Return to his Family'' \u2013 passed into the English royal collection; but the dramatic ''Two Spanish Monks of Toledo'', also entitled the ''Confessor Confessing'', became the property of the [[Marquis of Lansdowne]].\n\nOn his return to England Wilkie completed the ''Reception of the King at the Entrance of [[Holyrood Palace]]'' \u2013 a curious example of a union of his earlier and later styles, a \"mixture\" which was very justly pronounced by Haydon to be \"like oil and water\". His ''Preaching of [[John Knox]] before the Lords of the Congregation'' had also been begun before he left for abroad; but it was painted throughout in the later style, and consequently presents a more satisfactory unity and harmony of treatment and handling. It was one of the most successful pictures of the artist's later period.\n\nIn the beginning of 1830 Wilkie was appointed to succeed [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]] as painter in ordinary to the king, and in 1836 he received the honour of [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]]. The main figure-pictures which occupied him until the end were ''Columbus in the Convent at La Rabida'' (1835); ''Napoleon and [[Pius VII]] at Fontainebleau'' (1836); ''Empress Josephine and the Fortune-Teller'' (1837); ''Queen Victoria Presiding at her First Council'' (exhibited 1838); and ''General Sir David Baird Discovering the Body of [[Sultan Tippoo Sahib]]'' (completed 1839). His time was also much occupied with portraiture, many of his works of this class being royal commissions. His portraits are pictorial and excellent in general distribution, but the faces are frequently wanting in drawing and character. He seldom succeeded in showing his sitters at their best, and his female portraits, in particular, rarely gave satisfaction. A favourable example of his cabinet-sized portraits is that of Sir Robert Listen<!-- not Lister??? -->; his likeness of W. Esdaile is an admirable three-quarter length; and one of his finest full-lengths is the gallery portrait of Lord Kellie, in the town hall of [[Cupar]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1840 Wilkie resolved on a voyage to the East. Passing through Holland and Germany, he reached Constantinople, where, while detained by the war in Syria, he painted a portrait of the young sultan. He then sailed for [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and travelled to [[Jerusalem]], where he remained for some five busy weeks. The last work of all upon which he was engaged was a portrait of [[Mehemet Ali]], done at [[Alexandria]]. On his return voyage he suffered from an attack of illness at [[Malta]], and remained ill for the remainder of the journey to [[Gibraltar]], eventually dying at sea off Gibraltar, en route to Britain, on the morning of 1 June 1841. His body was consigned to the deep in the [[Bay of Gibraltar]]. Wilkie's death was commemorated by the British painter [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] in the oil painting titled  ''Peace\u2014Burial at Sea''.\n\n== Achievements ==\n[[File:Sir David Wilkie Memorial, Cults Kirk.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Wilkie, erected by his sister in the church at his birthplace in Fife]]\nAn elaborate Life of Sir David Wilkie, by [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]], containing the painter's journals and his observant and well-considered \"Critical Remarks on Works of Art\", was published in 1843. Redgrave's ''Century of Painters of the English School'' and [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]]'s ''Practical Essays on the Fine Arts'' may also be referred to for a critical estimate of his works. A list of the exceptionally numerous and excellent engravings from his pictures will be found in the ''[[The Art Journal|The Art Union]]'' for January 1840. Apart from his skill as a painter Wilkie was an admirable [[etcher]]. The best of his plates, such as the ''Gentleman at his Desk'' (Laing, VII), the ''Pope examining a Censer'' (Laing, VIII), and the ''Seat of Hands'' (Laing, IV), are worthy to rank with the work of the greatest figure-etchers. During his lifetime he issued a portfolio of seven plates, and in 1875 [[David Laing (Scottish antiquary)|David Laing]] catalogued and published the complete series of his etchings and dry-points, supplying the place of a few copper-plates that had been lost by reproductions, in his ''Etchings of David Wilkie and Andrew Geddes''.\n\n== Legacy ==\nWilkie stood as godfather to the son of his fellow Academician [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]].  The boy was named after both men, and achieved fame as the novelist [[Wilkie Collins]].\n\n== In fiction ==\nA painting which might be a real Wilkie or only a copy (the question is only resolved in the latter half of the book) plays a role in the novel ''Winter Solstice'' by [[Rosamunde Pilcher]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Orientalist artists]]\n* [[Orientalism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Wilkie, Sir David |volume=28|page=644\u2013645}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite DNB|wstitle=Wilkie, David|volume=61|page=253 ff. |short=x}}\n* Woodward, John (Ed.).

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning personae he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees to drank and played pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything.

Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face, and beat him. Schroeder agreed, and in early September, he lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace into the youth's eyes, then beat him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n===Conviction and imprisonment===\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nOn November 7, 1968 Gacy pled guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths. Gacy said that Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, to be served at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} That same day, his wife petitioned for divorce,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting award of the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and [[alimony]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} When told the news, Gacy collapsed to the floor sobbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} His request for supervised compassionate leave to attend the funeral was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} who claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. This complaint was dismissed when the boy failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were later [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth who claimed that Gacy had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}} \n\nBy 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects at once and frequently traveled to other states.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n====Young employees====\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the employee in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} After returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy told his wife he had been attacked for refusing to pay the employee for poor-quality work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy went to Antonucci's home. The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual [[stag film]] before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a high school wrestler\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy at first threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n=====Cram and Rossi=====\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while Cram was drunk. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door and again attempted to rape Cram, saying: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space.

Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18 Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner who supervised the exhumations, testified that all the bodies were \"markedly decomposed<!--,--> [and] putrefied<!--, skeletalized remains-->\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} and ten in undetermined ways.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}{{efn|Stein performed autopsies on each victim recovered at Gacy's property and upon the body of Robert Piest.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department.

Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967.

His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth who claimed that Gacy had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}} \n\nBy 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects at once and frequently traveled to other states.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n====Young employees====\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased.

When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a high school wrestler\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy at first threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n=====Cram and Rossi=====\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram.

Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember.  He confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18 Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner who supervised the exhumations, testified that all the bodies were \"markedly decomposed<!--,--> [and] putrefied<!--, skeletalized remains-->\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} and ten in undetermined ways.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}{{efn|Stein performed autopsies on each victim recovered at Gacy's property and upon the body of Robert Piest.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 342</ref>{{efn|Gacy is known to have given Ressler a painting with a written inscription reading: \"Dear Bob Ressler, You cannot hope to enjoy the harvest, without first laboring in the fields\".<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 343</ref>}}\n\nJeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, watched his abuse.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=209}} Rignall also said that as Gacy was assaulting him he saw a light switch on in another part of the house.<ref name=\"google2963\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19790101&id=PEEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v80EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2963,232748|title=Search of Gacy Home to Resume|date=January 2, 1979|publisher=Spartanburg Herald-Journal}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, on one occasion during the surveillance of Gacy prior to his arrest, two officers followed him to a bar to which Gacy had driven to meet two of his employees. At the bar, the officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the employee asked Gacy, \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

Unlike incest in Egypt, or Rome, or Medieval European royalty, this form of nuclear family incest was not relegated to just royalty but was widely popular among all facets of society from slaves, to free men, to the middle class, aristocrats and royalty.

For example, [[Al-Tha'alibi]] writes that Zoroastrian legalized marriage between brothers and sisters and fathers and daughters because Adam had married his sons to his daughters.

Numerous classical sources and later authors point to the incarnation of incest in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] monarchies of the [[Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] dynasties. Some of the earliest Greek references to non-royal incest are those by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] in his book Magica, which [[Clement of Alexandria]] quoted as saying that [[Magi]] had sex with their mothers, daughters and sisters, and that [[Ctesias]] had mentioned a brother-sister marriage.
