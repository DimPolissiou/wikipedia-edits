The village of [[Krithia]] and neighbouring hill of [[Achi Baba]] had to be captured in order for the British to advance up the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula to the forts that controlled passage of the [[Dardanelles]] straits. A small amount of ground was captured after two days of costly fighting but the objectives remained out of reach.\n\n==Prelude==\n===Forces===\nFollowing the failure of the [[First Battle of Krithia]], the exhausted soldiers of the [[British 29th Division]] halted to consolidate their positions. They had to endure a number of Ottoman counter-attacks on 1 and 4 May.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 7</ref> Similar counter-attacks were repulsed at the Anzac landing on 2 May so that General [[William Birdwood]], commander of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] deemed his front sufficiently secure to enable two [[brigade]]s to be moved to Helles for the next assault on Krithia. These were the [[2nd Brigade (Australia)|Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade]] and the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade]], around 5,000 men.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 4</ref>\n\nOther British reinforcements included brigades from the [[Royal Naval Division]] and the 125th Brigade from the [[British 42nd (East Lancashire) Division]]. The 87th and 88th Brigades of the 29th Division would once again be at the forefront of the attack. The Anzac brigades and General [[Herbert Cox]]'s [[29th Indian Brigade]] (Indian Expeditionary Force G)would be in reserve. The commander at Helles, [[Major General]] [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]], was woefully lacking in shells for his [[artillery]] and those he did have were [[shrapnel shell]]s which was ineffective against entrenched positions. The navy were somewhat ambitiously still hoarding shells for the anticipated assault on [[Constantinople]].\n\nThe Ottomans had also been reinforcing their defences around Krithia. According to [[Kiazim Pasha]] the following units were responsible for the defence of Krithia:<ref name=bean41>Bean (1941), p. 41</ref>\n*1/ and 2/29th Regt (10th Div),\n*2/56th Regt. (15th Div),\n*2/19th Regt. (7th Div),\n*1/ and 4/26th Regt. (9th Div), and\n*15th Regt. (5th Div).\n\nThe infantry actually in front of Krithia on 8 May comprised:\n*2/25th Regt. (9th Div),\n*1/20th Regt. (7th Div), and\n*2/56th Regt. (15th Div).\n\nThe Ottomans had seven field-batteries positioned on either side of Achi Baba, as well as a six-gun battery of {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} howitzers.<ref name=bean41/>\n\n===Terrain===\n[[Image:MapHellesWarZoneGallipoli1915.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Map of Helles war zone</center>]]\nWhile [[Cape Helles]] is more forgiving than the wild terrain at [[Anzac Cove]], the battlefield still presented difficulties to the attacking force. The ground looked flat but was riven by four large gullies, or ''deres'', running from Achi Baba towards the Cape. On the west was Gully Ravine which was separated from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] shore by Gully Spur. Moving east was Fir Tree Spur then Krithia Valley (also known as Krithia Nullah or Kirte Dere) then Krithia Spur then Kanli Dere then Kereves Spur then Kereves Dere which flows into the [[Dardanelles]] at Morto Bay. Krithia Spur was bare and exposed so was not favoured for attacks. Gully Spur and Fir Tree Spur offered some cover and so the majority of the British advances were made on these spurs and in the shelter of the gullies.\n\n===Plan===\nLike the first battle, the plan was for a general advance on a broad front across the peninsula.  The attack was divided into three phases. The first phase involved a general advance of one mile across the entire front which would place the French, on the right of the line, astride Kereves Spur where they were to dig in. In the second phase, the British in the centre and on the left would pivot on the French position and sweep up Fir Tree Spur and Gully Spur then capture Krithia village. The third phase would be the capture of Achi Baba.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 11</ref>\n\nIn the end, after three days of fighting, the Allies would abandon the battle without even completing the first phase. In fact, the greatest advance achieved was a mere {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The plan was made despite the fact that the British had no clear idea where the Ottoman fortifications were. There was as yet no continuous system of trenches and aerial [[reconnaissance]] had failed to locate the defences. Consequently, the preliminary bombardments that were made before each advance were utterly ineffectual. Hunter-Weston also insisted that the attacks be made in broad daylight, fearing that an attack under the cover of darkness would become confused.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 3</ref> Having failed with this approach once during the first battle did not deter Hunter-Weston, and as the second battle progressed he would remain undeterred.\n\n==Battle==\nThe Allied advance began later than scheduled, around 11:00 on 6 May, and was swiftly halted by strong Ottoman resistance. The 88th Brigade of the 29th Division advancing on Fir Tree Spur managed to capture Fir Tree Wood, and the 6th (Hood) Battalion of the [[British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division]] advanced strongly along Kanli Dere, but at all points on the line the gains were never more than {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}}. At no point were the Ottoman defences reached. The attack was resumed on 7 May; it used the same plan and produced largely the same results.\n\nOn the morning of 8 May, the 88th Brigade in front of Krithia on Fir Tree Spur was relieved by the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade|New Zealand]]ers who made yet another attempt which failed with huge losses. The Wellington, Canterbury and Auckland Battalions gained another {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} through Fir Tree Wood to a place called the 'Daisy Patch' before they became pinned down. [[Enfilade]]d on the left from Ottoman [[machine gun]]s in Gully Ravine, they could neither advance nor withdraw and still had no sight of the Ottoman positions.\n\nDespite their predicament, Hunter-Weston ordered the New Zealanders, including the Otago Battalion in reserve, to resume that attack at 17:30. The brigade commander, Colonel [[Francis Earl Johnston|Francis Johnston]], protested but Hunter-Weston insisted the attack proceed. However, General [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)|Sir Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], who had landed at Helles to oversee the battle, ordered a general advance to be made at 17:30 along the entire front with the aim of capturing Krithia and Achi Baba.<ref>Bean (1941), pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade, under the command of [[Brigadier-General]] [[James Whiteside M'Cay|M'Cay]], was given 35 minutes warning that it was about to join the attack. The Australians were to advance along Krithia Spur between the right flank of the New Zealand brigade and the edge of Kanli Dere,<ref name=bean23>Bean (1941), p. 23</ref> and had to travel up to {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}} from their reserve position just to reach the start line at \"Tommy's Trench\". The brigade managed to advance a further {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the start line, suffering 50% casualties in the process.\n\nThe New Zealand brigade made another attempt to cross the Daisy Patch, and some troops managed to actually sight the Ottoman trenches. On the right, the French resumed their advance at 18:00 and made good progress, reaching the Ottoman trenches on Kereves Dere. They managed to capture and hold Bouchet Redoubt but were forced back everywhere else.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAbout \u2153 of the Allied soldiers who fought in the battle became casualties. General Hamilton could ill-afford such losses as they made it difficult enough to hold the little ground he had, let alone continue to capture more. The poor planning of the battle extended to the medical provisions for the wounded which were woeful. The few stretcher bearers that were available often had to carry their burdens all the way to the beach as there was no intermediate collecting station with wagon transport. The [[hospital ship]] arrangements were also inadequate so that once the wounded were taken off the beach they would have trouble finding a ship prepared to take them on board.\n\nWith the failure of the second battle, Hamilton made a request to the British [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], for an additional four divisions. He was promised the [[British 52nd (Lowland) Division]] but would not receive any more until August. Another attempt to capture Krithia would not be made until early June.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bean |first=Charles |year=1941 |origyear=1926 |title=The Story of ANZAC from 4 May 1915, to the Evacuation of the Gallipoli Peninsula |edition=11th |series=[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918]] |volume=II |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1069751/ |oclc=220051990}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|title=The White Gurkhas: the 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade at Krithia, Gallipoli| first=Ronald|last=Austin|year=1989|isbn=0-7316-5323-8}}\n\n==External links==\n*Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. 46, 27 May 1915, pp.&nbsp;981\u2013982 ([http://www.nla.gov.au/gallipolidespatches/1-06-second_battle.html online version at the National Library of Australia])\n*[[The Age]], 18 June 1915, p.&nbsp;10 ([http://www.nla.gov.au/gallipolidespatches/1-06-second_battle.html online transcript at the National Library of Australia])\n*Major Fred Waite: ''New Zealanders at Gallipoli''.

According to [[Kiazim Pasha]] the following units were responsible for the defence of Krithia:<ref name=bean41>Bean (1941), p.41</ref>\n*1/ and 2/29th Regt (10th Div),\n*2/56th Regt. (15th Div),\n*2/19th Regt. (7th Div),\n*1/ and 4/26th Regt. (9th Div), and\n*15th Regt. (5th Div).\n\nThe infantry actually in front of Krithia on 8 May comprised:\n*2/25th Regt. (9th Div),\n*1/20th Regt. (7th Div), and\n*2/56th Regt. (15th Div).\n\nThe Ottomans had seven field-batteries positioned on either side of Achi Baba, as well as a six-gun battery of {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} howitzers.<ref name=bean41/>\n\n===Terrain===\n[[Image:MapHellesWarZoneGallipoli1915.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Map of Helles war zone</center>]]\nWhile [[Cape Helles]] is more forgiving than the wild terrain at [[Anzac Cove]], the battlefield still presented difficulties to the attacking force. The ground looked flat but was riven by four large gullies, or ''deres'', running from Achi Baba towards the Cape. On the west was Gully Ravine which was separated from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] shore by Gully Spur. Moving east was Fir Tree Spur then Krithia Valley (also known as Krithia Nullah or Kirte Dere) then Krithia Spur then Kanli Dere then Kereves Spur then Kereves Dere which flows into the [[Dardanelles]] at Morto Bay. Krithia Spur was bare and exposed so was not favoured for attacks. Gully Spur and Fir Tree Spur offered some cover and so the majority of the British advances were made on these spurs and in the shelter of the gullies.\n\n===Plan===\nLike the first battle, the plan was for a general advance on a broad front across the peninsula.  The attack was divided into three phases. The first phase involved a general advance of one mile across the entire front which would place the French, on the right of the line, astride Kereves Spur where they were to dig in. In the second phase, the British in the centre and on the left would pivot on the French position and sweep up Fir Tree Spur and Gully Spur then capture Krithia village. The third phase would be the capture of Achi Baba.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 11</ref>\n\nIn the end, after three days of fighting, the Allies would abandon the battle without even completing the first phase. In fact, the greatest advance achieved was a mere {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The plan was made despite the fact that the British had no clear idea where the Ottoman fortifications were. There was as yet no continuous system of trenches and aerial [[reconnaissance]] had failed to locate the defences. Consequently, the preliminary bombardments that were made before each advance were utterly ineffectual. Hunter-Weston also insisted that the attacks be made in broad daylight, fearing that an attack under the cover of darkness would become confused.<ref>Bean (1941), p. 3</ref> Having failed with this approach once during the first battle did not deter Hunter-Weston, and as the second battle progressed he would remain undeterred.\n\n==Battle==\nThe Allied advance began later than scheduled, around 11:00 on 6 May, and was swiftly halted by strong Ottoman resistance. The 88th Brigade of the 29th Division advancing on Fir Tree Spur managed to capture Fir Tree Wood, and the 6th (Hood) Battalion of the [[British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division]] advanced strongly along Kanli Dere, but at all points on the line the gains were never more than {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}}. At no point were the Ottoman defences reached. The attack was resumed on 7 May; it used the same plan and produced largely the same results.\n\nOn the morning of 8 May, the 88th Brigade in front of Krithia on Fir Tree Spur was relieved by the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade|New Zealand]]ers who made yet another attempt which failed with huge losses. The Wellington, Canterbury and Auckland Battalions gained another {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} through Fir Tree Wood to a place called the 'Daisy Patch' before they became pinned down. [[Enfilade]]d on the left from Ottoman [[machine gun]]s in Gully Ravine, they could neither advance nor withdraw and still had no sight of the Ottoman positions.\n\nDespite their predicament, Hunter-Weston ordered the New Zealanders, including the Otago Battalion in reserve, to resume that attack at 17:30. The brigade commander, Colonel [[Francis Earl Johnston|Francis Johnston]], protested but Hunter-Weston insisted the attack proceed. However, General [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)|Sir Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], who had landed at Helles to oversee the battle, ordered a general advance to be made at 17:30 along the entire front with the aim of capturing Krithia and Achi Baba.<ref>Bean (1941), pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade, under the command of [[Brigadier-General]] [[James Whiteside M'Cay|M'Cay]], was given 35 minutes warning that it was about to join the attack. The Australians were to advance along Krithia Spur between the right flank of the New Zealand brigade and the edge of Kanli Dere,<ref name=bean41>Bean (1941), p. 23</ref> and had to travel up to {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}} from their reserve position just to reach the start line at \"Tommy's Trench\". The brigade managed to advance a further {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the start line, suffering 50% casualties in the process.\n\nThe New Zealand brigade made another attempt to cross the Daisy Patch, and some troops managed to actually sight the Ottoman trenches. On the right, the French resumed their advance at 18:00 and made good progress, reaching the Ottoman trenches on Kereves Dere. They managed to capture and hold Bouchet Redoubt but were forced back everywhere else.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAbout \u2153 of the Allied soldiers who fought in the battle became casualties. General Hamilton could ill-afford such losses as they made it difficult enough to hold the little ground he had, let alone continue to capture more. The poor planning of the battle extended to the medical provisions for the wounded which were woeful. The few stretcher bearers that were available often had to carry their burdens all the way to the beach as there was no intermediate collecting station with wagon transport. The [[hospital ship]] arrangements were also inadequate so that once the wounded were taken off the beach they would have trouble finding a ship prepared to take them on board.\n\nWith the failure of the second battle, Hamilton made a request to the British [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], for an additional four divisions. He was promised the [[British 52nd (Lowland) Division]] but would not receive any more until August. Another attempt to capture Krithia would not be made until early June.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bean |first=Charles |year=1941 |origyear=1926 |title=The Story of ANZAC from 4 May 1915, to the Evacuation of the Gallipoli Peninsula |edition=11th |series=[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918]] |volume=II |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1069751/ |oclc=220051990}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|title=The White Gurkhas: the 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade at Krithia, Gallipoli| first=Ronald|last=Austin|year=1989|isbn=0-7316-5323-8}}\n\n==External links==\n*Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. 46, 27 May 1915, pp.&nbsp;981\u2013982 ([http://www.nla.gov.au/gallipolidespatches/1-06-second_battle.html online version at the National Library of Australia])\n*[[The Age]], 18 June 1915, p.&nbsp;10 ([http://www.nla.gov.au/gallipolidespatches/1-06-second_battle.html online transcript at the National Library of Australia])\n*Major Fred Waite: ''New Zealanders at Gallipoli''.

He hates his job and reaches out through [[LinkedIn]], but fails to find a proper job. He is a part of an orthodox family. His mother is a homemaker and his father is a part of the [[RSS (politics)|RSS]]. He has a love story with a colleague named Zara, who is pursuing her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in IIT. Zara is from a [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiri Muslim]] family and their love story ends due to their families, who fight over religious issues. Keshav couldn\u2019t come out of it and keeps remembering Zara, who then loves Raghu (Keshav\u2019s classmate). Raghu happens to be an intelligent person with a geeky look. Keshav often calls Zara begging her to come back to him, but she never agrees. Saurabh (Keshav's friend) bids Keshav to forget his past love and focus on his future.\n\nOn Zara's birthday, Keshav controls his urge to call Zara and wish her at midnight. He and Saurabh drink and fall asleep. Around 3 a.m. in the morning, he gets [[Text messaging|text messages]] from Zara asking him why he didn\u2019t wish her this year. Zara goes on and tells him to meet her in her room immediately. Keshav complies and rushes to Zara's room to wish her in person.\n\nAs Keshav enters the room, he finds that the room is dark and its utterly silent. Zara is asleep on the bed. He touches her forehead and feels a cold chill. He then switches on the light and sees her dead. He informs Saurabh who suggests they run away from the scene. But Keshav becomes determined to find the killer. He informs the police, Raghu, and Zara\u2019s parents. The police arrests the watchman of the hostel, who is missed from the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] camera during the time Zara was killed. Although police close the case afterwords, Keshav continues his investigation. Keshav digs deeper, with the help of police Inspector Vikas Rana. He first suspects Prof. Saxena (Zara's [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. guide), who tries to harass Zara. Then, Prof. Saxena is withdrawn as a suspect in Zara's murder case after finding out the truth. \n\nAfter seeking of new suspects in the murder case, he tries to find Sikander, Zara\u2019s stepbrother who happens to be part of a terrorist group in [[Kashmir]]. Keshav seeks help from Zara\u2019s father and checks her room for clues. He finds a locker with gunpowder, pregnancy kits, and selfies of Sikander with a gun along with Zara who happens to be smiling in the picture. Keshav goes through the clues one by one. He first tries to meet Sikander and asks him about his group called Tehreek. Sikander gets afraid and threatens them with a gun and runs away. They try to reach him out through his mother in Kashmir. Sikander meets them again and tries to explain that he is not the murderer. But with the proper clues, Keshav almost gets convinced that Sikander killed his sister in the fear that Tehreek might be known to the army. The next day Sikander kills himself, telling that his existence would harm Tehreek and convince everyone that he did not kill his sister. After the suicide of Sikander, Keshav realizes he made a mistake by doubting upon him.\n\nHe then finds out about the pregnancy kits Zara had in her [[safe]] and sees a picture of an army officer (\"Captain Faiz Khan\") in [[Kashmir]] with Zara, in her [[Instagram]]. After proper investigation, he finds out that the army officer has gifted Zara expensive jewelry and they raid his house in Delhi. They find the same pregnancy kits and check his internet history, which has search histories related to abortion and divorce. They also find gold blocks in his house and get convinced with the theory that he made Zara pregnant and killed her in guilt. They arrange a dinner party to announce the victim and arrest him unknowingly by inviting everyone Zara knew, after the 100th day of her death. Just before Keshav announces the killer, he goes on a little trip to [[Hyderabad]]. This is when he realizes that Raghu is the real killer. Raghu confesses to have killed Zara. He killed Zara because he found out she had an affair with her childhood friend, Captain Faiz, and was perhaps pregnant with his child; Faiz tells, however, that she wasn't. While they did have an affair, it ended because Faiz was married and Zara didn't want him to leave his wife and kids, and because Zara loved Raghu. Keshav learns that Raghu had sent the text messages to him on Zara's birthday, and that Zara was already dead. Raghu is arrested by Inspector Rana.

The floods struck the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nA combination of a high [[spring tide]] and a severe [[European windstorm]] over the [[North Sea]] caused a [[storm tide of the North Sea|storm tide]]; the combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure led to a water level of more than {{convert|5.6|m|ft|1}} above mean sea level in some locations. The flood and waves overwhelmed sea defences and caused extensive flooding. The [[Netherlands]], a country with 20% of its territory below [[mean sea level]] and 50% less than {{convert|1|m|ft|1}} above sea level and which relies heavily on sea defences, was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage. Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of [[Zeeland]]. In England, 307 people were killed in the [[county (England)|counties]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]]. Nineteen were killed in Scotland. Twenty-eight people were killed in [[West Flanders]], Belgium.\n\nIn addition, more than 230 deaths occurred on water craft along [[Northern Europe]]an coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea. The ferry [[MV Princess Victoria|MV ''Princess Victoria'']] was lost at sea in the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] east of [[Belfast]] with 133 fatalities, and many [[fishing trawlers]] sank.\n\nRealising that such infrequent events could reoccur, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom carried out major studies on strengthening of coastal defences. The Netherlands developed the [[Delta Works]], an extensive system of dams and [[storm surge barrier]]s. The UK constructed storm surge barriers on the [[River Thames]] below London and on the [[River Hull]] where it meets the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n== Netherlands ==\n{{external media\n| float  =\n| width  =\n| video1 = \"Eerste beelden van de stormramp\" [First images of the storm] parts [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80035/false/true 1], [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80034/false/true 2] & [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80033/false/true 3] \u2013 ''[[Polygoon (newsreel)|Polygoon]]'' newsreel, 1\u20132 February 1953.

On both the islands and the mainland, large areas of the country were flooded. Many people still commemorate the dead on 1 February. In Dutch history and culture this flood has been named ''\"de Watersnoodramp\"''.\n\n=== Warnings ===\nThe [[Rijkswaterstaat]] had warned about the risk of a flood.<ref name=\"ley196110\">{{cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |author= |last2= |first2= |date=October 1961 |title=The Home-Made Land |department=For Your Information |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v19n06_1961-08#page/n65/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=92\u2013106 |type= }}</ref> At the time of the flood, none of the local radio stations broadcast at night, and many of the smaller [[weather station]]s operated only during the day. As a result, the warnings of the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) did not penetrate the flood-threatened area in time. People were unable to prepare for the impending flood. The disaster struck on a Saturday night, and hence many government and emergency offices in the affected area were not staffed.\n\nAs telephone and [[telegraph]] networks were disrupted by flood damage, [[amateur radio operator]]s went into the affected areas with their equipment to form a voluntary emergency radio network. These radio amateurs provided radio communications for 10 days and nights, and were the only people able to maintain contact from affected areas with the outside world.<ref>{{cite document |title=Amateur radio emergency network during 1953 flood \u2013 IEEE Xplore Document |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.825908 }}</ref>\n\n=== Resulting damage ===\n[[File:North Sea flood of 1953.png|thumb|left|Extent of flooding in the Netherlands]]\n\nThe Zeeland dikes were breached in 67 locations.{{r|ley196110}} Large parts of South Holland, Zeeland and North Brabant were inundated. In [[North Holland]] only one [[polder]] was flooded. The most extensive flooding occurred on the islands of [[Schouwen-Duiveland]], [[Tholen]], [[Sint Philipsland (island)|Sint Philipsland]], [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], the [[Hoeksche Waard]], [[Voorne-Putten]] and [[Alblasserwaard]]. Parts of the islands of [[Zuid-Beveland]], [[Noord-Beveland]], [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]], [[Pernis (Netherlands)|Pernis]], [[Rozenburg]], [[Walcheren]] and [[Land van Altena]] were flooded, as well as parts of the areas around [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]], [[Nieuw-Vossemeer]] and parts of [[Zeelandic Flanders]].\n\nThe highest death tolls were recorded on the islands of [[Schouwen-Duiveland]] and [[Goeree-Overflakkee]].\n\nAfterward, the government formed the Delta Commission to study the causes and effects of the floods. They estimated that flooding killed 1,835&nbsp;people and forced the [[emergency evacuation]] of 70,000 more. Floods covered 9% of Dutch [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]], and sea water flooded {{cvt|1,365|km\u00b2}} of land. An estimated 30,000 animals drowned, and 47,300 buildings were damaged, of which 10,000 were destroyed. The total damage is estimated at 1 billion [[Dutch guilders]].\n\n[[File:Sturmflut 1953 2.jpg|thumb|''Een [[dubbeltje]] op zijn kant''\" (\"A dubbeltje (small coin) on its edge\", meaning \"A narrow escape\"), a sculpture by Roel Bendijk of ''de Twee Gebroeders'' in the Groenedijk]]\n\n==== Near flooding of other parts ====\nThe [[Schielands Hoge Zeedijk]] (Schielands High Seadyke) along the river [[Hollandse IJssel]] was all that protected three million people in the provinces of [[South Holland|South]] and [[North Holland]] from flooding. A section of this dyke, known as the Groenendijk, was not reinforced with stone [[revetment]]s. The water level was just below the crest and the seaward slope was weak.\n\nVolunteers worked to reinforce this stretch. However, the Groenendijk began to collapse under the pressure around 5:30 am on 1 February. Seawater flooded into the deep polder. In desperation, the [[mayor]] of [[Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel|Nieuwerkerk]] commandeered the river ship ''de Twee Gebroeders'' (''The Two Brothers'') and ordered the owner to plug the hole in the dyke by navigating the ship into it. Fearing that the ship might break through into the [[polder]], Captain Arie Evegroen took a [[row boat]] with him. The mayor's plan was successful, as the ship was lodged firmly into the dyke, reinforcing it against failure and saving many lives.\n\nThe [[Afsluitdijk]] across the entrance of the [[Zuiderzee]] was said to have paid for its construction cost in that one night, by preventing destructive flooding around the Zuiderzee.\n\n=== Reaction ===\nSeveral neighbouring countries sent soldiers to assist in searching for bodies and rescuing people. The [[U.S. Army]] sent helicopters from Germany to rescue people from rooftops. [[Queen Juliana]] and [[Princess Beatrix]] visited the flooded area only a few days after. A large aid program - the National Relief Fund came on apace, supported by the radio and soldiers raised funds by selling pea-soup door to door. Internationally, 100,000 commemorative postcards, featuring an illustration by [[Eppo Doeve]], were sold.<ref name=\"europeana\"/> A national donation program was started and there was a large amount of international aid. The [[Red Cross]] \nwas overwhelmed by contributions, and decided to divert some of the funds to assist residents of Third World countries.\n\nIt was found that the flooding could have been {{convert|4|feet}} higher; the Rijkswaterstaat's plan concerning the protection and strengthening of the dikes was accepted. {{r|ley196110}} As a result, the [[Delta Works]] were authorized, an elaborate project to enable emergency closing of the mouths of most [[estuary|estuaries]], to prevent flood surges upriver.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:TB 1953 1.jpg|thumb|A breach at [[Erith]] after the 1953 flood]]\nThe North Sea flood of 1953 was one of the most devastating natural disasters ever recorded in the [[United Kingdom]].

In Lincolnshire, flooding occurred from [[Mablethorpe]] to [[Skegness]], reaching as far as {{convert|2|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} inland. Police Officers Charles Lewis and Leonard Deptford received [[George Medal]]s for their part in rescue work; Charles Lewis leapt from the Police Station upper window to save an elderly couple being swept away in the {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} floodwater, carrying them to a house across the road to safety, then continuing rescue work for several hours until he found a working telephone to call for help. Leonard Deptford was off-duty at his son's party when the wall of water hit. He realised the elderly were vulnerable as the Roman bank was breached and he dragged and carried many to safety. At one house he found a bedridden elderly couple with their middle-aged daughter; in the waist-high floodwater he lashed together oil cans to make a raft, to which he tied the couple and pulled them to safety. He carried on until the next day, his last rescue a dog.\n\nIn individual incidents, 41 died at [[Felixstowe]] in Suffolk when wooden [[prefabrication|prefabricated homes]] in the West End area of the town were flooded.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Disaster victims to be remembered on floods tragedy anniversary| journal = Ipswich Star | url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/details-of-anniversary-events-for-1953-floods-at-felixstowe-revealed-1-5343107|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> In [[Essex]], [[Canvey Island]] was inundated, with the loss of 58 lives.

Near [[Ostend]], [[Knokke]] and [[Antwerp]], heavy damage was done to the sea defence with local breaches. Twenty-eight people died, including noted Belgian musician Robert Dubois.\n\n== Responses ==\nAfter the 1953 flood, governments realised that similar infrequent but devastating events were possible in the future. In the Netherlands the government conceived and constructed an ambitious flood defence system beginning in the 1960s. Called the [[Delta Works]] ({{lang-nl|Deltawerken}}), it is designed to protect the estuaries of the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]]. The system was completed in 1998, with completion of the storm surge barrier [[Maeslantkering]] in the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]], near [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the UK, the [[Permanent Secretary]] to the [[Home Office]], Sir [[Frank Newsam]], coordinated the immediate efforts to defend homes, save lives and recover after the floods. After the flooding, the government made major investments in new sea defences. The [[Thames Barrier]] programme was started to secure Central London against a future storm surge; the Barrier was officially opened on 8 May 1984. A range of flood defence measures were initiated around the UK coast.\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn 2013 a [[Church service|service]] was held at [[Chelmsford Cathedral]] to mark the 60th anniversary of the Great Flood, attended by [[Anne, Princess Royal]].

The floods struck the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nA combination of a high [[spring tide]] and a severe [[European windstorm]] over the [[North Sea]] caused a [[storm tide of the North Sea|storm tide]]; the combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure led to a water level of more than {{convert|5.6|m|ft|1}} above mean sea level in some locations. The flood and waves overwhelmed sea defences and caused extensive flooding. The [[Netherlands]], a country with 20% of its territory below [[mean sea level]] and 50% less than {{convert|1|m|ft|1}} above sea level and which relies heavily on sea defences, was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage. Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of [[Zeeland]]. In England, 307 people were killed in the [[county (England)|counties]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]]. Nineteen were killed in Scotland. Twenty-eight people were killed in [[West Flanders]], Belgium.\n\nIn addition, more than 230 deaths occurred on water craft along [[Northern Europe]]an coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea. The ferry [[MV Princess Victoria|MV ''Princess Victoria'']] was lost at sea in the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] east of [[Belfast]] with 133 fatalities, and many [[fishing trawlers]] sank.\n\nRealising that such infrequent events could reoccur, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom carried out major studies on strengthening of coastal defences. The Netherlands developed the [[Delta Works]], an extensive system of dams and [[storm surge barrier]]s. The UK constructed storm surge barriers on the [[River Thames]] below London and on the [[River Hull]] where it meets the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n== Netherlands ==\n{{external media\n| float  =\n| width  =\n| video1 = \"Eerste beelden van de stormramp\" [First images of the storm] parts [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80035/false/true 1], [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80034/false/true 2] & [http://in.beeldengeluid.nl/collectie/details/expressie/80033/false/true 3] \u2013 ''[[Polygoon (newsreel)|Polygoon]]'' newsreel, 1\u20132 February 1953.

On both the islands and the mainland, large areas of the country were flooded. Many people still commemorate the dead on 1 February. In Dutch history and culture this flood has been named ''\"de Watersnoodramp\"''.\n\n=== Warnings ===\nThe [[Rijkswaterstaat]] had warned about the risk of a flood.<ref name=\"ley196110\">{{cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |author= |last2= |first2= |date=October 1961 |title=The Home-Made Land |department=For Your Information |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v19n06_1961-08#page/n65/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=92\u2013106 |type= }}</ref> At the time of the flood, none of the local radio stations broadcast at night, and many of the smaller [[weather station]]s operated only during the day. As a result, the warnings of the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) did not penetrate the flood-threatened area in time. People were unable to prepare for the impending flood. The disaster struck on a Saturday night, and hence many government and emergency offices in the affected area were not staffed.\n\nAs telephone and [[telegraph]] networks were disrupted by flood damage, [[amateur radio operator]]s went into the affected areas with their equipment to form a voluntary emergency radio network. These radio amateurs provided radio communications for 10 days and nights, and were the only people able to maintain contact from affected areas with the outside world.<ref>{{cite document |title=Amateur radio emergency network during 1953 flood \u2013 IEEE Xplore Document |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.825908 }}</ref>\n\n=== Resulting damage ===\n[[File:North Sea flood of 1953.png|thumb|left|Extent of flooding in the Netherlands]]\n\nThe Zeeland dikes were breached in 67 locations.{{r|ley196110}} Large parts of South Holland, Zeeland and North Brabant were inundated. In [[North Holland]] only one [[polder]] was flooded. The most extensive flooding occurred on the islands of [[Schouwen-Duiveland]], [[Tholen]], [[Sint Philipsland (island)|Sint Philipsland]], [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], the [[Hoeksche Waard]], [[Voorne-Putten]] and [[Alblasserwaard]]. Parts of the islands of [[Zuid-Beveland]], [[Noord-Beveland]], [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]], [[Pernis (Netherlands)|Pernis]], [[Rozenburg]], [[Walcheren]] and [[Land van Altena]] were flooded, as well as parts of the areas around [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]], [[Nieuw-Vossemeer]] and parts of [[Zeelandic Flanders]].\n\nThe highest death tolls were recorded on the islands of [[Schouwen-Duiveland]] and [[Goeree-Overflakkee]].\n\nAfterward, the government formed the Delta Commission to study the causes and effects of the floods. They estimated that flooding killed 1,835&nbsp;people and forced the [[emergency evacuation]] of 70,000 more. Floods covered 9% of Dutch [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]], and sea water flooded {{cvt|1,365|km\u00b2}} of land. An estimated 30,000 animals drowned, and 47,300 buildings were damaged, of which 10,000 were destroyed. The total damage is estimated at 1 billion [[Dutch guilders]].\n\n[[File:Sturmflut 1953 2.jpg|thumb|''Een [[dubbeltje]] op zijn kant''\" (\"A dubbeltje (small coin) on its edge\", meaning \"A narrow escape\"), a sculpture by Roel Bendijk of ''de Twee Gebroeders'' in the Groenedijk]]\n\n==== Near flooding of other parts ====\nThe [[Schielands Hoge Zeedijk]] (Schielands High Seadyke) along the river [[Hollandse IJssel]] was all that protected three million people in the provinces of [[South Holland|South]] and [[North Holland]] from flooding. A section of this dyke, known as the Groenendijk, was not reinforced with stone [[revetment]]s. The water level was just below the crest and the seaward slope was weak.\n\nVolunteers worked to reinforce this stretch. However, the Groenendijk began to collapse under the pressure around 5:30 am on 1 February. Seawater flooded into the deep polder. In desperation, the [[mayor]] of [[Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel|Nieuwerkerk]] commandeered the river ship ''de Twee Gebroeders'' (''The Two Brothers'') and ordered the owner to plug the hole in the dyke by navigating the ship into it. Fearing that the ship might break through into the [[polder]], Captain Arie Evegroen took a [[row boat]] with him. The mayor's plan was successful, as the ship was lodged firmly into the dyke, reinforcing it against failure and saving many lives.\n\nThe [[Afsluitdijk]] across the entrance of the [[Zuiderzee]] was said to have paid for its construction cost in that one night, by preventing destructive flooding around the Zuiderzee.\n\n=== Reaction ===\nSeveral neighbouring countries sent soldiers to assist in searching for bodies and rescuing people. The [[U.S. Army]] sent helicopters from Germany to rescue people from rooftops. [[Queen Juliana]] and [[Princess Beatrix]] visited the flooded area only a few days after. A large aid program - the National Relief Fund came on apace, supported by the radio and soldiers raised funds by selling pea-soup door to door. Internationally, 100,000 commemorative postcards, featuring an illustration by [[Eppo Doeve]], were sold.<ref name=\"europeana\"/> A national donation program was started and there was a large amount of international aid. The [[Red Cross]] \nwas overwhelmed by contributions, and decided to divert some of the funds to assist residents of Third World countries.\n\nIt was found that the flooding could have been {{convert|4|feet}} higher; the Rijkswaterstaat's plan concerning the protection and strengthening of the dikes was accepted. {{r|ley196110}} As a result, the [[Delta Works]] were authorized, an elaborate project to enable emergency closing of the mouths of most [[estuary|estuaries]], to prevent flood surges upriver.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:TB 1953 1.jpg|thumb|A breach at [[Erith]] after the 1953 flood]]\nThe North Sea flood of 1953 was one of the most devastating natural disasters ever recorded in the [[United Kingdom]].

In Lincolnshire, flooding occurred from [[Mablethorpe]] to [[Skegness]], reaching as far as {{convert|2|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} inland. Police Officers Charles Lewis and Leonard Deptford received [[George Medal]]s for their part in rescue work; Charles Lewis leapt from the Police Station upper window to save an elderly couple being swept away in the {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} floodwater, carrying them to a house across the road to safety, then continuing rescue work for several hours until he found a working telephone to call for help. Leonard Deptford was off-duty at his son's party when the wall of water hit. He realised the elderly were vulnerable as the Roman bank was breached and he dragged and carried many to safety. At one house he found a bedridden elderly couple with their middle-aged daughter; in the waist-high floodwater he lashed together oil cans to make a raft, to which he tied the couple and pulled them to safety. He carried on until the next day, his last rescue a dog.\n\nIn individual incidents, 41 died at [[Felixstowe]] in Suffolk when wooden [[prefabrication|prefabricated homes]] in the West End area of the town were flooded.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Disaster victims to be remembered on floods tragedy anniversary| journal = Ipswich Star | url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/details-of-anniversary-events-for-1953-floods-at-felixstowe-revealed-1-5343107|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> In [[Essex]], [[Canvey Island]] was inundated, with the loss of 58 lives.

Near [[Ostend]], [[Knokke]] and [[Antwerp]], heavy damage was done to the sea defence with local breaches. Twenty-eight people died, including noted Belgian musician Robert Dubois.\n\n== Responses ==\nAfter the 1953 flood, governments realised that similar infrequent but devastating events were possible in the future. In the Netherlands the government conceived and constructed an ambitious flood defence system beginning in the 1960s. Called the [[Delta Works]] ({{lang-nl|Deltawerken}}), it is designed to protect the estuaries of the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]]. The system was completed in 1998, with completion of the storm surge barrier [[Maeslantkering]] in the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]], near [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the UK, the [[Permanent Secretary]] to the [[Home Office]], Sir [[Frank Newsam]], coordinated the immediate efforts to defend homes, save lives and recover after the floods. After the flooding, the government made major investments in new sea defences. The [[Thames Barrier]] programme was started to secure Central London against a future storm surge; the Barrier was officially opened on 8 May 1984. A range of flood defence measures were initiated around the UK coast.\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn 2013 a [[Church service|service]] was held at [[Chelmsford Cathedral]] to mark the 60th anniversary of the Great Flood, attended by [[Anne, Princess Royal]].

Akhtar was particularly influenced by the ''[[Jasoosi Dunya]]'' and [[Imran series|''Imran'' series]] of [[detective novels]], such as ''[[The House of Fear (novel)|The House of Fear]]'' (1955). He was influenced by their fast action, tight plots, economies of expression, fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, and speaking styles. Two of the earliest films he remembered watching both starred [[Dilip Kumar]]: [[Shaheed Latif]]'s ''[[Arzoo (1950 film)|Arzoo]]'' (1950) and [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). Other films that influenced him as a child include [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Do Bigha Zameen]]'' (1953), [[Satyen Bose]]'s ''[[Jagriti]]'' (1954), ''[[Shree 420]]'' (1955) directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] and written by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955) directed by [[Subodh Mukherjee]] and written by [[Nasir Hussain]], and Mehboob Khan's ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Diptakirti |title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema's Greatest Screenwriters |date=2015 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9789352140084 |pages=26\u201327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1971\u20131982===\n\n{{main|Salim-Javed}}\n\nInitially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles.

Akhtar was particularly influenced by the ''[[Jasoosi Dunya]]'' and [[Imran series|''Imran'' series]] of [[detective novels]], such as ''[[The House of Fear (novel)|The House of Fear]]'' (1955). He was influenced by their fast action, tight plots, economies of expression, fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, and speaking styles. Two of the earliest films he remembered watching both starred [[Dilip Kumar]]: [[Shaheed Latif]]'s ''[[Arzoo (1950 film)|Arzoo]]'' (1950) and [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). Other films that influenced him as a child include [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Do Bigha Zameen]]'' (1953), [[Satyen Bose]]'s ''[[Jagriti]]'' (1954), ''[[Shree 420]]'' (1955) directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] and written by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955) directed by [[Subodh Mukherjee]] and written by [[Nasir Hussain]], and Mehboob Khan's ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Diptakirti |title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema's Greatest Screenwriters |date=2015 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9789352140084 |pages=26\u201327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1971\u20131982===\n\n{{main|Salim-Javed}}\n\nInitially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles.

They also had hits with ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973), ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''Haath Ki Safai'' (1974), ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), ''Chacha Bhatija'' (1977), ''Don'' (1978), ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), ''Dostana'' (1980), ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), ''[[Zamana (1985 film)|Zamana]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films \u2013 ''[[Premada Kanike]]'' and ''[[Raja Nanna Raja]]''. Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include ''Aakhri Dao'' (1975), ''Immaan Dharam'' (1977), ''Kaala Patthar'' (1979) and ''Shaan'' (1980).
