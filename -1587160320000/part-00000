The [[river dolphin|other five species]], including the [[boto]] and the [[La Plata dolphin]], have survived in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Amazon river|Amazon]] rivers in South America and the [[Ganges]] and [[Indus]] rivers on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary ''[[Erya]]'' circa 3rd century BC.\n\nIt is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, ''Platanista'' and ''Lipotes'' + (''Inia'' + ''Pontoporia''), having no sister relationship with each other, and the ''Platanista'' lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the ''Platanista'' is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The ''Lipotes'' has a sister relationship with ''Inia + pontoporia'', and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based\non short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = K. | last3 = Gaung | first3 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = Molecular phylogenetics of 'river dolphins' and the baiji mitochondrial genome | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 743\u2013750 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.06.009| pmid = 16046150}}</ref>\n\nLow values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River.

Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into PSGs in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including [[microcephaly]]. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much of the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.<ref name=\"Zhou\">{{Cite journal|title = Baiji genomes reveal low genetic variability and new insights into secondary aquatic adaptations|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2013-10-29|pmc = 3826649|pmid = 24169659|volume = 4|pages = 2708|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3708|first = Xuming|last = Zhou|first2 = Fengming|last2 = Sun|first3 = Shixia|last3 = Xu|first4 = Guangyi|last4 = Fan|first5 = Kangli|last5 = Zhu|first6 = Xin|last6 = Liu|first7 = Yuan|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chengcheng|last8 = Shi|first9 = Yunxia|last9 = Yang|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2708Z}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n\n== Folklore ==\nPer Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze.

However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets ([[gill nets]] and [[fyke]] nets) and [[electrofishing]]; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was\nthe victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Turvey, S.T. |author2=Rovbert, P.L. |author3=Taylor, B.L. |author4=Barlow, J. |author5=Akamatsu, T. |author6=Barrett, L.A. |author7=Zhao, X. |author8=Reeves, R.

In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to [[bycatch|entanglement]] in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered \"the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival\".<ref name=\"iucn\" /> Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.\n\nThere are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by parasitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in [[epizootic]]s, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had [[Helminthiasis|helminth]] infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = S | last2 = Ju | first2 = J | last3 = Zhou | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = L | last5 = Zhou | first5 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Considerable MHC Diversity Suggests That the Functional Extinction of Baiji Is Not Related to Population Genetic Collapse | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = e30423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030423 | pmid=22272349 | pmc=3260281| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730423X }}</ref>\n\nIt has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji.

The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.\n\nIn 1978, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (\u6de1\u6c34\u6d77\u8c5a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3) as a branch of the [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of [[Wuhan]] (\u6b66\u6c49\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u91d1), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 [[Renminbi|CNY]] (about {{US$|link=yes}}100,000) and used the funds for [[in vitro]] cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.\n\n[[Image:Baiji conservation efforts map.png|thumb|right|350px|Conservation efforts of the baiji along the Yangtze River]]\nSince 1992, five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves ([[Shishou|Shishou City]] and Xin-Luo) and two provincial ([[Tongling]] and [[Zhenjiang]]). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been\nestablished along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and\nillegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction\nof these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken\nin the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided, the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conservationists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the [[finless porpoise]], to breed. Through careful management, both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduce successfully enough to\nprovide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = K. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | last4 = Pfluger | first4 = A. | last5 = Barrett | first5 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Range-wide Yangtze freshwater dolphin expedition: The last chance to see Baiji''?'' | url = http://ir.ihb.ac.cn/handle/152342/8782| journal = Environmental Science and Pollution Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 418\u2013424 | doi=10.1065/espr2006.10.350| pmid = 17120833 }}</ref>\n\nThe fifth protected area is an isolated [[oxbow lake]] located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve|Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve]].

From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze [[finless porpoise]]. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the island within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nThe success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |title=Responsible Ecotourism at Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve |publisher=baiji.org |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617043837/http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve.

This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed.

Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carwardine | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = The baiji: So long and thanks for all the fish | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 195 | issue = 2621| pages = 50\u201353 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)62350-1}}</ref> The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (\u6dc7\u6dc7) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology [[dolphinarium]] from 1980 to July 14, 2002.

The [[river dolphin|other five species]], including the [[boto]] and the [[La Plata dolphin]], have survived in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Amazon river|Amazon]] rivers in South America and the [[Ganges]] and [[Indus]] rivers on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary ''[[Erya]]'' circa 3rd century BC.\n\nIt is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, ''Platanista'' and ''Lipotes'' + (''Inia'' + ''Pontoporia''), having no sister relationship with each other, and the ''Platanista'' lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the ''Platanista'' is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The ''Lipotes'' has a sister relationship with ''Inia + pontoporia'', and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based\non short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = K. | last3 = Gaung | first3 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = Molecular phylogenetics of 'river dolphins' and the baiji mitochondrial genome | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 743\u2013750 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.06.009| pmid = 16046150}}</ref>\n\nLow values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a high level of overall genetic structure.

Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into PSGs in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including [[microcephaly]]. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much of the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.<ref name=\"Zhou\">{{Cite journal|title = Baiji genomes reveal low genetic variability and new insights into secondary aquatic adaptations|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2013-10-29|pmc = 3826649|pmid = 24169659|volume = 4|pages = 2708|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3708|first = Xuming|last = Zhou|first2 = Fengming|last2 = Sun|first3 = Shixia|last3 = Xu|first4 = Guangyi|last4 = Fan|first5 = Kangli|last5 = Zhu|first6 = Xin|last6 = Liu|first7 = Yuan|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chengcheng|last8 = Shi|first9 = Yunxia|last9 = Yang|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2708Z}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n\n== Folklore ==\nPer Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze. He was evil, and a greedy man out for his own self-interest. One day, he took the girl on a boat, intending to sell her on the market. Out on the river, though, he became infatuated with her beauty and tried to take advantage of her. But she freed herself by plunging into the river whereupon a big storm came and sank the boat.

However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets ([[gill nets]] and [[fyke]] nets) and [[electrofishing]]; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was\nthe victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Turvey, S.T. |author2=Rovbert, P.L. |author3=Taylor, B.L. |author4=Barlow, J. |author5=Akamatsu, T. |author6=Barrett, L.A. |author7=Zhao, X. |author8=Reeves, R.

In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to [[bycatch|entanglement]] in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered \"the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival\".<ref name=\"iucn\" /> Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.\n\nThere are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by parasitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in [[epizootic]]s, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had [[Helminthiasis|helminth]] infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = S | last2 = Ju | first2 = J | last3 = Zhou | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = L | last5 = Zhou | first5 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Considerable MHC Diversity Suggests That the Functional Extinction of Baiji Is Not Related to Population Genetic Collapse | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = e30423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030423 | pmid=22272349 | pmc=3260281| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730423X }}</ref>\n\nIt has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji.

The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.\n\nIn 1978, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (\u6de1\u6c34\u6d77\u8c5a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3) as a branch of the [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of [[Wuhan]] (\u6b66\u6c49\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u91d1), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 [[Renminbi|CNY]] (about {{US$|link=yes}}100,000) and used the funds for [[in vitro]] cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.\n\n[[Image:Baiji conservation efforts map.png|thumb|right|350px|Conservation efforts of the baiji along the Yangtze River]]\nSince 1992, five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves ([[Shishou|Shishou City]] and Xin-Luo) and two provincial ([[Tongling]] and [[Zhenjiang]]). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been\nestablished along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and\nillegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction\nof these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken\nin the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided, the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conservationists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the [[finless porpoise]], to breed. Through careful management, both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduce successfully enough to\nprovide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = K. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | last4 = Pfluger | first4 = A. | last5 = Barrett | first5 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Range-wide Yangtze freshwater dolphin expedition: The last chance to see Baiji''?'' | url = http://ir.ihb.ac.cn/handle/152342/8782| journal = Environmental Science and Pollution Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 418\u2013424 | doi=10.1065/espr2006.10.350| pmid = 17120833 }}</ref>\n\nThe fifth protected area is an isolated [[oxbow lake]] located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve|Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve]].

This plan re-emphasised the three measures identified at the 1986 workshop and was adopted as the national policy for the conservation of the Baiji. Despite all of these workshops and conventions little money was available in China to aid the conservation efforts. It has been estimated that US$1 million was needed to begin the project and maintain it for a further 3 years.<ref name=ZSL>{{cite web|url=http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |title=Conservation of the Yangtze River Dolphin: Emergency Implementation Meeting |accessdate=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619235441/http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nEfforts to save the mammals proved to be too little and too late.

The deterioration of the Yangtze River had to be reversed to preserve the habitat. The ex-situ projects aimed to raise a large enough population over time so that some, if not all, of the dolphins could be returned to the Yangtze, so the habitat within the river had to be maintained anyway.\n\n====Ex-situ conservation====\nThe Shishou Tian-e-Zhou is a {{convert|21|km|mi|adj=on}} long, {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} wide [[oxbow lake]] located near Shishou City in Hubei Province. Shishou has been described as being \"like a miniature Yangtze&nbsp;... possessing all of the requirements for a semi-natural reserve\". From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze [[finless porpoise]]. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the island within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nThe success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |title=Responsible Ecotourism at Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve |publisher=baiji.org |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617043837/http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve. The necessary infrastructure does not currently exist to realize these opportunities.\n\n====Captive specimens====\nA baiji conservation [[dolphinarium]] was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large ({{convert|25|m}} arc [kidney shaped] &times; {{convert|7|m}} wide &times; {{convert|3.5|m}} deep, {{convert|10|m}} diameter, {{convert|2|m}} deep and {{convert|12|m}} diameter, {{convert|3.5|m}} deep) and so are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carwardine | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = The baiji: So long and thanks for all the fish | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 195 | issue = 2621| pages = 50\u201353 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)62350-1}}</ref> The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (\u6dc7\u6dc7) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology [[dolphinarium]] from 1980 to July 14, 2002.

He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and in 1859 matriculated to [[Oxford University]] as a commoner of [[Brasenose College]].<ref>Brasenose College Register 1509\u20131909 (Blackwell, 1909, p. 579)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Walter Bradford Woodgate]], a contemporary at Brasenose with Grissell and the founder of [[Vincent's Club]] (of which Grissell was a member), he was 'a non-athlete, but ... popular'.<ref>J. Mordaunt Crook, Brasenose: The Biography of an Oxford College (Oxford University Press, 2008, p257)</ref> During his time at University Grissell came under the influence of the leading tractarian, Dr. [[Henry Parry Liddon]]. He became increasingly involved with the Anglican High Church movement and was admitted to the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, a movement existing to promote [[High Church]] principles within the University.\n\n==Conversion==\nIt was at also Oxford that Grissell developed a strong interest in ecclesiastical ritual. He came to believe that the [[Book of Common Prayer]] had its roots in the Catholic liturgy and argued for greater ritualism in Anglican worship. In 1865 he published a work called 'Ritual Inaccuracies', in which he attempted to 'bring the rubrics of the Protestant Communion Service into line with those of the [[Roman Missal]]'.<ref>Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Ritual Inaccuracies (J. Masters & Co, 1865)</ref> Reminiscing about this period of his life he was to write:  \n<blockquote>\nI soon came to the conclusion myself that this exhumation of scraps and snatches of an ancient rite, and the profane distortion of the rubrics of the [[Roman Missal]] for the disguise of Protestant worship was little better than an imposture.<ref>'Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Esq, MA, Brasenose College, Oxford' in J.

Under the direction of Fr. [[Edward Caswall]], a priest of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], Grissell began to read Catholic works. Writing in the year of his death, he recalled his conversion:\n<blockquote>\nI came, after careful study of the question, to the conclusion that the Church of England, being purely a national Church, could hardly be considered Catholic and universal, in the sense of its being the Divine teacher of all nations, and that it was in schism \u2026 Prayer at length obtained for me the inestimable happiness of submitting myself to the Church, and of obtaining thereby the full certitude of my possessing undoubted and valid sacraments, and the enjoyment of that peace on earth which the true old faith can alone assure.<ref>'Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Esq, MA, Brasenose College, Oxford' in J.

The Cameriere wore a Spanish-style costume with cape and sword and had the duty of attending upon the Pope during ecclesiastical and state functions. With his love of ritual Grissell relished life in the Papal Court, and writing in later life he reminisced:\n<blockquote>\nHaving had the privilege for a period of some thirty-five years of being Chamberlain to three successive Pontiffs, [I have] many diaries \u2026 These many interesting reminiscences include an [[\u0152cumenical Council]], four Jubilees, three [[Canonization]]s, two Papal Consecrations of Bishops, many [[Papal consistory|Consistories]] (including those at which Cardinals Manning, Howard, and Newman received their hats), a Blessing of the [[Golden Rose]], and of the Ducal Sword and Cap, an 'Anno Santo,' two [[Conclaves]], and two Coronations, as well as many pilgrimages and visits of Sovereigns to His Holiness.<ref>Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Sede Vacante, being a Diary written during the Conclave of 1903, with additional Notes on the Accession and Coronation of Pius X (James Parker & Co, 1903).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe temporal power of the Pope came to an end in 1870, when [[Victor Emmanuel II]] seized Rome, but Grissell nonetheless continued to serve under [[Pius IX]] and his two immediate successors, [[Leo XIII]] and St. [[Pius X]]. He was rewarded for his service, being created a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] and, in 1898, one of the four [[Papal Chamberlain]]s 'di numero' (an honour usually reserved to the Roman nobility).  Writing from Rome in 1900 [[Oscar Wilde]] referred to Grissell as a stalwart of the conservative Papal Court:\n<blockquote>\nWe came to Rome on Holy Thursday ... and yesterday, to the terror of Grissell and all the Papal Court, I appeared in the front rank of the pilgrims in the Vatican, and got the blessing of the Holy Father \u2013 a blessing they would have denied me.\nHe was wonderful as he was carried past me on his throne\u2014not of flesh and blood, but a white soul robed in white and an artist as well as a saint-the only instance in history, if the newspapers are to be believed.

The centrepiece of the collection was the reputedly miraculous image of the Madonna called 'Mater Misericordia' (now housed in the [[Oxford Oratory]] and popularly known as 'Our Lady of Oxford'), to which [[Pius IX]] granted indulgences at Grissell's request. Besides being an expert in matters liturgical, Grissell was a noted numismatician and was elected to a fellowship of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].<ref>John Evans, Numismatic Chronicle and Journal of the Royal Numismatic Society Vol VII (Read Books, 2006, p.35)</ref>\n\n==Newman Society==\n\n[[File:Founders of the Oxford University Newman Society (1878).jpg|thumb|280px|The founders of the Newman Society outside St. Aloysius' Church, Oxford, 1878; standing, second-from-right, Gerard Manley Hopkins, fourth-from right, Grissell]]When not serving at the Papal Court, Grissell resided at 60 High Street in Oxford.

He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and in 1859 matriculated to [[Oxford University]] as a commoner of [[Brasenose College]].<ref>Brasenose College Register 1509\u20131909 (Blackwell, 1909, p. 579)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Walter Bradford Woodgate]], a contemporary at Brasenose with Grissell and the founder of [[Vincent's Club]] (of which Grissell was a member), he was 'a non-athlete, but ... popular'.<ref>J. Mordaunt Crook, Brasenose: The Biography of an Oxford College (Oxford University Press, 2008, p257)</ref> During his time at University Grissell came under the influence of the leading tractarian, Dr. [[Henry Parry Liddon]]. He became increasingly involved with the Anglican High Church movement and was admitted to the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, a movement existing to promote [[High Church]] principles within the University.\n\n==Conversion==\nIt was at also Oxford that Grissell developed a strong interest in ecclesiastical ritual. He came to believe that the [[Book of Common Prayer]] had its roots in the Catholic liturgy and argued for greater ritualism in Anglican worship. In 1865 he published a work called 'Ritual Inaccuracies', in which he attempted to 'bring the rubrics of the Protestant Communion Service into line with those of the [[Roman Missal]]'.<ref>Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Ritual Inaccuracies (J. Masters & Co, 1865)</ref> Reminiscing about this period of his life he was to write:  \n<blockquote>\nI soon came to the conclusion myself that this exhumation of scraps and snatches of an ancient rite, and the profane distortion of the rubrics of the [[Roman Missal]] for the disguise of Protestant worship was little better than an imposture.<ref>'Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, Esq, MA, Brasenose College, Oxford' in J.

He was joined by Jaroslav Barto\u0148, also from Citron, Daniel Krob ([[Arakain]]), Robert Vondrovic (Arakain), and Karel Adam (Moped).\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn 1990, Kreyson recorded their debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the run) in a studio in [[Hanover]] with producer Jan N\u011bmec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/biography.php?band_id=5114&bandname=Kreyson |title=Kreyson Biography |publisher=metalstorm.net |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Its initial pressing of 45,000 copies sold out within three days. The album went [[Music recording certification|gold]] after selling 150,000 copies and eventually sold over a quarter of a million copies. Three singles were released off the album: \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far away, or \"Faraway\" on the English version), \"\u010carovn\u00e1 noc\" (Magical night, or \"Deep in the Night\" on the English version), and \"Nejde vr\u00e1tit \u010das\" (Can't turn back time, or \"I Need You\" on the English version), all of which were successful in the charts. An English version of the album, titled ''Angel on the Run'', came out the same year. Upon the success of Kreyson's first album, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden boy), in 1991. The rest of the band accompanied him on this record as well, though by this point Robert Vondrovic had been replaced by Daniel Hafstein (Motorband) and Libor Matej\u010d\u00edk (Motorband) took over guitar duties from Daniel Krob a year later.\n\n==Subsequent albums and hiatus==\nIn 1992, Kreyson released their second studio album, titled ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders). The record saw a shift towards faster, more speed-metal oriented tracks. As with ''Angel on the Run'', an English version of this album was released, titled ''Crusaders''. This album also attained gold status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Kreyson+&+Ladislav+K%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEek/+wiki |title=Kreyson and Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek Bio |publisher=last.fm |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n1993 saw the release of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's second solo album, ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (Key to my soul), and Kreyson's third studio album, ''Elix\u00edr \u017eivota'' (Elixir of life). This record didn't prove to be as successful as the band's previous two efforts, though it didn't fare poorly either. Jaroslav Barto\u0148 played only a few solos on the album, and the majority of the guitar tracks were recorded by Petr Henych.\n\nThe band's next effort, ''Z\u00e1kon d\u017eungle'' (Law of the jungle) was released in 1995, though by this point they were no longer signed to Tomm\u00fc Records, which had released their previous albums. A follow-up album was planned, but it never materialized and the band subsequently went on a 10-year hiatus after issuing a compilation album titled ''The best of'', in 1996.\n\n==Return==\nDuring this time, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek continued touring, working on solo material, as well as taking part in other musical projects. In 2006, in anticipation of bringing Kreyson back, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek launched a contest to select new band members. This culminated in a new lineup consisting of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek on vocals, Jaroslav Barto\u0148 returning on lead guitar, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek on third guitar (a first for a Czech metal band), Lud\u011bk Ad\u00e1mek on bass (Ad\u00e1mek had briefly played with the band in 1993), and Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd on drums.\nThe band played a pre-launch show on March 17, 2007, which was broadcast live on Czech television from Ostrava's [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na|\u010cEZ Ar\u00e9na]], during which they were joined on stage by Germany's [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]]. In June 2007, Kreyson filmed their first live album, titled ''Kreyson \u2013 T\u0159inec live'', at the ''Noc Pln\u00e1 Hv\u011bzd'' (Star-studded night) international music festival in [[T\u0159inec]]. They followed this with a successful tour of Czechia, Germany, and Switzerland in December 2007, together with Doro. Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek left the band around this time.\n\nKreyson began recording their fifth studio album, ''N\u00e1vrat kr\u00e1le'' (Return of the king), in the spring of 2011. Two singles were released before funds ran out and recording stopped. A new drummer also had to be found after Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd left, and Michal Dan\u011bk joined the band. With help from sponsors, Kreyson got the opportunity to continue the recording abroad, and they set out for [[Andy LaRocque]]'s ([[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]]) studio in [[Varberg]], [[Sweden]] in 2013. The entire album was thus recorded in LaRocque's Sonic Train Studios, and the artwork for it was done by famed English illustrator [[Mark Wilkinson]] ([[Marillion]], [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]]). The album was released in October 2013, and subsequently gained gold status.\n\n==Kreyson Memorial==\nIn 2016, Kreyson founding member and former guitarist Daniel Krob reached out to a few of his previous bandmates with the idea of a tour commemorating 25 years since the release of the band's debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku''. The eventual lineup of this live act would be Krob on guitar, Robert Vondrovic on drums, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Petr \"Doldy\" Dol\u00e9nek on vocals, Stanislav \"Jokki\" Jokiel on bass, and Marek \"Elrin\" Svoboda on keyboards. Other former members of Kreyson were set to join the band on stage, including Jaroslav Barto\u0148 and Karel Adam. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was also approached with the offer of joining but declined, citing his renewed commitment to the band Citron. The ensemble, going by the name Kreyson Memorial, began playing shows, and in 2019 they released their first album, a set of original tracks titled ''Str\u00e1\u017eci plamen\u016f'' (Guardians of the flames).

He was joined by Jaroslav Barto\u0148, also from Citron, Daniel Krob (Arakain), Robert Vondrovic (Arakain), and Karel Adam (Moped).\n\n== Beginnings ==\nIn 1990, Kreyson recorded their debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the run) in a studio in [[Hanover]] with producer Jan N\u011bmec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/biography.php?band_id=5114&bandname=Kreyson |title=Kreyson Biography |publisher=metalstorm.net |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref> Its initial pressing of 45,000 copies sold out within three days. The album went [[Music recording certification|gold]] after selling 150,000 copies and eventually sold over a quarter of a million copies. Three singles were released off the album: \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far away, or \"Faraway\" on the English version), \"\u010carovn\u00e1 noc\" (Magical night, or \"Deep in the Night\" on the English version), and \"Nejde vr\u00e1tit \u010das\" (Can't turn back time, or \"I Need You\" on the English version), all of which were successful in the charts. An English version of the album, titled ''Angel on the Run'', came out the same year. Upon the success of Kreyson's first album, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden boy), in 1991. The rest of the band accompanied him on this record as well, though by this point Robert Vondrovic had been replaced by Daniel Hafstein (Motorband) and Libor Matej\u010d\u00edk (Motorband) took over guitar duties from Daniel Krob a year later.\n\n== Subsequent albums and hiatus ==\nIn 1992, Kreyson released their second studio album, titled ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders). The record saw a shift towards faster, more speed-metal oriented tracks. As with ''Angel on the Run'', an English version of this album was released, titled ''Crusaders''. This album also attained gold status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Kreyson+&+Ladislav+K%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEek/+wiki |title=Kreyson and Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek Bio |publisher=last.fm |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n1993 saw the release of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's second solo album, ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (Key to my soul), and Kreyson's third studio album, ''Elix\u00edr \u017eivota'' (Elixir of life). This record didn't prove to be as successful as the band's previous two efforts, though it didn't fare poorly either. Jaroslav Barto\u0148 played only a few solos on the album, and the majority of the guitar tracks were recorded by Petr Henych.\n\nThe band's next effort, ''Z\u00e1kon d\u017eungle'' (Law of the jungle) was released in 1995, though by this point they were no longer signed to Tomm\u00fc Records, which had released their previous albums. A follow-up album was planned, but it never materialized and the band subsequently went on a 10-year hiatus after issuing a compilation album titled ''The best of'', in 1996.\n\n== Return ==\nDuring this time, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek continued touring, working on solo material, as well as taking part in other musical projects. In 2006, in anticipation of bringing Kreyson back, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek launched a contest to select new band members. This culminated in a new lineup consisting of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek on vocals, Jaroslav Barto\u0148 returning on lead guitar, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek on third guitar (a first for a Czech metal band), Lud\u011bk Ad\u00e1mek on bass (Ad\u00e1mek had briefly played with the band in 1993), and Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd on drums.\nThe band played a pre-launch show on March 17, 2007, which was broadcast live on Czech television from Ostrava's [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na|\u010cEZ Ar\u00e9na]], during which they were joined on stage by Germany's [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]]. In June 2007, Kreyson filmed their first live album, titled ''Kreyson \u2013 T\u0159inec live'', at the ''Noc Pln\u00e1 Hv\u011bzd'' (Star-studded night) international music festival in [[T\u0159inec]]. They followed this with a successful tour of Czechia, Germany, and Switzerland in December 2007, together with Doro. Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek left the band around this time.\n\nKreyson began recording their fifth studio album, ''N\u00e1vrat kr\u00e1le'' (Return of the king), in the spring of 2011. Two singles were released before funds ran out and recording stopped. A new drummer also had to be found after Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd left, and Michal Dan\u011bk joined the band. With help from sponsors, Kreyson got the opportunity to continue the recording abroad, and they set out for [[Andy LaRocque]]'s ([[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]]) studio in [[Varberg]], [[Sweden]] in 2013. The entire album was thus recorded in LaRocque's Sonic Train Studios, and the artwork for it was done by famed English illustrator [[Mark Wilkinson]] ([[Marillion]], [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]]). The album was released in October 2013, and subsequently gained gold status.\n\n== Kreyson Memorial ==\nIn 2016, Kreyson founding member and former guitarist Daniel Krob reached out to a few of his previous bandmates with the idea of a tour commemorating 25 years since the release of the band's debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku''. The eventual lineup of this live act would be Krob on guitar, Robert Vondrovic on drums, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Petr \"Doldy\" Dol\u00e9nek on vocals, Stanislav \"Jokki\" Jokiel on bass, and Marek \"Elrin\" Svoboda on keyboards. Other former members of Kreyson were set to join the band on stage, including Jaroslav Barto\u0148 and Karel Adam. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was also approached with the offer of joining but declined, citing his renewed commitment to the band Citron. The ensemble, going by the name Kreyson Memorial, began playing shows, and in 2019 they released their first album, a set of original tracks titled ''Str\u00e1\u017eci plamen\u016f'' (Guardians of the flames). Their current lineup consists of Krob, Kroc, Vondrovic, and Dol\u00e9nek, as well as Petr Form\u00e1nek on bass.\n\n== Kreyson MMXVII ==\nIn May 2017, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced a new lineup for his band, this time with international contributions from German guitarist [[Roland Grapow]] ([[Helloween]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]) and American drummer [[Mike Terrana]] ([[Rage (German band)|Rage]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]).

The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines the city of Emporia with surrounding Greensville county for statistical purposes.\n\n==History==\n\nEmporia has long been a transportation crossroads. The [[Meherrin River]], like the Nottoway River and the Blackwater River, empties to the southeast into [[Albemarle Sound]]. The Town of '''Hicksford''' (originally Hicks'<ref name=\"nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com\">https://nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com/tag/robert-hicks/</ref> Ford) was settled by Captain Robert Hicks (1658-1739)<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Fort Christanna]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} in the [[Virginia Colony]], where the Fort Road of eastern Virginia crossed the [[Meherrin River]] en route to [[Fort Christanna]].<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/> The road was a major north-south trail used by native peoples and sometimes called the \"Halifax road\".  Capt. Hicks was an Indian trader who resided in Prince George Co. prior to moving his family to Hicksford upon becoming the Commander of Fort Christanna. (His surname is spelled both \"Hicks\" and \"Hix\" in colonial records.) In 1709, Hicks purchased a land tract of 1280 acres along the northside of the Meherrin River that has been previously surveyed by Arthur Kavanaugh.<ref name=\"nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com\"/>\n\nGreensville County separated from Brunswick county in 1781 and Hicksford became the county seat (court convening monthly at a nearby tavern). In May 1781, British Col. [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s cavalry crossed at Hicksford while raiding Greensville and Southampton counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HMCFV_tarletons-movements_Emporia-VA.html|title=Tarleton's Movements - Emporia - VA - US - Historical Marker Project|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter statehood, the Virginia General Assembly recognized the Town of '''Belfield''' on the river's northern bank in 1798, and Hicksford on the southern bank the next year.<ref>Travis C. McDonald Jr., Emporia: A Centennial Retrospective 1887-1987 (Emporia Centennial Committee 1987)</ref>\n\nIn the following decades, the surrounding area remained rural, and development in Hicksford exceeded that of Belfield. An 1847 account documented 12-20 dwellings in Hicksford worth about $10,025 and Belfield's buildings worth $3050; in 1865 Hicksford's buildings were valued at $20,700 and Belfield's at $3650.  However, by 1885 Hicksford had only grown to $22,915 while Belfield had grown to 7300.<ref>McDonald at p. 8</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the [[Petersburg Railroad]] (to Weldon), built in 1830, was a tactical prize as Union troops sought to isolate the confederate capitol. In 1857, '''Belfield''' was a stop on the [[Petersburg Railroad]].  Two battles for the control of the Weldon Railroad were fought near Petersburg during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] in [[Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road|June 1864]] and [[Battle of Globe Tavern|September 1864]]. On December 7, 1864, 28,000 Union troops led by Major General [[Gouverneur K. Warren]] tried to sever that key supply route further south by uprooting tracks, and managed to stop Confederate troops under Major General [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] from destroying the Meherrin river bridge. However, when they retreated, Confederates rebuilt the railway line.<ref name=\"historical-markers.org\">{{cite web|url=http://photos.historical-markers.org/Virginia/Greensville-County/VA-UM46-Hicksford-Raid|title=VA-UM46 Hicksford Raid|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"historical-markers.org\"/> After the war, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was leased to the [[Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad]], which went bankrupt in 1878.\n\nGreensville County native and delegate [[Benjamin D. Tillar Jr.]] (1855-1887) received a charter for the [[Atlantic and Danville Railway]], which he planned would go from [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] as had the Weldon railroad, but more westward through the Meherrin river towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markerhistory.com/benjamin-d-tillar-jr-marker-um-39|title=Benjamin D. Tillar, Jr. UM-39 - Marker History|date=1 January 1853|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> In 1887, Hicksford and Belfield merged, forming the newly [[incorporated town]] of Emporia.  It was named after the town of [[Emporia, Kansas]], home town of Tillar's friend U.S. Senator [[Preston B. Plumb]] of Kansas. However, the railroad boom proved short-lived, as poor farm conditions and the [[Panic of 1893]] caused the county's population to decrease between 1880 and 1890. The [[Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad]] also ran through Emporia.\n\nEmporia was re-chartered in 1892, and the town issued its first bonds (to establish a water plant, lighting and street improvements) in 1900. It hosted an agricultural fair in 1906, and brick buildings replaced frame structures. Banks were chartered, followed by land improvement companies and insurance companies, then various stores, automobile companies and cola bottlers.<ref>McDonald pp. 8-16</ref>\n\nThe [[Virginia General Assembly]] re-chartered the Town of Emporia as an independent city in 1967, five years after the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] purchased and reorganized the Atlantic and Danville Railway. Now, a major north-south [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railway line crosses a [[Norfolk Southern]] east-west line in Emporia. Also, [[U.S. Route 58 in Virginia|U.S. Route 58]] crosses Emporia east-west and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]] crosses north-south, so providing services for travelers continues to be important in modern Emporia.\n\nHistoric buildings in Emporia include the [[Belfield-Emporia Historic District]], [[Hicksford-Emporia Historic District]], [[Greensville County Courthouse Complex]], [[Greensville County Training School]], [[H. T. Klugel Architectural Sheet Metal Work Building]], [[Old Merchants and Farmers Bank Building]], and [[Village View (Emporia, Virginia)|Village View]], all of which are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEmporia is located at {{coord|36|41|34|N|77|32|17|W|type:city}} (36.693018, -77.53809).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.0|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|6.9|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\" /> The city is located about 65 miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], about 80 miles west of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and about 60 miles north of [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], [[North Carolina]].\n\n==Governance==\nBy circa 2015 the city and Greensville County, in a cost-saving measure, combined their local government operations.<ref name=Gabayp436>{{cite journal|author=Gabay, Barry|url=https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2016/02/Gabay-501.pdf|title=SOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND THE GREATER RICHMOND SCHOOL DISTRICT: THE FEASIBILITY OF INTERDISTRICT CONSOLIDATION|work=[[University of Richmond Law Review]]|volume=51|date=2015-10-16|pages=397\u2013438}} - page cited: 436.</ref>\nA major source of the revenue for Greensville County now comes from speeding tickets issued to out of state travelers along I-95.

The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] combines the city of Emporia with surrounding Greensville county for statistical purposes.\n\n==History==\n\nEmporia has long been a transportation crossroads. The [[Meherrin River]], like the Nottoway River and the Blackwater River, empties to the southeast into [[Albemarle Sound]]. The Town of '''Hicksford''' (originally Hicks'<ref name=\"nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com\">https://nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com/tag/robert-hicks/</ref> Ford) was settled by Captain Robert Hicks (1658-1739)<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Fort Christanna]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} in the [[Virginia Colony]], where the Fort Road of eastern Virginia crossed the [[Meherrin River]] en route to [[Fort Christanna]].<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/> The road was a major north-south trail used by native peoples and sometimes called the \"Halifax road\".  Capt. Hicks was an Indian trader who resided in Prince George Co. prior to moving his family to Hicksford upon becoming the Commander of Fort Christanna. (His surname is spelled both \"Hicks\" and \"Hix\" in colonial records.) In 1709, Hicks purchased a land tract of 1280 acres along the northside of the Meherrin River that has been previously surveyed by Arthur Kavanaugh.<ref name=\"nativeamericanroots.wordpress.com\"/>\n\nGreensville County separated from Brunswick county in 1781 and Hicksford became the county seat (court convening monthly at a nearby tavern). In May 1781, British Col. [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s cavalry crossed at Hicksford while raiding Greensville and Southampton counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HMCFV_tarletons-movements_Emporia-VA.html|title=Tarleton's Movements - Emporia - VA - US - Historical Marker Project|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter statehood, the Virginia General Assembly recognized the Town of '''Belfield''' on the river's northern bank in 1798, and Hicksford on the southern bank the next year.<ref>Travis C. McDonald Jr., Emporia: A Centennial Retrospective 1887-1987 (Emporia Centennial Committee 1987)</ref>\n\nIn the following decades, the surrounding area remained rural, and development in Hicksford exceeded that of Belfield. An 1847 account documented 12-20 dwellings in Hicksford worth about $10,025 and Belfield's buildings worth $3050; in 1865 Hicksford's buildings were valued at $20,700 and Belfield's at $3650.  However, by 1885 Hicksford had only grown to $22,915 while Belfield had grown to 7300.<ref>McDonald at p. 8</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the [[Petersburg Railroad]] (to Weldon), built in 1830, was a tactical prize as Union troops sought to isolate the confederate capitol. In 1857, '''Belfield''' was a stop on the [[Petersburg Railroad]].  Two battles for the control of the Weldon Railroad were fought near Petersburg during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] in [[Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road|June 1864]] and [[Battle of Globe Tavern|September 1864]]. On December 7, 1864, 28,000 Union troops led by Major General [[Gouverneur K. Warren]] tried to sever that key supply route further south by uprooting tracks, and managed to stop Confederate troops under Major General [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] from destroying the Meherrin river bridge. However, when they retreated, Confederates rebuilt the railway line.<ref name=\"historical-markers.org\">{{cite web|url=http://photos.historical-markers.org/Virginia/Greensville-County/VA-UM46-Hicksford-Raid|title=VA-UM46 Hicksford Raid|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"historical-markers.org\"/> After the war, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was leased to the [[Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad]], which went bankrupt in 1878.\n\nGreensville County native and delegate [[Benjamin D. Tillar Jr.]] (1855-1887) received a charter for the [[Atlantic and Danville Railway]], which he planned would go from [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] as had the Weldon railroad, but more westward through the Meherrin river towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markerhistory.com/benjamin-d-tillar-jr-marker-um-39|title=Benjamin D. Tillar, Jr. UM-39 - Marker History|date=1 January 1853|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> In 1887, Hicksford and Belfield merged, forming the newly [[incorporated town]] of Emporia.  It was named after the town of [[Emporia, Kansas]], home town of Tillar's friend U.S. Senator [[Preston B. Plumb]] of Kansas. However, the railroad boom proved short-lived, as poor farm conditions and the [[Panic of 1893]] caused the county's population to decrease between 1880 and 1890. The [[Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad]] also ran through Emporia.\n\nEmporia was re-chartered in 1892, and the town issued its first bonds (to establish a water plant, lighting and street improvements) in 1900. It hosted an agricultural fair in 1906, and brick buildings replaced frame structures. Banks were chartered, followed by land improvement companies and insurance companies, then various stores, automobile companies and cola bottlers.<ref>McDonald pp. 8-16</ref>\n\nThe [[Virginia General Assembly]] re-chartered the Town of Emporia as an independent city in 1967, five years after the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] purchased and reorganized the Atlantic and Danville Railway. Now, a major north-south [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railway line crosses a [[Norfolk Southern]] east-west line in Emporia. Also, [[U.S. Route 58 in Virginia|U.S. Route 58]] crosses Emporia east-west and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|U.S. Route 301]] crosses north-south, so providing services for travelers continues to be important in modern Emporia.\n\nHistoric buildings in Emporia include the [[Belfield-Emporia Historic District]], [[Hicksford-Emporia Historic District]], [[Greensville County Courthouse Complex]], [[Greensville County Training School]], [[H. T. Klugel Architectural Sheet Metal Work Building]], [[Old Merchants and Farmers Bank Building]], and [[Village View (Emporia, Virginia)|Village View]], all of which are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEmporia is located at {{coord|36|41|34|N|77|32|17|W|type:city}} (36.693018, -77.53809).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.0|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|6.9|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\" /> The city is located about 65 miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], about 80 miles west of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and about 60 miles north of [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], [[North Carolina]].\n\n==Governance==\nBy circa 2015 the city and Greensville County, in a cost-saving measure, combined their local government operations.<ref name=Gabayp436>{{cite journal|author=Gabay, Barry|url=https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2016/02/Gabay-501.pdf|title=SOCIOECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND THE GREATER RICHMOND SCHOOL DISTRICT: THE FEASIBILITY OF INTERDISTRICT CONSOLIDATION|work=[[University of Richmond Law Review]]|volume=51|date=2015-10-16|pages=397\u2013438}} - page cited: 436.</ref>\nA major source of the revenue for Greensville County now comes from speeding tickets issued to out of state travelers along I-95.
