{"title_page": "Trifles (play)", "text_new": "{{About|the play|the dessert|Trifle}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Trifles''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[Susan Glaspell]].  It was first performed by the [[Provincetown Players]] at the Wharf Theatre in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], on August 8, 1916.  In the original performance, Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. The play is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks. The play was soon followed by the short story, \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]]\", also written by Glaspell, which carries the same characters and plot line. Written at the same time as the first wave of feminism, the play contrasts how women act in public and in private as well as how they perform in front of other women versus how they perform in front of men. \n\n[[File:Susan Glaspell.jpg|thumb|Susan Glaspell graduation portrait, 1894.]]\n\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===Characters===\n\n* '''George Henderson''' \u2013 The county attorney (originally played by [[Michael Hulgan]])\n* '''Henry Peters''' \u2013 Local sheriff and husband of Mrs. Peters (originally played by [[Robert Conville]])\n* '''Lewis Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights (originally played by [[George Cram Cook]])\n* '''Mrs. Peters''' \u2013 Wife of the sheriff (originally played by [[Alice Hall (actor)|Alice Hall]]).

She is never seen in the play, she is isolated in her jail cell throughout the play. Without Minnie being seen by the audience, this gives the audience the ability to not be swayed by what she looks like, her character, or her condition. Audience members can see her quality of life in her home without having to see her, allowing them to deduce their own conclusions<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Summary===\nThe play begins as the men, followed by the women, enter the Wrights\u2019 empty farmhouse. On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband dead upstairs with a rope around his neck. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the county attorney, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Peters are searching the house for evidence, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find clues in the kitchen and hallway to this mystery. The men find no clues upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, but the women find a dead canary that cracks the case wide open. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. The wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. After the women discover the truth, they hide the evidence against Mrs. Wright so that she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n=== Background ===\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a news journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.  Hossack's wife, Margaret, was accused of killing her husband. Margaret was also abused by her husband. However, Margaret argued that an intruder had killed John with an axe.  Allegedly, Mrs. Hossack committed the murder and she was sent to a state penitentiary. She was convicted but it was overturned on appeal.<ref>Belasco & Johnson, The Bedford Anthology of American Literature, Volume II: 1865-Present, Bedford-St.Martin's Press, Boston, 2008, p.782</ref> Due to the in depth information she received from the case Glaspell was able to go into graphic details in Trifles.

Their respective [[social roles]] allow them to perceive very different aspects of Minnie's life. One of the differences in psychology shown in the play is that women need a sense of community and do not fare well with loneliness, while men seem to be able to cope with loneliness.\n\nThere is also a theme of justice within the play, as the wives of the men recognize that Minnie was abused by her husband, and hide the evidence against her so that she will not be found guilty. The women side with Minnie and understand why she chose to kill her husband. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/trifles/themes|title=Trifles Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> Meanwhile, the men in the play do not see the years of abuse she went through and just want to gather the evidence against her and send Minnie to jail got the murder of her husband. \n\nAnother theme of this play is isolation and abuse, John kept Minnie locked in the house without any communication to the outside world as the telephone was disconnected, not leaving her any money, not buying her any new clothes thus limiting her interaction with any other women, maybe in fear of shame, as well as killing her pet canary.  \n\nThe power of silence is a theme within the play as well. The two women, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, find the dead canary and decide to conceal this information from the men. The women are silent in the beginning of the play as the men believe that their comments and findings are \"trifles\", but become powerful in their silence by the ending. Mrs. Hale's and Mrs. Peters' silence in their knowledge of the canary symbolizes their unity as women, as they can relate to the oppression that Minnie Foster was feeling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holstein|first=Suzy|date=2003|title=\u201cSilent Justice in a Different Key: Glaspell\u2019s \u2018Trifles.\u2019\u201d|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.proxygsu-mga1.galileo.usg.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=9&sid=60b78bbc-4aba-4487-8ea0-fec298fa5451%40sdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=<i>The Midwest Quarterly<i>|volume=44|pages=282-290|via=GALILEO}}</ref>  \n\n=== Symbolism ===\n\nAs the women note, Minnie used to sing before she married John Wright. Martha theorizes that after Minnie's marriage, she was prevented, by her husband, from singing or doing anything else which would have yielded her pleasure. Minnie's plight is represented by Martha as a spiritual death, symbolized in the strangling of her songbird companion.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that both Martha and Mrs. Peters express guilt over not having visited Minnie more often\u2014 which opens up the possibility that Martha's reading of the evidence is skewed by her own feelings that she should have helped Minnie.\n\nThe use of Minnie's name is also symbolic. When the women talk about her, they use the name Minnie only when talking about her past. When she was a free-spirited, single woman her name was Minnie. This represents her happiness. The Women refer to her as Mrs. Wright when talking about her more recently. They talk as if Minnie died when she was married and Mrs. Wright took her place. The free-spirit died and was replaced by an isolated wife. The use of her names varies to demonstrate this metaphorical death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=158362&val=5319&title=A%20STUDY%20OF%20SYMBOLS%20IN%20SUSAN%20GLASPELL|title=A STUDY OF SYMBOLS IN SUSAN GLASPELL'S TRIFLES|last1=Mai|first1=Sarah|publisher=Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum Jombang|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as a symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe male characters are clear symbols of \"law\" and cold rationality, while the women display an intuitiveness representative of the [[psychoanalytic]] movement, evoking an interrogation of the value of superficial rational thought.\n\nMrs. Wright also acts as the \"invisible\" heroine for women's rights as the play was written and set during the suffragette movement.\n\nSewing, quilting, and knitting are pastimes of women. This play features a quilt and the women in the story are able to quilt together what happened in the house. The quilt Minnie was making included a [[hearth]] in the middle of it. Typically, a hearth is the symbol of a woman\u2019s dominant place in the house. In regards to Minnie, her hearth is broken and cold stove<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=|title=feminism as theme in twentieth-century american women's drama|last=Friedman|first=Sharon|date=4/19/2020|website=JSTOR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Minnie ended up knotting pieces of the quilt, subsequently, the same knot is used to kill John Wright. However, the women recognize this and the men do not as men do not trivialize with womanly things. The two women are constantly curious about Mrs. Wright's quilt and if she was going to quilt it or knot it. The same line about the quilt is mentioned several times throughout the play because as the script ends it allows the reader to understand what Minnie did. Mr. Wright was strangled and the rope had an \"odd\" know just like the quilt. \n\nMinnie is chastised about not having a pristine and clean kitchen: the kitchen table is only half clean, the sugar bucket cover was not on completely. Minnie was not able to finish baking her bread. While the men look over these details, brushing it off as Minnie being lazy, the women recognize the signs and continue to piece together what truly conspired.\n\nThe canary has a significant role, Before Minnie was married to her husband, the canary was a significant portion of her life, she enjoyed to hear it sing and was even described \u201cas a bird herself\u201d. The canary was ultimately strangled by her husband. The canary symbolizes Minnie, as John strangled the canary after he got frustrated with its singing. Minnie was then silenced with John\u2019s abuse as he silenced the canary<ref name=\":1\" />. The broken birdcage also symbolizes the depressing marriage that John and Minnie are in. They are trapped in a cage of marriage.The killing of Minnie\u2019s pet was her breaking point, a woman scorned took her revenge on her abusive husband. The killing of the canary also symbolizes the loss of Minnie\u2019s voice and her freedom. The women in Minnie\u2019s kitchen are the only ones who understand the significance of the dead canary; they decide not to share it with the men. If they shared their finding of the canary, the men could use it as evidence against Minnie, making her seem more guilty, they blame the cat on eating the canary, since women are after all only obsessed with trifles. Friedman states \"Feminism as a theme\u00a0 should not be understood as simply a call for women's rights on the part of the playwright or her characters. Rather, it may be a statement about feminine consciousness, the feelings and perceptions associated with a female character's identity of a woman.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  Without the women not telling the men about the canary, they are showing the readers that they are more controlling of the situation than then men are. \n\nFurthermore, an additional symbol at is important within the play is the rocking chair. Unquestionably, the quilt, birdcage, and cherry preserves are primary clues regarding how Mr. Wright was killed. However, an additional symbol that was harder to interpret is the rocking chair. At the beginning of the play, Hale states that he opened the door and there sat Mrs. Wright in the rocking chair. The chair can be seen as a form of anxiety for Mrs. Wright. As she sits in the rocking chair she tells Hale that her husband is dead. Also, the rocking chair is described as an old wooden chair within the play. The condition of the chair could depict the downfall of Mrs. Wright\u2019s life over the years. The death of Mr. Wright is a somewhat unknown situation. The rocking chair stands for uneasiness as well. Additionally, the rocking chair serves as a presence for Mrs. Wright since she is never actually present throughout the play. \n\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters. \n\n=== Feminist drama ===\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to the evidence against her. The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts.  Clearly, the wife is represented by the caged bird, a common symbol of women's roles in society. \n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. Their minds are clouded by prejudice and they disregard important clues as being mere \"trifles\" that women concern themselves with. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice. \"Women who kill evoke fear because they challenge societal constructs of femininity - passivity, restraint, and nurture\"<ref name=\":0\" />, states Ben-Zvi. \n\nWomen and men view the nature of Minnie Wright\u2019s crime very differently.  The men in this play are blind to the emotional abuse that Minnie went through from her husband. In 1917, women were not even allowed to vote, serve as legislators, judges, or be on a jury<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angel|first=Marina|date=|title=Teaching Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers and Trifles|url=|journal=Journal of Legal Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. In America, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] states that the accused are allowed to have a jury of their peers, in 1917 America, if a woman committed a crime and had to go to trial; she would not be surrounded with her peers. However in this instance, the women act as Minnie\u2019s unofficial jury in the kitchen. The women find evidence of abuse and realize that is why Minnie killed her husband for. They end up throwing away and hiding evidence, to keep Minnie from being convicted. It is not known if Minnie will go to a real court or not. Readers are able to view this story in multiple different viewpoints and it is beneficial to readers to see that things are multifaceted and how different views of a situation can impact someone\u2019s decision. \n\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development for women differ to those of men, a woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=The Path to Sisterhood|last1=Mael|first1=Phyllis|website=Literature Film Quarterly|accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref> \n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ben-Zvi|first=Linda|title='Murder, She Wrote': The Genesis of Susan Glaspell's 'Trifles'|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1992|volume=44|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|url=http://americanfiction.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2010/06/Trifles-Genesis.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2014|doi=10.2307/3208736|jstor=3208736}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hinz-Bode|first=Kristina|title=Susan Glaspell and the anxiety of expression|date=2006|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=55\u201374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5SzHjfQBbgC&printsec=frontcover&dq|isbn=9780786483709}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ghostranchproductions.com/ \"Trifles\" on DVD]\n*[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/GlaTrif.xml Text of ''Trifles'' from the University of Virginia]\n* {{librivox book | title=Trifles | author=Susan GLASPELL}}\n\n[[Category:1916 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Susan Glaspell]]\n[[Category:One-act plays]]\n[[Category:Plays based on actual events]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the play|the dessert|Trifle}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Trifles''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[Susan Glaspell]].

While the men look over these details, brushing it off as Minnie being lazy, the women recognize the signs and continue to piece together what truly conspired.\n\nThe canary has a significant role, Before Minnie was married to her husband, the canary was a significant portion of her life, she enjoyed to hear it sing and was even described \u201cas a bird herself\u201d. The canary was ultimately strangled by her husband. The canary symbolizes Minnie, as John strangled the canary after he got frustrated with its singing. Minnie was then silenced with John\u2019s abuse as he silenced the canary<ref name=\":1\" />. The broken birdcage also symbolizes the depressing marriage that John and Minnie are in. They are trapped in a cage of marriage.The killing of Minnie\u2019s pet was her breaking point, a woman scorned took her revenge on her abusive husband. The killing of the canary also symbolizes the loss of Minnie\u2019s voice and her freedom. The women in Minnie\u2019s kitchen are the only ones who understand the significance of the dead canary; they decide not to share it with the men. If they shared their finding of the canary, the men could use it as evidence against Minnie, making her seem more guilty, they blame the cat on eating the canary, since women are after all only obsessed with trifles. Friedman states \"Feminism as a theme\u00a0 should not be understood as simply a call for women's rights on the part of the playwright or her characters. Rather, it may be a statement about feminine consciousness, the feelings and perceptions associated with a female character's identity of a woman.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  Without the women not telling the men about the canary, they are showing the readers that they are more controlling of the situation than then men are. \n\nFurthermore, an additional symbol at is important within the play is the rocking chair. Unquestionably, the quilt, birdcage, and cherry preserves are primary clues regarding how Mr. Wright was killed. However, an additional symbol that was harder to interpret is the rocking chair. At the beginning of the play, Hale states that he opened the door and there sat Mrs. Wright in the rocking chair. The chair can be seen as a form of anxiety for Mrs. Wright. As she sits in the rocking chair she tells Hale that her husband is dead. Also, the rocking chair is described as an old wooden chair within the play. The condition of the chair could depict the downfall of Mrs. Wright\u2019s life over the years. The death of Mr. Wright is a somewhat unknown situation. The rocking chair stands for uneasiness as well. Additionally, the rocking chair serves as a presence for Mrs. Wright since she is never actually present throughout the play. \n\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters. \n\n=== Feminist drama ===\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to the evidence against her. The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts.  Clearly, the wife is represented by the caged bird, a common symbol of women's roles in society. \n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. Their minds are clouded by prejudice and they disregard important clues as being mere \"trifles\" that women concern themselves with. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice. \"Women who kill evoke fear because they challenge societal constructs of femininity - passivity, restraint, and nurture\"<ref name=\":0\" />, states Ben-Zvi. \n\nWomen and men view the nature of Minnie Wright\u2019s crime very differently.  The men in this play are blind to the emotional abuse that Minnie went through from her husband. In 1917, women were not even allowed to vote, serve as legislators, judges, or be on a jury<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angel|first=Marina|date=|title=Teaching Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers and Trifles|url=|journal=Journal of Legal Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. In America, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] states that the accused are allowed to have a jury of their peers, in 1917 America, if a woman committed a crime and had to go to trial; she would not be surrounded with her peers. However in this instance, the women act as Minnie\u2019s unofficial jury in the kitchen. The women find evidence of abuse and realize that is why Minnie killed her husband for. They end up throwing away and hiding evidence, to keep Minnie from being convicted. It is not known if Minnie will go to a real court or not. Readers are able to view this story in multiple different viewpoints and it is beneficial to readers to see that things are multifaceted and how different views of a situation can impact someone\u2019s decision. \n\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development for women differ to those of men, a woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site|title=The Path to Sisterhood|last1=Mael|first1=Phyllis|website=Literature Film Quarterly|accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref> \n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ben-Zvi|first=Linda|title='Murder, She Wrote': The Genesis of Susan Glaspell's 'Trifles'|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1992|volume=44|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|url=http://americanfiction.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2010/06/Trifles-Genesis.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2014|doi=10.2307/3208736|jstor=3208736}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hinz-Bode|first=Kristina|title=Susan Glaspell and the anxiety of expression|date=2006|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=55\u201374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5SzHjfQBbgC&printsec=frontcover&dq|isbn=9780786483709}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ghostranchproductions.com/ \"Trifles\" on DVD]\n*[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/GlaTrif.xml Text of ''Trifles'' from the University of Virginia]\n* {{librivox book | title=Trifles | author=Susan GLASPELL}}\n\n[[Category:1916 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Susan Glaspell]]\n[[Category:One-act plays]]\n[[Category:Plays based on actual events]]\n", "name_user": "Haley.carter1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifles_(play)"}

There are many variations of callaloo which may include [[coconut milk]], [[crab]], [[conch]], [[spiny lobster|Caribbean lobster]], [[meat]]s, [[pumpkin]], [[chili pepper]]s,  and other [[seasoning]]s such as chopped onions and garlic. The ingredients are added and simmered down to a somewhat stewlike consistency. When done, callaloo is dark green in colour and is served as a side dish which may be used as a gravy for other food.\n\nCallaloo is widely known throughout the Caribbean and has a distinctively Caribbean origin, utilising indigenous (''Xanthosoma'') plants and modified with African influences, such as okra. (See [[Palaver sauce]] for the West African dish.). Trinidadians have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish, for Trinidadians, Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra.\n\nIn Jamaica, callaloo is often combined with saltfish and is usually seasoned with tomatoes, onion, escallion, scotch bonnet peppers and margarine/cooking oil and steamed. It is often eaten with roasted breadfruit, boiled green bananas and dumplings and it is a popular breakfast dish.\n\nIn Grenada, callaloo is steamed with garlic, onion and coconut milk and often eaten as a side dish. Grenadians also stir or blend the mixture until it has a smooth consistent texture. Callaloo soup comprising callaloo, okra (optional), dumplings, ground provision like yam, potato (sweet and \"Irish\") chicken and beef is traditionally eaten on Saturdays. It is also one of the most important ingredient in Oil Down, the Island's National Dish comprising steamed breadfruit, callaloo, dumplings, ground provision, carrot and several varieties of meat--salt fish, chicken, pork. All of this is steamed in coconut milk and saffron powder. Salt and pepper is added. Due to the high iron content of callaloo, Grenadians douse it down with a fruit drink high in Vitamin C especially as Iron could only be absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C. \n\nIn the Virgin Islands, callaloo is served with a dish of [[fungee]] on the side.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, \"calalou au crabe\" (crab callaloo) is a traditional Easter dish.\n\nA similar variation is the recipe called \"Laing\" which is popular in the Philippines, mainly the Bicol region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Jamaican dishes]]\n* [[List of stews]]\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Davidson, Alan.

Callaloo is the [[National Dish]] of the twin Island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n\n==Plant sources for callaloo leaves==\n[[File:Elephantear reduced.jpg|right|250px|thumb|''[[Xanthosoma]]'']]\n*[[Taro]], also called ''dasheen'' in the West Indies, the leaves of this root crop are used in the Trinidadian version of the dish.\n*Tannia or malanga (''[[Xanthosoma]]'') called ''calalu'' in [[Puerto Rico]]\n*[[Amaranth]] species include ''[[Amaranthus spinosus]]'' used in the West Indies; ''[[Amaranthus flavus]]'' is a yellow variety used in [[Brazil]] and known as ''caruru''; ''[[Amaranthus viridis]]'' in Jamaica ; ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]'' in the Caribbean\n*[[Pokeweed]] species, ''[[Phytolacca octandra]]'' or \"West Indian foxglove\" (no relation to garden foxglove, genus ''[[Digitalis]]'')\n*[[Nightshade]] species, ''[[Solanum americanum]]''\n*[[Water spinach]] (''Ipomoea aquatica''; a form of [[Ipomoea|morning glory]])                                           In India(state ofAndhra and Telangana) people uses leafy vegetable (Thothakura)\n\n==Callaloo recipes==\n[[File:Jamaican breakfast ackee saltfish callaloo.jpg|thumb|A Jamaican breakfast including callaloo (bottom right)]]\nCallaloo in Trinidad & Tobago and other eastern Caribbean countries is generally made with [[okra]] and dasheen or water spinach ''Ipomoea aquatica''.  There are many variations of callaloo which may include [[coconut milk]], [[crab]], [[conch]], [[spiny lobster|Caribbean lobster]], [[meat]]s, [[pumpkin]], [[chili pepper]]s,  and other [[seasoning]]s such as chopped onions and garlic. The ingredients are added and simmered down to a somewhat stewlike consistency. When done, callaloo is dark green in colour and is served as a side dish which may be used as a gravy for other food.\n\nCallaloo is widely known throughout the Caribbean and has a distinctively Caribbean origin, utilising indigenous (''Xanthosoma'') plants and modified with African influences, such as okra. (See [[Palaver sauce]] for the West African dish.). Trinidadians have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish, for Trinidadians, Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra.\n\nIn Jamaica, callaloo is often combined with saltfish and is usually seasoned with tomatoes, onion, escallion, scotch bonnet peppers and margarine/cooking oil and steamed. It is often eaten with roasted breadfruit, boiled green bananas and dumplings and it is a popular breakfast dish.\n\nIn Grenada, callaloo is steamed with garlic, onion and coconut milk and often eaten as a side dish. Grenadians also stir or blend the mixture until it has a smooth consistent texture. Callaloo soup comprising callaloo, okra (optional), dumplings, ground provision like yam, potato (sweet and \"Irish\") chicken and beef is traditionally eaten on Saturdays. It is also one of the most important ingredient in Oil Down, the Island's National Dish comprising steamed breadfruit, callaloo, dumplings, ground provision, carrot and several varieties of meat--salt fish, chicken, pork. All of this is steamed in coconut milk and saffron powder. Salt and pepper is added. Due to the high iron content of callaloo, Grenadians douse it down with a fruit drink high in Vitamin C especially as Iron could only be absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C. \n\nIn the Virgin Islands, callaloo is served with a dish of [[fungee]] on the side.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, \"calalou au crabe\" (crab callaloo) is a traditional Easter dish.\n\nA similar variation is the recipe called \"Laing\" which is popular in the Philippines, mainly the Bicol region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Jamaican dishes]]\n* [[List of stews]]\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Davidson, Alan.

As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land on which present-day Upper Arlington sits was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres, land south of the current Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

An Economic Development Division provides a range of services to help existing, new and expanding businesses grow and be successful in the community while diversifying and expanding the range of businesses, and amenities available to residents and strengthening the tax base. The Engineering Division manages the City's public infrastructure\u2014such as roads, waterlines, sanitary and storm sewer systems, and public right-of-way\u2014with a 10-year Capital Improvement Program in place to ensure proactive reinvestment in these critical community assets. The Public Works Division focuses on vital services that keep motorists traveling safely within our community throughout the seasons, including minor road repairs, street cleaning, snow removal and leaf collection.\n\nThe City is always looking for innovative ways to bring the best care and public safety to the community. This is done through a variety of services including: CARES, Bike Helmets for Kids, Blood Pressure Checks, CPR Training, and Safe Baby Training. Upper Arlington's Fire Division also staffs all medic trucks with at least two paramedics and all fire apparatus with at least one paramedic at all times. The Police Division provides 24-hour service and is an integral part of developing and maintaining a safe and secure community.\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department fulfills the recreational, cultural and educational needs of the community through an exciting array of programs and activities, as well as maintaining the City's beautiful parks, street trees and other public spaces. They offer programs and activities for youth, adult and senior adults varying from cultural arts, aquatics and tennis, culinary and crafts.\n\nUpper Arlington oversees and maintains 21 parks covering approximately 186 acres. Park facilities include playgrounds, sports fields, shelters and picnic areas, walking paths, fitness trails and wooded areas. In addition, the City owns and operates three outdoor community swimming pools \u2013 Tremont Pool, Devon Pool, and the Reed Road Water Park \u2013 which are open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upperarlingtonoh.gov/|title=City of Upper Arlington \u2013 Cherished Past &#9733 Golden Future|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Upper Arlington Public Library ==\nThe Upper Arlington Public Library system comprises the Main Library, a 60,000 square foot facility located on Tremont Road near the geographic center of the city, the 10,000 square foot Lane Road Branch, approximately three miles to the north, and the 4,400 square foot Miller Park Branch, one and one half miles south near the center of Old Arlington. Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualibrary.org/|title=Upper Arlington Public Library|website=Upper Arlington Public Library|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Thanks to his perseverance, the Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, the Upper Arlington Library System is considered a community jewel, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and fellowship.\n\n==Sister city==\nThe city is sister cities with [[St. Andrews]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[John W.

As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land that is currently Upper Arlington was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres, land south of the current Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).
