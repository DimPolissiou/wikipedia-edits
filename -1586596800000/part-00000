Frederik is the elder son of [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] and the late [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henrik, Prince Consort]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:En dronning med farverig stil.jpg|left|thumb|Frederik as an infant in the arms of his mother]] \nFrederik was born at [[Rigshospitalet]] the [[Copenhagen University Hospital]] in [[Copenhagen]], on 26 May 1968, to the then [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]], oldest daughter of [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] and heir presumptive to the Danish throne, and [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Henrik]]. At the time of his birth, his [[Frederick IX of Denmark|maternal grandfather]] was on the throne of Denmark and his [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|matrilineal great-grandfather]] was on the throne of Sweden.\n\nHe was baptized on 24 June 1968, at [[Holmen Church]], in Copenhagen. He was christened Frederik after his maternal grandfather, King Frederick IX, continuing the Danish royal tradition of the heir apparent being named either Frederik or Christian. His middle names honour his paternal grandfather, Andr\u00e9 de Laborde de Monpezat; his father, Prince Henrik; and his maternal great-grandfather, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. Frederik's godparents include Count Etienne de Laborde de Monpezat (paternal uncle); [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]] (maternal aunt); [[Prince George Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Georg of Denmark]]; [[Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Belgium|Grand Duchess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Luxembourg]] (his maternal grandfather's first cousin's daughter; Baron Christian de Watteville-Berckheim and [[Birgitta Hillings\u00f8|Birgitta Juel Hillings\u00f8]].\n\nHe became Crown Prince of Denmark when his mother succeeded to the throne as [[Margrethe II]] on 14 January 1972.\n\n==Education and career==\nFrederik attended primary school at ''Krebs' Skole'' during the years 1974\u20131981, from 1974\u20131976 as a private pupil at [[Amalienborg]] Palace, and from the third form at ''Krebs' Skole''. In the period 1982\u20131983, he was a boarder at ''\u00c9cole des Roches'' in [[Normandy]], France. In 1986, Frederik graduated from the upper secondary school of ''\u00d8regaard [[high school|Gymnasium]]''.\n\nHis mother tongue is Danish. In addition he is fluent in French (his father's language), English, and German.\n\nIn 1986 he began a course in [[Political Science]] at [[Aarhus University]]. This included a year at [[Harvard University]] (1992\u20131993) under the name of Frederik Henriksen, studying political science. He then took up a position for three months with the Danish UN mission in New York in 1994. In 1995, he obtained his MSc degree in [[Political Science]] from [[Aarhus University]]. He completed the course in the prescribed number of years with an exam result above average, thus becoming the first royal to obtain a master's degree.

Frederik is the elder son of [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] and the late [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henrik, Prince Consort]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:En dronning med farverig stil.jpg|left|thumb|Frederik as an infant in the arms of his mother]] \nFrederik was born at [[Rigshospitalet]] the [[Copenhagen University Hospital]] in [[Copenhagen]], on 26 May 1968, to the then [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]], oldest daughter of [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] and heir presumptive to the Danish throne, and [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Henrik]]. At the time of his birth, his [[Frederick IX of Denmark|maternal grandfather]] was on the throne of Denmark and his [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|matrilineal great-grandfather]] was on the throne of Sweden.\n\nHe was baptized on 24 June 1968, at [[Holmen Church]], in Copenhagen. He was christened Frederik after his maternal grandfather, King Frederick IX, continuing the Danish royal tradition of the heir apparent being named either Frederik or Christian. His middle names honour his paternal grandfather, Andr\u00e9 de Laborde de Monpezat; his father, Prince Henrik; and his maternal great-grandfather, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. Frederik's godparents include Count Etienne de Laborde de Monpezat (paternal uncle); [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]] (maternal aunt); [[Prince George Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Georg of Denmark]]; [[Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Belgium|Grand Duchess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Luxembourg]] (his maternal grandfather's first cousin's daughter; Baron Christian de Watteville-Berckheim and [[Birgitta Hillings\u00f8|Birgitta Juel Hillings\u00f8]].\n\nHe became Crown Prince of Denmark when his mother succeeded to the throne as [[Margrethe II]] on 14 January 1972.\n\n==Education and career==\nFrederik attended primary school at ''Krebs' Skole'' during the years 1974\u20131981, from 1974\u20131976 as a private pupil at [[Amalienborg]] Palace, and from the third form at ''Krebs' Skole''. In the period 1982\u20131983, he was a boarder at ''\u00c9cole des Roches'' in [[Normandy]], France. In 1986, Frederik graduated from the upper secondary school of ''\u00d8regaard [[high school|Gymnasium]]''.\n\nHis mother tongue is Danish. In addition he is fluent in French (his father's language), English, and German.\n\nIn 1986 he began a course in [[Political Science]] at [[Aarhus University]]. This included a year at [[Harvard University]] (1992\u20131993) under the name of Frederik Henriksen, studying political science. He then took up a position for three months with the Danish UN mission in New York in 1994. In 1995, he obtained his MSc degree in [[Political Science]] from [[Aarhus University]]. He completed the course in the prescribed number of years with an exam result above average, thus becoming the first royal to obtain a master's degree.

He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J. C.|title= Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind: Ethnography of the African races.|date=1837|publisher= Sherwood, Gilbert & Piper|pages=160|language=english}}</ref>. The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued a to have a lucrative trading agreement with Arabs and Indian traders, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the \"new city\" of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but various sources give some details. According to [[Justin (historian) |Justin]] (2nd century AD), Princess Elissa was the daughter of King [[Belus (Tyre) | Belus II]] of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her brother, Pygmalion, and her. She married her uncle [[Acerbas]], also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between the religious \u00e9lite and the monarchy. Pygmalion was a tyrant, a lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acerbas.<ref name=\"Aubet2001215\">{{cite book|author= Maria Eugenia Aubet|title= The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B7SLWT2vpNcC&pg=PA215|date= 6 September 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-79543-2|page=215}}</ref> Pygmalion assassinated Acerbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.\n\nVirgil's Roman epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', first introduces Queen Dido (the Greek name for Elissa) as a highly esteemed character. In just seven years since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have built a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Virgil portrays her character as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who had recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger-god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology) |Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to [[Founding of Rome | found Rome]]. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas farewells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lies dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\",<ref>4.625, trans. Fitzgerald.</ref> she says (an invocation of [[Hannibal]]). Aeneas goes on to found the predecessor-state of the [[Roman Kingdom]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city Dido had founded, an attitude exemplified by [[Cato the Elder]]'s much-repeated utterance, \"''[[Carthago delenda est]]''\", \"Carthage must be destroyed\".<ref>Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16</ref>\n\n===Phoenician settlement===\nThe Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hodos|first= Tamar|title= Colonial Engagements in the Global Mediterranean Iron Age|journal= Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date= June 2009|volume= 19|issue= 2|pages= 221\u2013241|doi= 10.1017/S0959774309000286|hdl= 1983/49da5a29-8176-4afb-a4c9-bc4a118e216f}}</ref> to provide safe harbors for their merchant fleets,<ref name=\"Martin2007\">{{cite book|author= Susan Rebecca Martin|title= 'Hellenization' and Southern Phoenicia: Reconsidering the Impact of Greece Before Alexander|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m2k_8JtTgsAC|accessdate= 22 February 2013|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-549-52890-6|page=115}}</ref> to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resources, and to conduct trade free of outside interference.<ref name=\"Graham2001\">{{cite book|author= A.

An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army.

In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).<ref name=\"Lange2004\">{{cite book|author=Dierk Lange|title=Ancient Kingdoms of West Africa: Africa-centred and Canaanite-Israelite Perspectives : a Collection of Published and Unpublished Studies in English and French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=J.H.R\u00f6ll Verlag|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3|page=278}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus wrote an account about 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.<ref name=\"Mokhtar1981\">{{cite book|author=G.

In just seven years since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have built a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Virgil portrays her character as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who had recently escaped from [[Troy]].

However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]</ref><ref name=\"Tucker2009\">{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its [[sphere of influence]], bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\n===Punic Wars===\n{{further|Punic Wars|First Punic War|Mercenary War|Second Punic War|Third Punic War}}\n{{Punic Wars}}\n[[File:CarthageElectrumCoin250BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Carthage [[electrum]] coin, c. 250 BC.

In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).<ref name=\"Lange2004\">{{cite book|author=Dierk Lange|title=Ancient Kingdoms of West Africa: Africa-centred and Canaanite-Israelite Perspectives : a Collection of Published and Unpublished Studies in English and French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=J.H.R\u00f6ll Verlag|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3|page=278}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus wrote an account about 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.<ref name=\"Mokhtar1981\">{{cite book|author=G.

A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.\n\nSurviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices.

There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.\n\nAccounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in the\ntophet.<ref name=\"Miles2011\">{{cite book|author=Richard Miles|title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOQ9JLtGj0UC|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-51703-1|page=1797}}</ref> The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own.

[[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[silent film]] ''[[Cabiria]]'' is narrowly based on Flaubert's novel.\n\n''The Young Carthaginian'' (1887) by [[G. A.

In these books, Carthage is dominated by Germanic tribes, and the premise is that the [[Visigoths]] conquered Carthage and set up a huge empire that repelled the Muslim conquest.
