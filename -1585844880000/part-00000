It is the first album without original vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]], who was dismissed in 2005, as well as the first album involving future member [[Troy Donockley]] on [[uilleann pipes]] and [[tin whistle]]. It is the first of only two albums with vocalist [[Anette Olzon]], who was eventually dismissed in 2012 after the release of the band's subsequent album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anette-olzon-i-didnt-leave-nightwish-i-was-fired/ Lead songwriter</ref> [[Tuomas Holopainen]] has referred to it as the \"album that saved his life\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/group/Tuomas+Holopainen/forum/29012/_/321352|title=TUOMAS HOLOPAINEN \u2013 \"Dark Passion Play Is The Album That Saved My Life\"  \u2013 Tuomas Holopainen Discussions \u2013 Last.fm}}</ref>\n\nThe first single, \"[[Eva (Nightwish song)|Eva]]\", was leaked on the Internet six days before its official release, prompting the band to release the single earlier to boost downloads. Several other versions of the song were posted on YouTube and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] sites a month later; the entire album with record label [[voice-over]]s had been leaked on the Internet by 2 August. The full album (without voiceovers) was leaked on 21 September 2007, as a result of several stores in [[Mexico]] selling the retail album much prior to the worldwide release date.\n\nPre-orders for ''Dark Passion Play'' had it certified gold in Finland before it had even been released.<ref name=\"kerrang_2008\"/> The album debuted at number one in 6 European countries, selling over 100,000 copies in [[Finland]] ([[List of music recording certifications#Albums|triple platinum]]).

We don't know the exact sum down to the euros and cents as yet.\"<ref name=\"studio\" /> Half of this cost was incurred in London, over an expensive eight days at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, UK, during which time the [[London Session Orchestra]], the [[Metro Voices|Metro Voices Choir]], a gospel choir and two Irish musicians recorded their parts at the studio.<ref name=\"studio\" /> In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on 16 August 2008 [[Tuomas Holopainen]] recalled:{{quote|After the split with Tarja, we started writing without a singer, and it was quite a liberating feeling. We knew the right girl was out there somewhere, so we could just concentrate on the music.

We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the back of our minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going,\" Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.<ref name=\"kerrang_2008\"/> According to [[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]], the album's studio bill was around 680,000 USD.<ref name=\"usd dB\">{{cite web |last1=Chase |first1=Jesse |title=Katatonia \u2013 \"Brave Murder Day\" |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2007/11/18/katatonia-brave-murder-day/ |website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n\nThe orchestral line-up featured 66 members from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 32 singers from The Metro Voices and twelve gospel singers.<ref name=\"studio\" /> The final mixing process spent more than 75 days at the Finnvox Studios in [[Kitee]], Finland, the same place where Nightwish recorded all their previous albums.<ref name=\"studio\" />\n\n==Music description==\nBefore the album's release, band leader [[Tuomas Holopainen]] said in an interview that the album would have a lot in common with the previous album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]''. For example, the band have kept the new kind of heavier songs, such as \"Master Passion Greed\", \"Whoever Brings the Night\", \"7 Days to the Wolves\", and \"[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]\", but additionally there are softer ballads, such as \"Meadows of Heaven\", \"[[Eva (Nightwish song)|Eva]]\", and \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\". This album includes lots of guest musicians and orchestral parts, just like ''Once'', but with a bigger level.\n\nJust like the album ''Once'', Nightwish included many new influences and experimentations in several tracks. On ''Once'', much inspiration came from Native American music, especially \"Creek Mary's Blood\", which featured Lakota Indian musician John Two-Hawks. However, on ''Dark Passion Play'', much inspiration comes from Finnish and Irish culture and music, which can be clearly heard on \"Last of the Wilds\". Songs like \"Master Passion Greed\" and \"Cadence of Her Last Breath\" included [[thrash metal]] and [[alternative metal]] elements as well, displaying the newer, more modern sound of the band. In a later interview, Hietela said the band \"didn't get as far with it [the song] as we wanted to when we recorded the song in the studio \u2013 we wanted it to be a little bit more impressive\".<ref name=\"teamrock\">{{cite web|title=The 10 Best Nightwish Songs|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-06-13/the-10-best-nightwish-songs-marco-hietala-once-dark-passion-play-imaginaerum-endless-forms-most-beautiful|website=TeamRock|publisher=TeamRock|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nHolopainen also said that there are darker pieces reminiscent of the album ''[[Century Child]]'', such as \"The Poet and the Pendulum\", and some others. It will be a dark album, both musically and lyrically. Even though the album is much more upbeat than ''Century Child''. Songs that reflect this mood are for example the second single \"[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]\" and \"Bye Bye Beautiful\"'s B-side \"Escapist.\"\n\n{{cquote|The extremes are there more than ever before. So it's not going to be like ''Century Child'' 2.

October 2007 in the [[The United States of America|United States]]. It is the first album without original vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]], who was dismissed in 2005, as well as the first album involving future member [[Troy Donockley]] on [[uilleann pipes]] and [[tin whistle]]. It is the first of only two albums with vocalist [[Anette Olzon]], who was eventually dismissed in 2012 after the release of the band's subsequent album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anette-olzon-i-didnt-leave-nightwish-i-was-fired/ Lead songwriter</ref> [[Tuomas Holopainen]] has referred to it as the \"album that saved his life\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/group/Tuomas+Holopainen/forum/29012/_/321352|title=TUOMAS HOLOPAINEN \u2013 \"Dark Passion Play Is The Album That Saved My Life\"  \u2013 Tuomas Holopainen Discussions \u2013 Last.fm}}</ref>\n\nThe first single, \"[[Eva (Nightwish song)|Eva]]\", was leaked on the Internet six days before its official release, prompting the band to release the single earlier to boost downloads. Several other versions of the song were posted on YouTube and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] sites a month later; the entire album with record label [[voice-over]]s had been leaked on the Internet by 2 August. The full album (without voiceovers) was leaked on 21 September 2007, as a result of several stores in [[Mexico]] selling the retail album much prior to the worldwide release date.\n\nPre-orders for ''Dark Passion Play'' had it certified gold in Finland before it had even been released.<ref name=\"kerrang_2008\"/> The album debuted at number one in 6 European countries, selling over 100,000 copies in [[Finland]] ([[List of music recording certifications#Albums|triple platinum]]).

We don't know the exact sum down to the euros and cents as yet.\"<ref name=\"studio\" /> Half of this cost was incurred in London, over an expensive eight days at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, UK, during which time the [[London Session Orchestra]], the [[Metro Voices|Metro Voices Choir]], a gospel choir and two Irish musicians recorded their parts at the studio.<ref name=\"studio\" /> In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on 16 August 2008 [[Tuomas Holopainen]] recalled:{{quote|After the split with Tarja, we started writing without a singer, and it was quite a liberating feeling. We knew the right girl was out there somewhere, so we could just concentrate on the music.

We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the back of our minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going,\" Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.<ref name=\"kerrang_2008\"/> According to [[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]], the album's studio bill was around 680,000 USD.<ref name=\"usd dB\">{{cite web |last1=Chase |first1=Jesse |title=Katatonia \u2013 \"Brave Murder Day\" |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2007/11/18/katatonia-brave-murder-day/ |website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n\nThe orchestral line-up featured 66 members from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 32 singers from The Metro Voices and twelve gospel singers.<ref name=\"studio\" /> The final mixing process spent more than 75 days at the Finnvox Studios in [[Kitee]], Finland, the same place where Nightwish recorded all their previous albums.<ref name=\"studio\" />\n\n==Music description==\nBefore the album's release, band leader [[Tuomas Holopainen]] said in an interview that the album would have a lot in common with the previous album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]''. For example, the band have kept the new kind of heavier songs, such as \"Master Passion Greed\", \"Whoever Brings the Night\", \"7 Days to the Wolves\", and \"[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]\", but additionally there are softer ballads, such as \"Meadows of Heaven\", \"[[Eva (Nightwish song)|Eva]]\", and \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\". This album includes lots of guest musicians and orchestral parts, just like ''Once'', but with a bigger level.\n\nJust like the album ''Once'', Nightwish included many new influences and experimentations in several tracks. On ''Once'', much inspiration came from Native American music, especially \"Creek Mary's Blood\", which featured Lakota Indian musician John Two-Hawks. However, on ''Dark Passion Play'', much inspiration comes from Finnish and Irish culture and music, which can be clearly heard on \"Last of the Wilds\". Songs like \"Master Passion Greed\" and \"Cadence of Her Last Breath\" included [[thrash metal]] and [[alternative metal]] elements as well, displaying the newer, more modern sound of the band. In a later interview, Hietela said the band \"didn't get as far with it [the song] as we wanted to when we recorded the song in the studio \u2013 we wanted it to be a little bit more impressive\".<ref name=\"teamrock\">{{cite web|title=The 10 Best Nightwish Songs|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-06-13/the-10-best-nightwish-songs-marco-hietala-once-dark-passion-play-imaginaerum-endless-forms-most-beautiful|website=TeamRock|publisher=TeamRock|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nHolopainen also said that there are darker pieces reminiscent of the album ''[[Century Child]]'', such as \"The Poet and the Pendulum\", and some others. It will be a dark album, both musically and lyrically. Even though the album is much more upbeat than ''Century Child''. Songs that reflect this mood are for example the second single \"[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]\" and \"Bye Bye Beautiful\"'s B-side \"Escapist.\"\n\n{{cquote|The extremes are there more than ever before.

It was [[Unification of Karnataka|formed]] on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the [[Mysore State|State of Mysore]], it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. The state corresponds to the [[Carnatic region]]. The summer capital is [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] and the winter capital is [[Belgaum|Belagavi]]. The largest city is [[Bangalore]].\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]]. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by population|eighth largest state by population]], comprising 30 [[Districts of India|districts]]. [[Kannada]], one of the [[classical language]]s of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other languages spoken include [[Urdu]], [[Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Kodava language|Kodava]] and [[Beary]].

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Other prominent rivers such as the [[Sharavati]] in [[Shimoga]] and [[Netravati River|Netravati]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea.\n\nThough [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''n\u0101du'', meaning \"elevated land\". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning \"black\" and ''nadu'', meaning \"region\", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the [[Coromandel Coast]] as well.</ref>\n\nWith an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful [[Political history of medieval Karnataka|empires of ancient and medieval India]].

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck.

It was [[Unification of Karnataka|formed]] on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the [[Mysore State|State of Mysore]], it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. The state corresponds to the [[Carnatic region]]. The summer capital is [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] and the winter capital is [[Belgaum|Belagavi]]. The largest city is [[Bangalore]].\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]]. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by population|eighth largest state by population]], comprising 30 [[Districts of India|districts]]. [[Kannada]], one of the [[classical language]]s of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other languages spoken include [[Urdu]], [[Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Kodava language|Kodava]] and [[Beary]].

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Other prominent rivers such as the [[Sharavati]] in [[Shimoga]] and [[Netravati River|Netravati]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea.\n\nThough [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''n\u0101du'', meaning \"elevated land\". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning \"black\" and ''nadu'', meaning \"region\", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the [[Coromandel Coast]] as well.</ref>\n\nWith an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful [[Political history of medieval Karnataka|empires of ancient and medieval India]]. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day.

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name=\"basava\">Kamath (2001), pp. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name=\"bam\">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name=\"chris\">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>\n\n[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga|Kalaburagi]] and [[Banavasi]]. A chance discovery of edicts and several [[Maurya]]n relics at [[Sannati]] in [[Gulbarga district|Kalaburagi district]] in 1986 has proven that the [[Krishna River]] basin was once home to both [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

{"title_page": "Society of American Archivists", "text_new": "The '''Society of American Archivists''' is the oldest and largest [[archivist]] [[Voluntary association|association]] in [[North America]], serving the [[education]]al and [[information]]al needs of more than 5,000 individual archivist and institutional members. Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.archivists.org/about/ | title=SAA: About SAA}}</ref>\n\nThe Society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as [[Encoded Archival Description]], the [[digitizing]] of archival materials, and [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]] and [[art conservation|conservation]] of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Society of American Archivist was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the [[American Historical Association]]. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The [[American Library Association]] created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=J. Frank|date=1983|title=The Blessings of Providence on an Association of Archivists|journal=The American Archivist|volume=46|issue=4|pages=374\u2013399|jstor=40292896|doi=10.17723/aarc.46.4.w7631q465t71h282}}</ref> There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by [[Margaret Cross Norton]] and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland-Swetland|first=Luke|date=1991|title=The Provenance of a Profession: The Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival History|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=54|issue=2|pages=160\u2013175|doi=10.17723/aarc.54.2.w42580v137053675}}</ref> Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first issue of the Society's journal, the [[American Archivist|''American Archivist'',]] appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents.<ref name=\"&quot;Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt to R.D.W. Connor&quot;\">{{cite journal|date=1942|title=News Notes|journal=American Archivist|publisher=Society of American Archivists|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the [[International Council on Archives]] and an archives for the United Nations.<ref name=\":0\" /> A number of committees focused on various interests of the Society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the Society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with [[National Association of State Libraries]] over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.\n\nBy the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists.<ref name=\":1\" /> These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Archives Power: Memory, Accountability, and Social Justice|last=Jimerson|first=Randall|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2009|isbn=978-1-931666-30-5|location=Chicago|pages=76\u2013129}}</ref> There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social historians like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Sam Bass Warner]] brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, a large portion of the Society's focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why.<ref name=\":2\" /> The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella.<ref name=\":2\" /> New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition]]<nowiki/>and a standard for encoding archival [[finding aid]]s, allowing them to be made accessible online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/das|title=Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Curriculum and Certificate Program {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018-2020, which outlined 4 major goal areas for the future. The 4 goal areas are advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members' needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/strategic-plan|title=SAA Strategic Plan {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable ==\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn the 1970s, the SAA began to collaborate with the American Association of Museums and the Association for State and Local History to form a Joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities in Museums, Archives, and Historical Agencies.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hankins|first=Rebecca|date=August 3, 2016|title=Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable (AACR) History|url=|journal=Archivists and Archives of Color Newsletter|volume=|pages=|via=Society of American Archivists}}</ref> Phil Mason and Elsie Freivogel were appointed but outreach to minority members of the SAA was poor. Many minorities were unaware of the Joint Committee and expressed that there had not been any direct communications from the committee's representatives.\n\nThe final report of the SAA Task Force on Diversity states:<blockquote>In 1972 SAA adopted the report of its Committee for the 1970s. Included among the Committee recommendations was a positive injunction to the nominating committee to make the Council more representative of and responsible to the diverse interests of the SAA by considering \"archival interest, age, sex, geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race in the selection of a slate of candidates.\"<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Adkins|first=Elizabeth W.|date=Spring-Summer 2008|title=Our Journey toward Diversity\u2014and a Call to (More) Action|journal=The American Archivist|volume=71|issue=1|pages=21\u201349|jstor=40294493}}</ref></blockquote>Also in the report, \"no person should be nominated as a candidate for an SAA office who, in her or his job, flagrantly espouses or practices discrimination in regard to race, sex, nationality, or political or religious ideology.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1978, the SAA established a joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities. However, the group languished in part from a lack of funds.\n\n=== 1980s: Task Force ===\nThe Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable began as a Task Force on Minorities within the SAA.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 1981, archivists Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Paula Williams drafted a resolution for the task force and members of the SAA approved the group.  Thomas Battle, who also chaired the SAA's Diversity Committee, was appointed the chairman of the Task Force and John Fleckner, Archie Motley, Daniel T. Williams, and Paula Williams were appointed members.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was chosen as the SAA representative for the Joint Committee on Minority Recruitment, replacing Phil Mason.\n\nIn the beginning, members noticed that the task force didn't have much representation. In an interview with AACR History, Karen Jefferson stated:<blockquote>\u201cAt the beginning of the minorities task force Native Americans, people of Latin American and Caribbean descent; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender were included under the umbrella of minorities. Although minorities share some broad experiences as minorities, each group has unique concerns specific to their culture and experience.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>It wasn't until 1982 that a representative of Hispanic archivists was appointed: Idilio Garicia Pena. In its six years of existence, the task force made several recommendations to the SAA Council. These recommendations eventually became the foundation of the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable, and they still pusue them today. Some of their recommendations were to:<blockquote>\u25cf  Develop a roster of minorities working in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a membership committee to help in recruitment efforts for the Society.\n\n\u25cf  Develop a policy statement regarding recruitment of minorities.\n\n\u25cf  Develop an organizational handbook to increase membership\u2019s knowledge of the Society\u2019s structure and functions.\n\n\u25cf  Provide orientation for new members at the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Lower introductory dues rates for new members.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a single-day registration fee for the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Seek funds to develop programs to address needs of minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Financially support SAA\u2019s own activities that are designed to address issues related to minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a scholarship or fellowship to support the development of minorities in the profession.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=2016-08-25|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>Many of these goals were met and the creation of the task force proved immediately to be a vehicle for broader minority participation in the SAA, especially in leadership.\n\n=== 1980s: Roundtable ===\nIn 1987, the task force dissembled, restricted in their effectiveness because of a lack of interest and support from the SAA. The task force made the recommendation that a roundtable be created for minorities, which was formed the same year. Nine SAA members helped to found the roundtable: Diana Lachatanere, Wilda Logan, Carol Rudisell, Karen Jefferson, Ervin Jordan, Clifford Muse, Thomas Battle, Jo Ellen El-Bashir, and Brenda Banks.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Carol Rudisell served as the coordinators. In September 1987, the AACR held their first meeting in New York City at the annual SAA conference. At this meeting, the structure of the roundtable was adopted with two co-chairs, one elected annually with elections every year.<ref name=\":02\" /> Their first year, Carol Rudisell and Donna Wells co-chaired while Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was elected as chair of the Manuscript Section, declining to serve as co-chair.\n\nIt was not required to be a member of the SAA in order to participate in the roundtable. This allowed for a freer space in which the roundtable could interact with more minorities among the archival profession. But SAA membership would be encouraged and the chairpersons were required to be SAA members in good standing.\n\nThere was a lengthy debate on the name of the roundtable, varying from Minorities Roundtable to African American and Third World Archivists Roundtable. In 1994, the name was chosen to be the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Newsletter & Directory ====\nIn 1987, the roundtable began publishing a newsletter through the SAA, although not without objections from society members on costs. Thomas Battle then proposed that [[Howard University]] would completely fund the newsletter and even publish and distribute it for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/wilda-d-logan/|title=Wilda D. Logan|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> These newsletters were available to anyone who was interested in African American archives, manuscripts and collections. In less than a year, Battle returned to the SAA with a high percentage of popularity and interest in the newsletter among not just African Americans but all archivists. This newsletter continued to be funded by Howard University and was later used as a model for other roundtables of the SAA.\n\nLachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Rudisell were the first editors and after the first year, Karen Jefferson and Ruth Hill edited the newsletter. Other editors over the years include Kathryn Neal, Cathy Lynn Mundale, and Jo Ellen El-Bashir, who served one of the longest tenures as editor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2003, under editor Rose Roberta, the newsletter became available electronically and continues to be published online. Today, the newsletter continues to be the main source of communication for the roundtable members. The newsletter provides information on different members, institutions, the SAA, archives, and the activities and achievements of the roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn 1991, Carol Rudisell compiled the first membership directory with racial/ethnic heritage listed for the members. In 1996, this was compiled by Karen Jefferson in the ''Archivists of Color Directory''.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is not a directory on the entire membership of the roundtable but a directory of the archivists of color involved in the AACR. Each archivist has a brief biography, including their education, experience and the institutions they are affiliated with. In 2012, a directory was listed on the AACR website including only the name, job title and contact information of the archivist.\n\n==== Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award ====\nSeveral members of the roundtable, including [[Wilda Logan]], helped to establish the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award in 1993. This award is given to recognize graduate students of color who are actively working toward becoming professional archivists in the SAA.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/archivesandpublichistory/2010/01/15/harold-t-pinkett-minority-student-award/|title=Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award|last=Beaujon|first=Danielle J|date=January 15, 2010|website=Society of American Archivists|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> The award is sponsored by the AACR and funded through the SAA, named after [[Harold T. Pinkett]] who was the first African American archivist to serve at the National Archives.<ref name=\":22\" /> The SAA Council acknowledged the contributions of Harold T. Pinkett in this resolution:<blockquote>Whereas, Harold T. Pinkett served with distinction during his long tenure at the National Archives and Records Service; and Whereas Harold T. Pinkett has been a scholar, archival educator, and mentor who has made important contributions to the archives profession; Therefore be it resolved that in recognition of his lifetime achievements and contributions to the archival profession, the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable supports the renaming of the SAA Minority Student Award to the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award.</blockquote>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness (TFOE) was appointed in 1995-1996. One of the main issues of the task force was to address diversity in the SAA as well as in the archival profession.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this came the creation of the Task Force on Diversity, chaired by Brenda Banks with members Anne Difffendal, John Fleckner, Susan Fox, [[Karen Jefferson]], Deborah King (Burns), Joan Krizak, and [[Kathleen D. Roe|Kathleen Roe]]. The task force investigated the SAA to see where they supported or weakened diversity, discussing possible solutions to improve or encourage it in the SAA as well as the archival profession. Their final report recommended that the SAA:<blockquote>\n* Develop an organizational position statement that articulates SAA\u2019s commitment to becoming a more diverse organization\n* Incorporate diversity into SAA\u2019s strategic planning process.\n* Reinforce and expand existing activities within SAA that support diversity.\n* Identify and establish new initiatives that may assist SAA in its efforts to become a more diverse organization.<ref name=\":02\" />   \n</blockquote>After the Council accepted the report, they approved a statement on diversity that was released on June 13, 1999:<blockquote>The Society of American Archivists is committed to integrating diversity concerns and perspectives into all aspects of the activities and into the fabric of the profession as a whole.  SAA is also committed to the goal of a Society membership that reflects the broad diversity of American society.  SAA believes that these commitments are essential to the effective pursuit of the archival mission \u201cto ensure the identification, preservation, and use the nation\u2019s historical record.<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>Five years later, the SAA Council established a Committee on Diversity in response to complaints that they were moving slowly in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Diversity. After much debate, they established a Task Force on Diversity with its first goal to define 'diversity.'<ref name=\":32\" /> They were also asked to investigate \"how and to what extent issues of democracy are being addressed by the Society.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> The Task Force on Diversity submitted its last report in February 1999. In 1996, one of the few articles written on diversity in the archives profession was published. Kathryn M. Neal details the importance of diversity in archives:<blockquote>Expanding the numbers of staff members of color and tapping their potential should (and no doubt would) enhance the overall functions of archives and manuscript repositories. New ideas would likely be stimulated in areas that include, but certainly are not limited to, donor relations (for instance, how to approach and document members of growing communities of color most effectively) and reference/access (determining how to improve services as user groups become increasingly diverse, or how to attract a more diverse pool of researchers if society's changing demographics are not reflected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neal|first=Kathryn M.|date=1996|title=The Importance of Being Diverse: The Archival Profession and Minority Recruitment|url=|journal=Archival Issues|volume=|pages=145\u2013158|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Today ===\nMany of the original goals of the roundtable exist today. On their website, they have stated their purposes as to \"identify and address the concerns of archivists of African, Asian, Latino and Native American descent; promote wider participation of said archivists in the archival profession; and promote the preservation of archival materials that pertain to people of color.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, the roundtable still recognizes the need for more to be done for minorities, especially in archives. In a report made after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the AACR stated: \"As archivists, we cannot accept invisibility. As a profession, we cannot continue to accept historical erasure and whitewashing through binary historical practices.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuesandadvocacy.wordpress.com/tag/archivists-and-archives-of-color-roundtable/|title=LEADERS OF AACR, LACCHA, LAGAR ON ORLANDO & ARCHIVISTS' ROLE IN CREATING A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of American Archivists: Issues and Advocacy|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the SAA Council created a subcommittee to see the status of the SAA's diversity efforts. In May 2003, they reported that some of the recommendations by the Task Force on Diversity had been addressed while others had not, and the actions had not been effectively reported back to SAA members.<ref name=\":32\" /> The Council then voted for a Committee on Diversity. In August 2003, the Council approved the committee:<blockquote>The SAA Committee on Diversity works to ensure that the organization's services, activities, policies, communications, and products support the goal of a more diverse SAA and professional archival community. It functions as a catalyst for new diversity-related initiatives, developed in coordination with various SAA entities, and as the organization's \"conscience\" in monitoring, evaluating, advocating, and reporting on matters pertaining to the diversity of archival practitioners and documentation.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>In 2007, Elizabeth W. Adkins gave her presidential address at the SAA Annual Meeting in Chicago and highlighted the importance of diversity. \"SAA has been working to address diversity concerns for more than thirty-five years, sometimes effectively and sometimes not so effectively.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In her speech, she focused on SAA's definition of diversity in comparison to others and how they have progressed.\n\nAdkins states that in 1982, only 2.8% of archivists were nonwhite but in 2004, that number jumped to 7%.<ref name=\":32\" /> SAA is only slightly better with about 10% of its members identifying as part of a minority or ethnic group. Adkins compares this with the national population, which is about 25% of nonwhite people, claiming \"both SAA and the profession have a very long way to go to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> But it's a start.\n\nSince 2002, Council meetings and discussion have consistently focused on diversity. Some of the approved motions on diversity from these meetings are:<blockquote>\u2022 Diversity has been and will be incorporated into every Council agenda for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 The Council, SAA staff, and all SAA units must report on diversity initiatives.\n\n\u2022 The president-elect and the Appointments Committee are required to report on the demographics of all committee appointments and on what was done to seek diversity in committee appointments.\n\n\u2022 The Program Committee and Host Committee must report on efforts to address diversity issues in the planning and scheduling of annual meeting programming.\n\n\u2022 The Diversity Committee has been asked to provide a report on the state of diversity at the annual business meeting each year.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Women Archivists Section (WArS) ==\nThe Women Archivists Roundtable (WAR) monitors the status of women archivists and promotes the participation of women in the archives profession, specifically in areas of the Society of American Archivists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/women-archivists-section|title=Women Archivists Section {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nAlthough many women archivists helped shaped the SAA, the status of women in the archival profession didn't receive much attention until the 1970s.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://womenarchivistsroundtable.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2013-10-03|website=Women Archivists Section|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1972, the SAA established the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. The Committee sought to address under representation and identify the barriers and obstacles for advancement.<ref name=\":03\" /> The overall membership population of women had grown since the SAA's inception, but few had risen to the positions of president, officer, or council member.\n\nThe Committee conducted two surveys, one of archivists and one of directors. Through these surveys, the Committee discovered that although many women had comparable education and experience, few of them had risen to administrative positions.<ref>Deutrich, Mabel E. \u201cWomen in Archives: A Summary Report of the Committee of the Status of Women in the Archival Profession.\u201d ''The American Archivist 38'' (1975): 43-46.</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the Committee was created, the Women's Caucus was founded and began publishing ''The SAA Women's Caucus Newsletter''.<ref>Pacifico, Michele F. \u201cFounding Mothers: Women in the Society of American Archivist, 1936-1972.\u201d ''The American Archivist 50'' (1987): 389.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Committee evolved into the Women's Professional Archival Issues Roundtable.

And finally, \"98.7% of respondents felt that unearthing women's history continues to be important, yet only 77.1% make a concerted effort to do so and only 61.9% of respondents actually work with materials related specifically to women.\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nMore recent surveys have indicated the rise of women in archival professions, or even a \"feminization\" of the profession.<ref>Yakel, Elizabeth. \u201cThe Future of the Past: A Survey of Graduates of Master\u2019s-Level Archival Education Programs in the United States.\u201d ''The American Archivist 63'' (2000): 302, 309-310.</ref> Yet Wikipedia does not show this. In 2016, research discovered that only 50 articles exist on Wikipedia for female archivists, compared to 260 for male archivists.<ref name=\":33\" /> And for specifically American archivists, only 15 existed for women compared to 93 for men.<ref name=\":33\" /> So in 2016, WArS hosted a [[wikipedia:Meetup Women Archivists Roundtable Edit-a-thon|Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon]] in Atlanta, and remotely, to encourage more women editors and more articles on women archivists.\n\nIn a survey conducted in 2017, researchers found that of the 2,170 respondents, 1,717 were members of the SAA, which was at a membership of over 6,000 in 2017.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Israel|first=Robin H. and Jodi Reeves Eyre|date=2017|title=The 2017 WArS/SAA Salary Survey: Initial Results and Analysis|url=https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/WArS-SAA-Salary-Survey-Report.pdf|journal=The Society of American Archivists|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>Therefore, this survey reflected about one quarter of the SAA membership in 2017.<ref name=\":4\" /> Of the total respondents, 87.7% were white and 84.3% were female.<ref name=\":4\" /> Only 3.1% responded stating they were African American, while 3.6% answered they were Latinx American and 3.2% said they were bi- or multi-racial.<ref name=\":4\" /> Over 92% stated that the highest education they'd received was a Master's degree.<ref name=\":4\" /> Since 1956, which had a membership of 33% women, the percentage of women membership has grown to be over 82%.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Today ===\nThe Roundtable is governed by two co-chairs who must be members of the SAA, and they are elected on staggered two-year terms. On their website, WAR states their mission is to \"ensure that the Society of American Archivists (SAA) conscientiously deals with issues that affect the status of women within the profession and the Society.\"<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/women-archivists-section/standing-rules|title=Standing Rules {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> Under their goals and objectives, they have aimed to:\n\n* Monitor the status of women within the archival profession.\n* Encourage the participation of women in all phases of SAA business and other activities as well as in the archival profession as a whole.\n* Monitor gender balance on SAA programs.\n* Nominate candidates for Fellow in SAA.\n* Monitor the continuance of day care at the SAA Annual Meeting.\n* Meet annually in conjunction with the SAA meeting.\n* Conduct its business in accordance with Section IX. of the SAA Governance Manual.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n== SAA Publications ==\nOn top of book publications, SAA offers the following regular publications:\n\n* ''[[American Archivist]]'': the peer-reviewed scholarly journal of SAA.

association|association]] in [[North America]], serving the [[education]]al and [[information]]al needs of more than 5,000 individual archivist and institutional members. Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.archivists.org/about/ | title=SAA: About SAA}}</ref>\n\nThe Society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as [[Encoded Archival Description]], the [[digitizing]] of archival materials, and [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]] and [[art conservation|conservation]] of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Society of American Archivist was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the [[American Historical Association]]. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The [[American Library Association]] created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=J. Frank|date=1983|title=The Blessings of Providence on an Association of Archivists|journal=The American Archivist|volume=46|issue=4|pages=374\u2013399|jstor=40292896|doi=10.17723/aarc.46.4.w7631q465t71h282}}</ref> There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by [[Margaret Cross Norton]] and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gilliland-Swetland|first=Luke|date=1991|title=The Provenance of a Profession: The Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival History|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=54|issue=2|pages=160\u2013175|doi=10.17723/aarc.54.2.w42580v137053675}}</ref> Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first issue of the Society's journal, the [[American Archivist|''American Archivist'',]] appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents.<ref name=\"&quot;Letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt to R.D.W. Connor&quot;\">{{cite journal|date=1942|title=News Notes|journal=American Archivist|publisher=Society of American Archivists|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119\u2013120}}</ref> After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the [[International Council on Archives]] and an archives for the United Nations.<ref name=\":0\" /> A number of committees focused on various interests of the Society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the Society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with [[National Association of State Libraries]] over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.\n\nBy the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists.<ref name=\":1\" /> These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Archives Power: Memory, Accountability, and Social Justice|last=Jimerson|first=Randall|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2009|isbn=978-1-931666-30-5|location=Chicago|pages=76\u2013129}}</ref> There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social historians like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Sam Bass Warner]] brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, a large portion of the Society's focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why.<ref name=\":2\" /> The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella.<ref name=\":2\" /> New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition]]<nowiki/>and a standard for encoding archival [[finding aid]]s, allowing them to be made accessible online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/das|title=Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Curriculum and Certificate Program {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018-2020, which outlined 4 major goal areas for the future. The 4 goal areas are advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members' needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/strategic-plan|title=SAA Strategic Plan {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable ==\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn the 1970s, the SAA began to collaborate with the American Association of Museums and the Association for State and Local History to form a Joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities in Museums, Archives, and Historical Agencies.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hankins|first=Rebecca|date=August 3, 2016|title=Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable (AACR) History|url=|journal=Archivists and Archives of Color Newsletter|volume=|pages=|via=Society of American Archivists}}</ref> Phil Mason and Elsie Freivogel were appointed but outreach to minority members of the SAA was poor. Many minorities were unaware of the Joint Committee and expressed that there had not been any direct communications from the committee's representatives.\n\nThe final report of the SAA Task Force on Diversity states:<blockquote>In 1972 SAA adopted the report of its Committee for the 1970s. Included among the Committee recommendations was a positive injunction to the nominating committee to make the Council more representative of and responsible to the diverse interests of the SAA by considering \"archival interest, age, sex, geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race in the selection of a slate of candidates.\"<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Adkins|first=Elizabeth W.|date=Spring-Summer 2008|title=Our Journey toward Diversity\u2014and a Call to (More) Action|journal=The American Archivist|volume=71|issue=1|pages=21\u201349|jstor=40294493}}</ref></blockquote>Also in the report, \"no person should be nominated as a candidate for an SAA office who, in her or his job, flagrantly espouses or practices discrimination in regard to race, sex, nationality, or political or religious ideology.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1978, the SAA established a joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities. However, the group languished in part from a lack of funds.\n\n=== 1980s: Task Force ===\nThe Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable began as a Task Force on Minorities within the SAA.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 1981, archivists Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Paula Williams drafted a resolution for the task force and members of the SAA approved the group.  Thomas Battle, who also chaired the SAA's Diversity Committee, was appointed the chairman of the Task Force and John Fleckner, Archie Motley, Daniel T. Williams, and Paula Williams were appointed members.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was chosen as the SAA representative for the Joint Committee on Minority Recruitment, replacing Phil Mason.\n\nIn the beginning, members noticed that the task force didn't have much representation. In an interview with AACR History, Karen Jefferson stated:<blockquote>\u201cAt the beginning of the minorities task force Native Americans, people of Latin American and Caribbean descent; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender were included under the umbrella of minorities. Although minorities share some broad experiences as minorities, each group has unique concerns specific to their culture and experience.\u201d<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>It wasn't until 1982 that a representative of Hispanic archivists was appointed: Idilio Garicia Pena. In its six years of existence, the task force made several recommendations to the SAA Council. These recommendations eventually became the foundation of the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable, and they still pusue them today. Some of their recommendations were to:<blockquote>\u25cf  Develop a roster of minorities working in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a membership committee to help in recruitment efforts for the Society.\n\n\u25cf  Develop a policy statement regarding recruitment of minorities.\n\n\u25cf  Develop an organizational handbook to increase membership\u2019s knowledge of the Society\u2019s structure and functions.\n\n\u25cf  Provide orientation for new members at the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Lower introductory dues rates for new members.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a single-day registration fee for the annual meeting.\n\n\u25cf  Seek funds to develop programs to address needs of minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Financially support SAA\u2019s own activities that are designed to address issues related to minorities in the profession.\n\n\u25cf  Establish a scholarship or fellowship to support the development of minorities in the profession.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=2016-08-25|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>Many of these goals were met and the creation of the task force proved immediately to be a vehicle for broader minority participation in the SAA, especially in leadership.\n\n=== 1980s: Roundtable ===\nIn 1987, the task force dissembled, restricted in their effectiveness because of a lack of interest and support from the SAA. The task force made the recommendation that a roundtable be created for minorities, which was formed the same year. Nine SAA members helped to found the roundtable: Diana Lachatanere, Wilda Logan, Carol Rudisell, Karen Jefferson, Ervin Jordan, Clifford Muse, Thomas Battle, Jo Ellen El-Bashir, and Brenda Banks.<ref name=\":02\" /> Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Carol Rudisell served as the coordinators. In September 1987, the AACR held their first meeting in New York City at the annual SAA conference. At this meeting, the structure of the roundtable was adopted with two co-chairs, one elected annually with elections every year.<ref name=\":02\" /> Their first year, Carol Rudisell and Donna Wells co-chaired while Diana Lachate\u00f1er\u00e9 was elected as chair of the Manuscript Section, declining to serve as co-chair.\n\nIt was not required to be a member of the SAA in order to participate in the roundtable. This allowed for a freer space in which the roundtable could interact with more minorities among the archival profession. But SAA membership would be encouraged and the chairpersons were required to be SAA members in good standing.\n\nThere was a lengthy debate on the name of the roundtable, varying from Minorities Roundtable to African American and Third World Archivists Roundtable. In 1994, the name was chosen to be the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Newsletter & Directory ====\nIn 1987, the roundtable began publishing a newsletter through the SAA, although not without objections from society members on costs. Thomas Battle then proposed that [[Howard University]] would completely fund the newsletter and even publish and distribute it for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivingincolor.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/wilda-d-logan/|title=Wilda D. Logan|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=Archivists and Archives of Color|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> These newsletters were available to anyone who was interested in African American archives, manuscripts and collections. In less than a year, Battle returned to the SAA with a high percentage of popularity and interest in the newsletter among not just African Americans but all archivists. This newsletter continued to be funded by Howard University and was later used as a model for other roundtables of the SAA.\n\nLachate\u00f1er\u00e9 and Rudisell were the first editors and after the first year, Karen Jefferson and Ruth Hill edited the newsletter. Other editors over the years include Kathryn Neal, Cathy Lynn Mundale, and Jo Ellen El-Bashir, who served one of the longest tenures as editor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2003, under editor Rose Roberta, the newsletter became available electronically and continues to be published online. Today, the newsletter continues to be the main source of communication for the roundtable members. The newsletter provides information on different members, institutions, the SAA, archives, and the activities and achievements of the roundtable.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn 1991, Carol Rudisell compiled the first membership directory with racial/ethnic heritage listed for the members. In 1996, this was compiled by Karen Jefferson in the ''Archivists of Color Directory''.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is not a directory on the entire membership of the roundtable but a directory of the archivists of color involved in the AACR. Each archivist has a brief biography, including their education, experience and the institutions they are affiliated with. In 2012, a directory was listed on the AACR website including only the name, job title and contact information of the archivist.\n\n==== Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award ====\nSeveral members of the roundtable, including [[Wilda Logan]], helped to establish the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award in 1993. This award is given to recognize graduate students of color who are actively working toward becoming professional archivists in the SAA.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://wp.nyu.edu/archivesandpublichistory/2010/01/15/harold-t-pinkett-minority-student-award/|title=Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award|last=Beaujon|first=Danielle J|date=January 15, 2010|website=Society of American Archivists|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> The award is sponsored by the AACR and funded through the SAA, named after [[Harold T. Pinkett]] who was the first African American archivist to serve at the National Archives.<ref name=\":22\" /> The SAA Council acknowledged the contributions of Harold T. Pinkett in this resolution:<blockquote>Whereas, Harold T. Pinkett served with distinction during his long tenure at the National Archives and Records Service; and Whereas Harold T. Pinkett has been a scholar, archival educator, and mentor who has made important contributions to the archives profession; Therefore be it resolved that in recognition of his lifetime achievements and contributions to the archival profession, the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable supports the renaming of the SAA Minority Student Award to the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award.</blockquote>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness (TFOE) was appointed in 1995-1996. One of the main issues of the task force was to address diversity in the SAA as well as in the archival profession.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this came the creation of the Task Force on Diversity, chaired by Brenda Banks with members Anne Difffendal, John Fleckner, Susan Fox, [[Karen Jefferson]], Deborah King (Burns), Joan Krizak, and [[Kathleen D. Roe|Kathleen Roe]]. The task force investigated the SAA to see where they supported or weakened diversity, discussing possible solutions to improve or encourage it in the SAA as well as the archival profession. Their final report recommended that the SAA:<blockquote>\n* Develop an organizational position statement that articulates SAA\u2019s commitment to becoming a more diverse organization\n* Incorporate diversity into SAA\u2019s strategic planning process.\n* Reinforce and expand existing activities within SAA that support diversity.\n* Identify and establish new initiatives that may assist SAA in its efforts to become a more diverse organization.<ref name=\":02\" />   \n</blockquote>After the Council accepted the report, they approved a statement on diversity that was released on June 13, 1999:<blockquote>The Society of American Archivists is committed to integrating diversity concerns and perspectives into all aspects of the activities and into the fabric of the profession as a whole.  SAA is also committed to the goal of a Society membership that reflects the broad diversity of American society.  SAA believes that these commitments are essential to the effective pursuit of the archival mission \u201cto ensure the identification, preservation, and use the nation\u2019s historical record.<ref name=\":02\" /></blockquote>Five years later, the SAA Council established a Committee on Diversity in response to complaints that they were moving slowly in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Diversity. After much debate, they established a Task Force on Diversity with its first goal to define 'diversity.'<ref name=\":32\" /> They were also asked to investigate \"how and to what extent issues of democracy are being addressed by the Society.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> The Task Force on Diversity submitted its last report in February 1999. In 1996, one of the few articles written on diversity in the archives profession was published. Kathryn M. Neal details the importance of diversity in archives:<blockquote>Expanding the numbers of staff members of color and tapping their potential should (and no doubt would) enhance the overall functions of archives and manuscript repositories. New ideas would likely be stimulated in areas that include, but certainly are not limited to, donor relations (for instance, how to approach and document members of growing communities of color most effectively) and reference/access (determining how to improve services as user groups become increasingly diverse, or how to attract a more diverse pool of researchers if society's changing demographics are not reflected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neal|first=Kathryn M.|date=1996|title=The Importance of Being Diverse: The Archival Profession and Minority Recruitment|url=|journal=Archival Issues|volume=|pages=145\u2013158|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Today ===\nMany of the original goals of the roundtable exist today. On their website, they have stated their purposes as to \"identify and address the concerns of archivists of African, Asian, Latino and Native American descent; promote wider participation of said archivists in the archival profession; and promote the preservation of archival materials that pertain to people of color.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, the roundtable still recognizes the need for more to be done for minorities, especially in archives. In a report made after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the AACR stated: \"As archivists, we cannot accept invisibility. As a profession, we cannot continue to accept historical erasure and whitewashing through binary historical practices.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuesandadvocacy.wordpress.com/tag/archivists-and-archives-of-color-roundtable/|title=LEADERS OF AACR, LACCHA, LAGAR ON ORLANDO & ARCHIVISTS' ROLE IN CREATING A MORE DIVERSE SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of American Archivists: Issues and Advocacy|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the SAA Council created a subcommittee to see the status of the SAA's diversity efforts. In May 2003, they reported that some of the recommendations by the Task Force on Diversity had been addressed while others had not, and the actions had not been effectively reported back to SAA members.<ref name=\":32\" /> The Council then voted for a Committee on Diversity. In August 2003, the Council approved the committee:<blockquote>The SAA Committee on Diversity works to ensure that the organization's services, activities, policies, communications, and products support the goal of a more diverse SAA and professional archival community. It functions as a catalyst for new diversity-related initiatives, developed in coordination with various SAA entities, and as the organization's \"conscience\" in monitoring, evaluating, advocating, and reporting on matters pertaining to the diversity of archival practitioners and documentation.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>In 2007, Elizabeth W. Adkins gave her presidential address at the SAA Annual Meeting in Chicago and highlighted the importance of diversity. \"SAA has been working to address diversity concerns for more than thirty-five years, sometimes effectively and sometimes not so effectively.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> In her speech, she focused on SAA's definition of diversity in comparison to others and how they have progressed.\n\nAdkins states that in 1982, only 2.8% of archivists were nonwhite but in 2004, that number jumped to 7%.<ref name=\":32\" /> SAA is only slightly better with about 10% of its members identifying as part of a minority or ethnic group. Adkins compares this with the national population, which is about 25% of nonwhite people, claiming \"both SAA and the profession have a very long way to go to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.\"<ref name=\":32\" /> But it's a start.\n\nSince 2002, Council meetings and discussion have consistently focused on diversity. Some of the approved motions on diversity from these meetings are:<blockquote>\u2022 Diversity has been and will be incorporated into every Council agenda for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 The Council, SAA staff, and all SAA units must report on diversity initiatives.\n\n\u2022 The president-elect and the Appointments Committee are required to report on the demographics of all committee appointments and on what was done to seek diversity in committee appointments.\n\n\u2022 The Program Committee and Host Committee must report on efforts to address diversity issues in the planning and scheduling of annual meeting programming.\n\n\u2022 The Diversity Committee has been asked to provide a report on the state of diversity at the annual business meeting each year.<ref name=\":32\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Women Archivists Section (WArS) ==\nThe Women Archivists Roundtable (WAR) monitors the status of women archivists and promotes the participation of women in the archives profession, specifically in areas of the Society of American Archivists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/women-archivists-section|title=Women Archivists Section {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nAlthough many women archivists helped shaped the SAA, the status of women in the archival profession didn't receive much attention until the 1970s.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://womenarchivistsroundtable.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2013-10-03|website=Women Archivists Section|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1972, the SAA established the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. The Committee sought to address under representation and identify the barriers and obstacles for advancement.<ref name=\":03\" /> The overall membership population of women had grown since the SAA's inception, but few had risen to the positions of president, officer, or council member.\n\nThe Committee conducted two surveys, one of archivists and one of directors. Through these surveys, the Committee discovered that although many women had comparable education and experience, few of them had risen to administrative positions.<ref>Deutrich, Mabel E. \u201cWomen in Archives: A Summary Report of the Committee of the Status of Women in the Archival Profession.\u201d ''The American Archivist 38'' (1975): 43-46.</ref>\n\nAt the same time that the Committee was created, the Women's Caucus was founded and began publishing ''The SAA Women's Caucus Newsletter''.<ref>Pacifico, Michele F. \u201cFounding Mothers: Women in the Society of American Archivist, 1936-1972.\u201d ''The American Archivist 50'' (1987): 389.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Committee evolved into the Women's Professional Archival Issues Roundtable.

It is composed of 1 Representative from an equal number of constituencies, each of whom is elected to a two-year term. Its members are not subject to [[term limits]]. The House meets at the [[Delaware State Capitol|Delaware Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].\n\n==Name==\nFrom 1776 to 1792, the chamber was known as the [[House of Assembly]], a common name for [[lower house]]s of colonial legislatures and states under the [[Articles of Confederation|Confederation]]. The name was changed by Delaware's [[Delaware Constitution of 1792|1792 Constitution]], reflecting the new federal [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. This change on the part of Delaware initiated a movement that has resulted in a majority of the lower houses of [[State legislature (United States)|U.S. state legislatures]] sharing the name of the federal House of Representatives.\n\n==Leadership==\nThe [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus followed by confirmation of the full House through the passage of a House Resolution. The Speaker is the chief leadership position of the body. The other House leaders are elected by their respective party caucuses. The Majority Leader determines which bills are brought to the floor for debate from an Agenda prepared by the Speaker of the House and manages debates and floor votes.\n\n[[Terry Spence]] (R) was the longest serving speaker in the history of the Delaware General Assembly.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
