Their home had two libraries &mdash; the first consisted of books on theology, the second was a large, varied collection. Looking back on his childhood, Orville once commented that he and his brother had\n:''\"special advantages...we were lucky enough to grow up in a home environment where there was always much encouragement to children to pursue intellectual interests; to investigate whatever aroused their curiosity.\"''<ref>[http://www.wright-house.com/wright-brothers/Wrights.html The Wright House website] Wilbur and Orville Wright</ref>\n\n=== Children ===\nSusan and Milton had seven [[children]]. Four sons and one daughter survived past infancy. Their first son, Reuchlin, was born in a log cabin in 1861 near [[Fairmount, Indiana]]. The second [[son]], Lorin, was born in 1862 in [[Orange Township, Fayette County, Indiana]]. Wilbur was born 16 April 1867 near [[Millville, Henry County, Indiana|Millville, Indiana]]. The fourth and fifth children, twins Otis and Ida, were born 25 February 1870 at [[Dayton, Ohio]], but died shortly thereafter, on 9 March and 14 March respectively, but were followed by the Dayton births of Orville on 19 August 1871, and Katharine, the only surviving [[daughter]], 19 August 1874.\n\nNone of the Wright [[children]] had middle names. Instead, their father tried hard to give them distinctive first names. Wilbur was named for [[Wilbur Fisk]] and Orville for [[Orville Dewey]], both clergymen that Milton Wright admired. They were \"Will\" and \"Orv\" to their friends, and \"Ullam\" and \"Bubs\" to each other. In Dayton, their neighbors knew them simply as the \"Bishop's kids.\"\n\nBecause of Milton's position in the church, the Wrights moved frequently &mdash; twelve times before finally returning permanently to Dayton in 1884.\n\n== Church service ==\nMilton joined the Church of the United Brethren in Christ in 1846 because of its stand on political and moral issues including alcohol, the abolition of [[slavery]], and opposition to \"secret societies\" such as [[Freemasonry]].\n\n===Indiana and Oregon===\nFrom 1855 to 1856 he served as [[pastor]] of the Church of the United Brethren in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. He was [[ordained]] in 1856 and was pastor in [[Andersonville, Indiana]] from 1856 to 1857. Later that year, he went to [[Oregon]] as a [[missionary]] and served as pastor at [[Sublimity, Oregon|Sublimity]] and first president of Sublimity College, a denominational institution.\n\nWright returned from Sublimity in 1859 and was assigned by the church as a [[circuit preacher]] in eastern [[Indiana]], where he served also served as presiding elder and pastor in [[Hartsville, Indiana]]. From 1868 to 1869 he was professor of theology at Hartsville College.\n\n===Ohio and Iowa===\nIn 1869, Milton became [[Editing|editor]] of the national weekly church newspaper, the '''''Religious Telescope''''', and moved to the newspaper's headquarters of [[Dayton, Ohio]]; with this new position, his income increased from $900 per year to $1500 per year.<ref name=mccullough>[[David McCullough]]. The Wright Brothers: The Dramatic Story-Behind-the-Story.

In 1878, he assumed responsibility for the Western conferences of the church and moved his family to [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. Westfield College in Illinois, gave him the degree of [[D.D.]] in 1878.\n\nHe traveled widely on church business, but always sent back many letters and often brought presents home. His gifts stimulated his children's curiosity and exposed them to a world beyond their immediate surroundings. Returning from one of his travels, he brought Wilbur and Orville a toy helicopter. The helicopter was made of bamboo, cork, paper and powered by rubber bands. When the first broke, the boys made several copies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytw11Bmxcz8C&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=milton+wright+helicopter+bamboo+paper&source=web&ots=I3zCgzL7Mt&sig=jwX4RG2Sl6Ek6c7x3AFP3PpWDTU  The Bishop's Boys: The Life of Wilbur and Orville Wright] excerpt</ref> The toy helicopter is responsible for triggering the Wright brothers interest in aviation.<ref name=\"WDL\"/>\n\n===Division in the church===\nBy 1881, the leadership of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ was becoming more [[Liberalism|liberal]]. Milton Wright, a staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]], failed to be re-elected to his Bishop's post. The Wrights moved to [[Richmond, Indiana]], where Milton served a [[circuit preacher]] once again. He served as presiding elder in the White River conference from 1881 to 1885. He also founded a monthly religious newspaper, '''''The Star''''', for fellow conservatives in 1883.\n\nAs the liberals in his church began to press for change, Milton Wright sensed there would be a showdown with the conservatives. Wanting to get back into the fray, he decided to move back to Dayton, the political center of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, in 1884. It was the last time he would move his family. Wright was once more elected bishop in 1885. He was to spend the next four years serving the Pacific Coast district.\n\nThe anticipated showdown came in 1889.  The church leadership wanted to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference, allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference, and allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies.  The procedure for amending the Constitution made amendments all but impossible, but the leadership made the changes anyway, saying they were necessary for the good of the church.\n\nHowever, a minority refused to accept the changes, claiming they weren't valid since they weren't approved by the full membership.  Wright was the only bishop to side with the minority. Wright and about 10,000 to 15,000 supporters left the meeting and reconvened at a new location. Contending that those supporting the changes had effectively seceded from the denomination, they declared themselves to be the true United Brethren Church. To distinguish themselves from the majority faction, the minority called itself the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution)]].\n\nWright became the new church's first bishop. Since they were in the minority, they had to rebuild from scratch; nearly all of the congregations who sided with the minority lost their property. Wright's sons Wilbur and Orville provided publishing services for the new organization until a publishing house could be established in [[Huntington, Indiana]]. Wright also provided valuable support to Huntington College (now [[Huntington University (United States)|Huntington University]], established by the Old Constitution branch in 1897.\n\n===Keiter controversy===\nAt the turn of the century, Wright was adamant about prosecuting the publishing house agent, Millard Keiter, who was accused of embezzling. Many members of the publishing board supported Keiter. Because of the controversy, Wright's home district, the White River Conference, voted to rescind his license as minister. The General Conference overruled the home conference in 1905, reinstating Wright. Keiter moved to [[Kentucky]], where he was indicted for land fraud.\n\n===Retirement===\nMilton Wright retired in 1905.  He died in 1917.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Bishops of the United Methodist Church]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Milton Wright}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060129100550/http://www.huntington.edu/mag/HC-mag-2003-Fall.pdf Huntington College Magazine]\n* [http://wright.nasa.gov/index.htm NASA Reliving the Wright Way]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051217175553/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/index.cfm Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum The Wright Brothers]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050412103239/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Wright_Bros/wright_family/WR1.htm US Centennial of Flight Commission &mdash; Wright Family]\n\n{{Wright aircraft|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wright, Milton}}\n[[Category:1828 births]]\n[[Category:1917 deaths]]\n[[Category:American Methodist missionaries]]\n[[Category:American newspaper editors]]\n[[Category:American people of Dutch descent]]\n[[Category:American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:American religion academics]]\n[[Category:American United Brethren in Christ]]\n[[Category:Bishops of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]\n[[Category:Methodist missionaries in the United States]]\n[[Category:Editors of Christian publications]]\n[[Category:Evangelical United Brethren missionaries]]\n[[Category:People from Columbus, Indiana]]\n[[Category:People from Dayton, Ohio]]\n[[Category:United Brethren in Christ clergy]]\n[[Category:Wright brothers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum]]\n[[Category:Bishops in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Wright family]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Father of the Orville brothers, protestant bishop}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name=Milton Wright\n|image=Milton Wright 1889.jpg\n|caption=Wright circa 1889\n|birth_date=November 17, 1828\n|birth_place=[[Rushville Township, Rush County, Indiana|Rushville, Rush County, Indiana]]\n|death_date={{death date and age|1917|4|3|1828|11|17}}\n|death_place=[[Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio]]\n|occupation=[[Bishop]] of the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11372/ |title = Telegram from Orville Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to His Father Announcing Four Successful Flights, 1903 December 17 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1903-12-17 |accessdate = 2013-07-21 }}</ref>\n|known_for= Father of the [[Wright brothers]]; Founder of [[United Theological Seminary]]\n|parents=Dan Wright <br> Catherine Wright (Reeder)\n|spouse=[[Susan Catherine Koerner Wright]]\n|children=Reuchlin Wright <br> Lorin Wright <br> [[Wilbur Wright]] <br> Otis Wright <br> Ida Wright <br> [[Orville Wright]] <br> [[Katharine Wright]]\n|resting_place=[[Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum]], Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, [[United States|U.S]]\n}}\n\n'''Milton Wright''' (November 17, 1828 &ndash; April 3, 1917) was the father of aviation pioneers [[Wilbur and Orville Wright]], and a [[Bishop]] of the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]].
