The AAU, which had run amateur hockey in the United States since 1930, was expelled by the IIHF in 1947 when it refused to support a team composed of players from the AHAUS, which the AAU accused of being \"openly paid salaries\".<ref name=\"Num82\">{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-82.html Story #82\u2013USA sends two teams to the 1948 Olympics].</ref> The Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee had accepted the AHAUS's application, but [[Avery Brundage]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) threatened to ban the entire American team if the AHAUS participated in the Olympics. The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey from the Games if the AHAUS was banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee rejected this proposal. The IOC decided to switch hockey to an unofficial event but relented when a compromise was reached. The AHAUS team was allowed to compete but would not be considered an official participant or allowed to win a medal. The AAU team marched in the opening ceremony and then left Switzerland. Because this tournament was also the LIHG (forerunner of the [[IIHF]]) World Championship, the AHAUS team maintained a fourth place in that ranking.<ref>[http://www.passionhockey.com/hockeyarchives/JO1948.htm Results and commentary in french]</ref>\n\n==Participating nations==\n{{see also|Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics \u2013 Rosters}}\n* {{flagIOC|AUT|1948 Winter|15}}\n* {{flagIOC|CAN|1948 Winter|12}}\n* {{flagIOC|TCH|1948 Winter|17}}\n* {{flagIOC|GBR|1948 Winter|14}}\n* {{flagIOC|ITA|1948 Winter|17}}\n* {{flagIOC|POL|1948 Winter|17}}\n* {{flagIOC|SUI|1948 Winter|17}}\n* {{flagIOC|SWE|1948 Winter|16}}\n* {{flagIOC|USA|1948 Winter|14}}\n\n==Final tournament==\nThe tournament was run in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format with nine teams participating.

While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.\n\nThe story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/\"torch-shiner\" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.\n\nWith the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha ([[Sruthi Hariharan]]) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.\n\nIn the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.\n\nIn the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a \"torch-shiner\" projected on the walls of the room.\n\nShwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.\n\nAt present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \"torch-shiner\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.\n \nSanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.\n\nAt the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sathish Ninasam]] as Nikki/Nikhil\n* [[Sruthi Hariharan]] as Shwetha\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]] as Shankranna\n* Sanjay as Sanjay (Mumbai police)\n*  Krishna as Deepak (Crime branch officer)\n* Balaji Manohar\n* Hardika Shetty as Kamini\n* Aaryan Achukatla as Aryan (second lead/model)\n* Ram Manjjonaath\n* Venky\n*[[Rishab Shetty]]\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2011 [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] announced on the Web that his next project, after the success of his directorial debut film ''[[Lifeu Ishtene]]'', was going to be ''Lucia''. For the next two months, he met quite a few producers and top actors and found it difficult to fund his film. That led Pawan Kumar to write a post titled Making Enemies on his blog. Three days after it was published, the response was so overwhelming that he decided to pitch the idea of inviting people to produce the film and Pawan Kumar initiated Project Lucia.<ref>[http://postnoon.com/2013/05/26/swimming-against-thetide/127211 Swimming Against TheTide : Postnoon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653 Project Lucia | Pawan Kumar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lucia is notable for its use of [[crowdfunding]].

[[Requiem for a Dream]] is also seen playing on a TV in the same scene which is also an influence as the movie deals with addiction.<ref>http://imdb.com/title/tt2358592/trivia</ref> Apart from the cinematic influences, the theme of dream and illusion is also shown as an influence of the poem Nee Mayeyolago by [[Kanaka Dasa]] which is quoted at the beginning of the movie. The poem is also partially contained in the lyrics of the song Nee Toreda Galigeyali in the soundtrack. Crowdfunding in Kannada movies was another phenomenon that Pawan kick-started. Since then young filmmakers have started to follow CrowdFunding as one of the source for producing their movies like Sushupti Dreams team.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released in Blu-ray, HD DVD, DVD 5.1, VCD Version From Anand Video Studio.

While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.\n\nThe story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/\"torch-shiner\" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.\n\nWith the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha ([[Sruthi Hariharan]]) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.\n\nIn the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.\n\nIn the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a \"torch-shiner\" projected on the walls of the room.\n\nShwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.\n\nAt present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \"torch-shiner\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.\n \nSanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.\n\nAt the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sathish Ninasam]] as Nikki/Nikhil\n* [[Sruthi Hariharan]] as Shwetha\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]] as Shankranna\n* Sanjay as Sanjay (Mumbai police)\n*  Krishna as Deepak (Crime branch officer)\n* Balaji Manohar\n* Hardika Shetty as Kamini\n* Aaryan Achukatla as Aryan (second lead/model)\n* Ram Manjjonaath\n* Venky\n*[[Rishab Shetty]]\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2011 [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] announced on the Web that his next project, after the success of his directorial debut film ''[[Lifeu Ishtene]]'', was going to be ''Lucia''. For the next two months, he met quite a few producers and top actors and found it difficult to fund his film. That led Pawan Kumar to write a post titled Making Enemies on his blog. Three days after it was published, the response was so overwhelming that he decided to pitch the idea of inviting people to produce the film and Pawan Kumar initiated Project Lucia.<ref>[http://postnoon.com/2013/05/26/swimming-against-thetide/127211 Swimming Against TheTide : Postnoon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653 Project Lucia | Pawan Kumar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lucia is notable for its use of [[crowdfunding]].

Originally released in 2001 for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[PlayStation 2]], the game was re-released as ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster]]'' for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2013, for [[PlayStation 4]] in 2015, [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2016, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2019. The game marks the ''Final Fantasy'' series transition from entirely [[pre-rendered]] backdrops to fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] areas, and is also the first in the series to feature [[voice acting]]. ''Final Fantasy X'' replaces the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\".\n\nSet in the fantasy world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]], a setting influenced by the [[Australasia|South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and [[Japan]],<ref name=\"producer\" /> the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The [[player character]] is [[Tidus]], a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in Spira after Sin destroyed his home city of Zanarkand. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]] [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.\n\nDevelopment of ''Final Fantasy X'' began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million (US${{Inflation|US|32.3|1999|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]; [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]] were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. ''Final Fantasy X'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million units worldwide on PlayStation 2. It is considered to be one of [[List of video games considered the best|the greatest video games of all time]]. On March 13, 2003, it was followed by ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', making it the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have a direct game sequel.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy X'' differs from that of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in its lack of a [[top-down perspective]] [[overworld|world map]]. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In ''Final Fantasy X'', almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an [[airships in video games|airship]] becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' features numerous [[minigame]]s, most notably the fictional underwater sport \"blitzball\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |title=Final Fantasy X Preview |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation |first=Dave |last=Zdyrko |date=November 26, 2001 |accessdate=December 14, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063418/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:FFXbattleexample.png|thumb|left|A [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle using a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] to illustrate battle information]]\n\n''Final Fantasy X'' introduces the ''Conditional Turn-Based Battle'' system in place of the series' traditional ''Active Time Battle'' system first used in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure.<ref name=\"GSpy\" /> A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-x/1100-2798161/|title=Final Fantasy X|last=Vestal|first=Andrew|date=April 28, 2003|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=July 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620130705/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-x/1100-2798161/|archive-date=June 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"[[Limit Break]]s\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in ''Final Fantasy X'' as \"Overdrives\". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |title=Final Fantasy X \u2013 Review |publisher=RPGamer |author=Tidwell, Mickel |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621054222/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |archivedate=June 21, 2013  }}</ref>\n\n''Final Fantasy X'' introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" of ''Final Fantasy X'' arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sphere Grid===\nAs with previous titles in the series, players have the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional [[experience point]] system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after [[Levels up|leveling up]], each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.<ref name=\"GSpy\" />\n\nThe Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the [[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|White Mage]]-roled Yuna into a healer and the [[swordsman]] Auron into a physical powerhouse. The ''International'' and [[PAL region|PAL]] versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.<ref name=\"International\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |title=Final Fantasy X International |publisher=RPGFan |first=James Quentin |last=Clark |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012751/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Blitzball ===\nBlitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers.<ref name=\":1\" /> The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/|title=Final Fantasy X Review|last=Kasavin|first=Greg|date=December 14, 2001|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBlitzball is first introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria.

It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by [[human]]s, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language.<ref name=aftersalvage /><ref name=blame /> The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other [[arboreal]] features. Still less human are the [[lion]]-like Ronso and the [[frog]]-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"[[Four Fiends|fiends]]\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game;<ref name=sending /> however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to [[elephant]]s); and the [[emu]]-like [[chocobo]], which appears in most ''Final Fantasy'' games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, being much more closely modeled on [[Southeast Asia]], most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.<ref name=producer />\n\nThere are seven main [[player character|playable characters]] in ''Final Fantasy X'', starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira.<ref name=aftersalvage /> To do so, he joins Yuna, a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\".<ref name=\"day of departure\"/> Journeying with them are: [[Kimahri Ronso]], a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood;<ref name=\"kimarhi ronso\"/> [[Wakka (Final Fantasy)|Wakka]], a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin;<ref name=wakka /><ref name=chappu /> and [[Lulu (Final Fantasy)|Lulu]], a [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[Final Fantasy character classes#Black Mage|black mage]] close to Yuna and Wakka.<ref name=\"day of departure\"/> During the journey, they are joined by [[\u0100ron|Auron]], a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior;<ref name=\"auron at luca\"/> and [[Rikku]], Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.<ref name=aftersalvage />\n\n===Story===\nTidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city.<!-- No one knows what city the ruins are from until later in the game. --> He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Zanarkand|Zanarkand]], where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\".<ref name=\"sin\"/> Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.<ref name=\"aftersalvage\"/>\n\nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus.

Originally released in 2001 for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[PlayStation 2]], the game was re-released as ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster]]'' for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2013, for [[PlayStation 4]] in 2015, [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2016, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2019. The game marks the ''Final Fantasy'' series transition from entirely [[pre-rendered]] backdrops to fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] areas, and is also the first in the series to feature [[voice acting]]. ''Final Fantasy X'' replaces the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\".\n\nSet in the fantasy world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]], a setting influenced by the [[Australasia|South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and [[Japan]],<ref name=\"producer\" /> the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The [[player character]] is [[Tidus]], a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in Spira after Sin destroyed his home city of Zanarkand. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]] [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.\n\nDevelopment of ''Final Fantasy X'' began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million (US${{Inflation|US|32.3|1999|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. ''Final Fantasy X'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million units worldwide on PlayStation 2. It is considered to be one of [[List of video games considered the best|the greatest video games of all time]]. On March 13, 2003, it was followed by ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', making it the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have a direct game sequel.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy X'' differs from that of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in its lack of a [[top-down perspective]] [[overworld|world map]]. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In ''Final Fantasy X'', almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an [[airships in video games|airship]] becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' features numerous [[minigame]]s, most notably the fictional underwater sport \"blitzball\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |title=Final Fantasy X Preview |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation |first=Dave |last=Zdyrko |date=November 26, 2001 |accessdate=December 14, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063418/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134008p1.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:FFXbattleexample.png|thumb|left|A [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle using a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] to illustrate battle information]]\n\n''Final Fantasy X'' introduces the ''Conditional Turn-Based Battle'' system in place of the series' traditional ''Active Time Battle'' system first used in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure.<ref name=\"GSpy\" /> A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-x/1100-2798161/|title=Final Fantasy X|last=Vestal|first=Andrew|date=April 28, 2003|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=July 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620130705/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-x/1100-2798161/|archive-date=June 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"[[Limit Break]]s\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in ''Final Fantasy X'' as \"Overdrives\". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |title=Final Fantasy X \u2013 Review |publisher=RPGamer |author=Tidwell, Mickel |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621054222/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff10/reviews/ff10strev1.html |archivedate=June 21, 2013  }}</ref>\n\n''Final Fantasy X'' introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" of ''Final Fantasy X'' arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sphere Grid===\nAs with previous titles in the series, players have the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional [[experience point]] system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after [[Levels up|leveling up]], each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.<ref name=\"GSpy\" />\n\nThe Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the [[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|White Mage]]-roled Yuna into a healer and the [[swordsman]] Auron into a physical powerhouse. The ''International'' and [[PAL region|PAL]] versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.<ref name=\"International\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |title=Final Fantasy X International |publisher=RPGFan |first=James Quentin |last=Clark |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012751/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-intl/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Blitzball ===\nBlitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers.<ref name=\":1\" /> The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/|title=Final Fantasy X Review|last=Kasavin|first=Greg|date=December 14, 2001|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBlitzball is first introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria.

It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by [[human]]s, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language.<ref name=aftersalvage /><ref name=blame /> The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other [[arboreal]] features. Still less human are the [[lion]]-like Ronso and the [[frog]]-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"[[Four Fiends|fiends]]\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game;<ref name=sending /> however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to [[elephant]]s); and the [[emu]]-like [[chocobo]], which appears in most ''Final Fantasy'' games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, being much more closely modeled on [[Southeast Asia]], most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.<ref name=producer />\n\nThere are seven main [[player character|playable characters]] in ''Final Fantasy X'', starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira.<ref name=aftersalvage /> To do so, he joins Yuna, a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\".<ref name=\"day of departure\"/> Journeying with them are: [[Kimahri Ronso]], a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood;<ref name=\"kimarhi ronso\"/> [[Wakka (Final Fantasy)|Wakka]], a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin;<ref name=wakka /><ref name=chappu /> and [[Lulu (Final Fantasy)|Lulu]], a [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[Final Fantasy character classes#Black Mage|black mage]] close to Yuna and Wakka.<ref name=\"day of departure\"/> During the journey, they are joined by [[\u0100ron|Auron]], a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior;<ref name=\"auron at luca\"/> and [[Rikku]], Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.<ref name=aftersalvage />\n\n===Story===\nTidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city.<!-- No one knows what city the ruins are from until later in the game. --> He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline.<ref name=\"introduction\"/> It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Zanarkand|Zanarkand]], where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\".<ref name=\"sin\"/> Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.<ref name=\"aftersalvage\"/>\n\nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus.

It is the smallest [[Historic counties of England|historic county in England]] and the fourth smallest in the UK as a whole. Because of this, the [[Latin]] [[motto]] ''Multum in Parvo'' or \"much in little\" was adopted by the county council in 1950.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott-Giles |first=C Wilfrid |authorlink=Wilfrid Scott-Giles |title=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition |year=1953 |publisher=[[J.

The former [[County of London]], in existence 1889 to 1965, also had a smaller area.  It is 323rd of the [[List of English districts|326 districts]] in population.\n\nThe only towns in Rutland are [[Oakham]], the [[county town]], and [[Uppingham]]. At the centre of the county is [[Rutland Water]], a large artificial [[Water reservoir|reservoir]] that is an important nature reserve serving as an overwintering site for [[wildfowl]] and a breeding site for [[osprey]]s.\n\nRutland's older cottages are built from [[limestone]] or [[ironstone]] and many have roofs of [[Collyweston stone slate]] or [[thatch]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name of the county is unclear. In a 1909 edition of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' Harriot Tabor suggested \"that the name should be Ruthland, and that there is a part of [[Essex]] called the Ruth, and that the ancient holders of it were called Ruthlanders, since altered to Rutland\";<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tabor |first=Harriot |title=Rutland: Origin of the Name |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |date=February 1909 |page=170 }}</ref> however, responses suggest \"that Rutland, as a name, was earlier than the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]. Its first mention, as \"Roteland\", occurs in the will of [[Edward the Confessor]]; in [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] it is \"the King's [[soke (legal)|soc]] of Roteland\", not being then a shire; and in the reign of [[John, King of England|John]] it was assigned as a dowry to [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= W.B.H. |title=Rutland: Origin of the Name |journal=Notes and Queries |date=April 1909 |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part of the county was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of [[Nottinghamshire]], in [[Domesday Book]]; the south-eastern part as the [[wapentake]] of ''Wicelsea'' in [[Northamptonshire]]. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the '[[Soke (legal)|Soke]] of Rutland'. Historically it was also known as '''Rutlandshire''', but in recent times only the shorter name is common.\n\nRutland may be from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hry\u00fer}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|hrythr}}'' \"cattle\" and ''{{lang|ang|land}}'' \"land\", as a record from 1128 as ''Ritelanede'' shows. However, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names'' by A D Mills gives an alternative etymology, \"Rota's land\", from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) personal name and ''land'' land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t40.e11276 |title=Rutland |first=A D |last=Mills |year=2003 |work=A Dictionary of British Place-Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=24 April 2010 }}</ref> It is from the alternative interpretation of ''red land'' that the traditional nickname for a male person from Rutland, a \"Raddle Man\", derives.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Joad |editor-first=C.E.M. |title=The English Counties Illustrated |year=1948 |publisher=Odhams Press |page=307 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Rutland}}\n[[File:Clipsham Yew Tree Avenue - Rutland County Council - geograph.org.uk - 1533637.jpg|thumb|Topiary with date at [[Clipsham]] Yew Tree Avenue, marking Rutland's<br> re-establishment in 1997]]\nEarl of Rutland and [[Duke of Rutland]] are titles in the [[peerage]] of England held in the Manners family, derived from the historic county of Rutland. The Earl of Rutland was elevated to the status of [[Duke]] in 1703 and the titles were merged. The family seat is [[Belvoir Castle]], Leicestershire.\n\nThe office of [[High Sheriff of Rutland]] was instituted in 1129, and there has been a [[Lord Lieutenant of Rutland]] since at least 1559.\n\nBy the time of the 19th century it had been divided into the [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s of [[Alstoe]], East Rutland, Martinsley, [[Oakham]] and Wrandike.\n\nRutland covered parts of three [[poor law union]]s and [[rural sanitary district]]s (RSDs): those of Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford. The [[registration county]] of Rutland contained the entirety of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs, which included several parishes in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire \u2013 the eastern part in Stamford RSD was included in the Lincolnshire registration county. Under the Poor Laws, Oakham Union workhouse was built in 1836\u201337 at a site to the north-east of the town, with room for 100 paupers. The building later operated as the Catmose Vale Hospital, and now forms part of the [[Oakham School]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham/Oakham.shtml Workhouses website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006110956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham%2FOakham.shtml |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three [[rural district]]s. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the [[Oakham Rural District]] and [[Uppingham Rural District]], with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the [[Melton Mowbray Rural District]], the nine parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the [[Hallaton Rural District]], and the six parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming [[Gretton Rural District]]. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the [[Ketton Rural District]].\n\n[[Oakham Urban District]] was created from Oakham Rural District in 1911. It was subsequently abolished in 1974.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10106620 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923120100/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10106620 |date=23 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRutland was included in the \"East Midlands General Review Area\" of the 1958\u201367 [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission for England]]. Draft recommendations would have seen Rutland split, with [[Ketton Rural District]] going along with [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] to a new administrative county of [[Cambridgeshire]], and the western part added to [[Leicestershire]]. The final proposals were less radical and instead proposed that Rutland become a single [[rural district]] within the administrative county of Leicestershire.<ref>Little Rutland To Go It Alone \u2013 No Merger with Leicestershire. ''The Times'', 2 August 1963.</ref>\n\n===District of Leicestershire (1974\u20131997)===\nRutland became a [[non-metropolitan district]] of Leicestershire under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which took effect on 1 April 1974. The original proposal was for Rutland to be merged with what is now the  [[Melton (borough)|Melton borough]], as Rutland did not meet the requirement of having a population of at least 40,000. The revised and implemented proposals allowed Rutland to be exempt from this.\n\n===Unitary authority (1997\u2013present)===\nIn 1994, the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]], which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a [[unitary authority]]. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, when [[Rutland County Council]] became responsible for almost all local services in Rutland, with the exception of the [[Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[Leicestershire Police]], which are run by [[Local Government in the United Kingdom#joint-boards|joint boards]] with [[Leicestershire County Council]] and [[Leicester City Council]].

It is 323rd of the [[List of English districts|326 districts]] in population.\n\nThe only towns in Rutland are [[Oakham]], the [[county town]], and [[Uppingham]]. At the centre of the county is [[Rutland Water]], a large artificial [[Water reservoir|reservoir]] that is an important nature reserve serving as an overwintering site for [[wildfowl]] and a breeding site for [[osprey]]s.\n\nRutland's older cottages are built from [[limestone]] or [[ironstone]] and many have roofs of [[Collyweston stone slate]] or [[thatch]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name of the county is unclear.

Its first mention, as \"Roteland\", occurs in the will of [[Edward the Confessor]]; in [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] it is \"the King's [[soke (legal)|soc]] of Roteland\", not being then a shire; and in the reign of [[John, King of England|John]] it was assigned as a dowry to [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= W.B.H. |title=Rutland: Origin of the Name |journal=Notes and Queries |date=April 1909 |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part of the county was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of [[Nottinghamshire]], in [[Domesday Book]]; the south-eastern part as the [[wapentake]] of ''Wicelsea'' in [[Northamptonshire]]. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the '[[Soke (legal)|Soke]] of Rutland'. Historically it was also known as '''Rutlandshire''', but in recent times only the shorter name is common.\n\nRutland may be from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hry\u00fer}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|hrythr}}'' \"cattle\" and ''{{lang|ang|land}}'' \"land\", as a record from 1128 as ''Ritelanede'' shows.

The family seat is [[Belvoir Castle]], Leicestershire.\n\nThe office of [[High Sheriff of Rutland]] was instituted in 1129, and there has been a [[Lord Lieutenant of Rutland]] since at least 1559.\n\nBy the time of the 19th century it had been divided into the [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s of [[Alstoe]], East Rutland, Martinsley, [[Oakham]] and Wrandike.\n\nRutland covered parts of three [[poor law union]]s and [[rural sanitary district]]s (RSDs): those of Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford. The [[registration county]] of Rutland contained the entirety of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs, which included several parishes in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire \u2013 the eastern part in Stamford RSD was included in the Lincolnshire registration county. Under the Poor Laws, Oakham Union workhouse was built in 1836\u201337 at a site to the north-east of the town, with room for 100 paupers. The building later operated as the Catmose Vale Hospital, and now forms part of the [[Oakham School]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham/Oakham.shtml Workhouses website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006110956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham%2FOakham.shtml |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three [[rural district]]s. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the [[Oakham Rural District]] and [[Uppingham Rural District]], with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the [[Melton Mowbray Rural District]], the nine parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the [[Hallaton Rural District]], and the six parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming [[Gretton Rural District]]. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the [[Ketton Rural District]].\n\n[[Oakham Urban District]] was created from Oakham Rural District in 1911. It was subsequently abolished in 1974.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10106620 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923120100/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10106620 |date=23 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRutland was included in the \"East Midlands General Review Area\" of the 1958\u201367 [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission for England]]. Draft recommendations would have seen Rutland split, with [[Ketton Rural District]] going along with [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] to a new administrative county of [[Cambridgeshire]], and the western part added to [[Leicestershire]]. The final proposals were less radical and instead proposed that Rutland become a single [[rural district]] within the administrative county of Leicestershire.<ref>Little Rutland To Go It Alone \u2013 No Merger with Leicestershire. ''The Times'', 2 August 1963.</ref>\n\n===District of Leicestershire (1974\u20131997)===\nRutland became a [[non-metropolitan district]] of Leicestershire under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which took effect on 1 April 1974. The original proposal was for Rutland to be merged with what is now the  [[Melton (borough)|Melton borough]], as Rutland did not meet the requirement of having a population of at least 40,000. The revised and implemented proposals allowed Rutland to be exempt from this.\n\n===Unitary authority (1997\u2013present)===\nIn 1994, the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]], which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a [[unitary authority]]. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, when [[Rutland County Council]] became responsible for almost all local services in Rutland, with the exception of the [[Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[Leicestershire Police]], which are run by [[Local Government in the United Kingdom#joint-boards|joint boards]] with [[Leicestershire County Council]] and [[Leicester City Council]]. Rutland regained a separate [[Lord Lieutenant of Rutland|lieutenancy]] and [[high sheriff|shrievalty]], and thus also regained status as a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].\n\nRutland was a [[postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] until the [[Royal Mail]] integrated it into the Leicestershire postal county in 1974.

Rutland Water, when construction started in 1971, became Europe's largest man-made lake; construction was completed in 1975, and filling the lake took a further four years.
