Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sporadic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sporadic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

As Reznor explains in an interview with ''Convulsion Magazine'':\n\n<blockquote>There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it&nbsp;... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere&nbsp;... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = \"Shock\" /> Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=81\u201382}} In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Court Holds Reznor/Malm Contract Not Unconscionable|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005155/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|archivedate=June 13, 2015}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.<ref name = \"E!

{"title_page": "1934 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1934 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 26th. The senior championship was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] who ran away with the title with an 11 win, 2 loss record. Such was their dominance that the league didn't bother playing the 14th round as Richmond had a 6-point lead over their nearest competitor. The Richmond reserve grade team also won the title which was remarkable in that they lost their first two matches before reeling off 12 consecutive wins to claim the title. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition with a 20 to 13 win over [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Richmond's remarkable season also included the Stormont Shield which they won 21 to 5 over [[Newton Rangers]], while their reserve grade team also won the Stallard Cup knockout competition when they beat [[City Rovers|City Rovers Reserves]] 21 to 9. Richmond also recorded two wins over the touring [[West Tigers|Western Suburbs]] side who had won the New South Wales premiership with 18\u201316 and 10\u20133 point wins. This was arguably the strongest set of results of any club at the senior level in Auckland Rugby League's history to this point.\n\nThe Roope Rooster competition saw the debut of the [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] and [[Papakura Sea Eagles|Papakura]] senior teams playing in a senior A grade competition with both sides playing on [[Carlaw Park]] # 2 field. Both teams performed meritoriously before Mt Albert went down to Ponsonby 19 to 11, and Papakura lost to Marist 6 points to 3.\n\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team had a successful season recording wins over [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] by 35 to 8, [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]] 19 to 12, and South Auckland by 36 to 16. The season also saw the first ever match for an official Auckland M\u0101ori team which played under the name Tamaki. They hosted [[Waikato rugby league team|Lower Waikato]] in a Waitangi Maori Shield match which they won 36 to 13.\n\n==Auckland Rugby League Meetings==\nAt the annual meeting of the junior management committee on 20 March the report they received showed that the number of players and clubs had increased by over 11 percent and 14 percent respectively. The registration fees were an increase on 1932 by \u00a312 4/6. Mr. D. Wilkie was elected chairman, Mr. E. Chapman deputy chairman, while Mr. Mr. W. F. Clarke elected secretary to replace the long serving and retiring Mr. T. R. Davis.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Junior Management/Annual Meeting Business\n| page = 15\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXV| issue=68\n| date = 1934-03-21\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340321.2.158\n| accessdate = 2019-12-02}}</ref> Davis was later appointed as a life member of New Zealand Rugby League, as was Arthur Ball (ex-chairman of the Auckland Rugby League Referees\u2019 Association, and C.

The gate takings were over \u00a3400 being available as grants to senior clubs in 1933. The working gate takings were \u00a31,953 12/9 from club matches (an increase of \u00a3158). Ground rents of \u00a3154 7/ were lower but profits of \u00a3196 18/ were recorded from matches with visiting provincial teams. Registered player fees accounted for \u00a399 12/ and this combined with donations and the earlier stated income meant total receipts of \u00a32,636 2/5. Expenditure was \u00a3487 17/6 on ground rents, \u00a3340 17/2 on maintenance and upkeep of the park and grounds, \u00a3175 on staffing grounds and cost to officials, and minor expenses. This meant a balance of \u00a321 4\u20198 to be carried forward. The profit and loss account showed a surplus of assets valued at \u00a36,415 19/7. Reference was also made to the services of George Rhodes who had passed away at the end of the 1933 season after many years as chairman of the league.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Rugby League/Game in Auckland/Last Season Reviewed\n| page = 16\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXV| issue=82\n| date = 1934-04-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340407.2.125\n| accessdate = 2019-12-02}}</ref> At the annual meeting the following officers were elected: patron, Mr. J.

They had more control over the players than did New Zealand. The object... was to get the teams on the ground in the best condition possible. They believed that the team \u201cthat gets in first\u201d gave the others a handicap that took some getting over during the season, and no time and money were spared in preparation\u201d.\n\n==Broadcast of Matches from Carlaw Park==\nThe district radio engineer, Mr. L. L. Macey stated that there was \u201cno ban on the broadcasting of Rugby League football in Auckland\u201d, however the station 1ZB was going to be unable to broadcast matches. The reason being that its application for an extension of broadcasting hours had been turned down by Wellington and as the football was played outside of their broadcast hours they would be unable to carry any coverage.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Football Broadcast/Departmental Attitude/Question of Hours\n| page = 8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXV| issue=98\n| date = 1934-04-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340427.2.115\n| accessdate = 2019-12-03}}</ref> The decision was met by indignation from New Zealand Rugby League and it was decided to strongly protest and follow up with other action.<ref name=\"annual_meeting\" /> The protest entailed an immediate telegraph to the Postmaster General \u201cagainst unfair discrimination at the cost of the many supporters of the game who paid for licenses as listeners... the executive also was requested to communicate with individual members of Parliament on the subject, and the incoming committee was urged to take further action, if necessary, as it was a matter of urgency to the code and to the general public\u201d. 1ZB had applied two months earlier and was ready to begin broadcasting from the opening weekend of matches however the decision not to allow it had occurred in the days prior to the season opening. Rugby Union was going to be broadcast out of the Broadcasting Boards own funds, and soccer was going to be broadcast through 1YA. Chairman of New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. Cyril Sneddon said \u201cwell, it looks as though there is at the moment a ban, or threatened ban, on Rugby League football \u2013 just another tilt at the code\u201d. There were many other accusations of \u201cstrings being pulled\u201d made by delegates from around the regions.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =League Broadcast/Permission Refused/Discrimination Alleged/Immediate Protest\n| page = 13\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXV| issue=98\n| date = 1934-04-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340427.2.164\n| accessdate = 2019-12-03}}</ref> It was decided by the Hon.

They cut out a portion of their Saturday morning programme to make room for the afternoon broadcast of the league. This meant that they did not need to apply to an extension of their hours. The decision was met very favourably by league chairman Campbell who said \u201cwe are very pleased with the result... listeners in the country districts especially will appreciate the action of 1ZB in meeting that has become a widespread demand for the broadcasting of League matches from Carlaw Park\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Carlaw Park Broadcasts/Adjustment of Programme\n| page = 8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXV| issue=127\n| date = 1934-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340531.2.78\n| accessdate = 2019-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Life Membership==\nMr. T.

The senior championship was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] who ran away with the title with an 11 win, 2 loss record. Such was their dominance that the league didn't bother playing the 14th round as Richmond had a 6-point lead over their nearest competitor. The Richmond reserve grade team also won the title which was remarkable in that they lost their first two matches before reeling off 12 consecutive wins to claim the title. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition with a 20 to 13 win over [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Richmond's remarkable season also included the Stormont Shield which they won 21 to 5 over [[Newton Rangers]], while their reserve grade team also won the Stallard Cup knockout competition when they beat [[City Rovers|City Rovers Reserves]] 21 to 9. Richmond also recorded two wins over the touring [[West Tigers|Western Suburbs]] side who had won the New South Wales premiership with 18-16 and 10-3 point wins. This was arguably the strongest set of results of any club at the senior level in Auckland Rugby League's history to this point.\n\nThe Roope Rooster competition saw the debut of the [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] and [[Papakura Sea Eagles|Papakura]] senior teams playing in a senior A grade competition with both sides playing on [[Carlaw Park]] # 2 field. Both teams performed meritoriously before Mt Albert went down to Ponsonby 19 to 11, and Papakura lost to Marist 6 points to 3.\n\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team had a successful season recording wins over [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] by 35 to 8, [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]] 19 to 12, and South Auckland by 36 to 16. The season also saw the first ever match for an official Auckland M\u0101ori team which played under the name Tamaki. They hosted [[Waikato rugby league team|Lower Waikato]] in a Waitangi Maori Shield match which they won 36 to 13.\n\n==Auckland Rugby League Meetings==\nAt the annual meeting of the junior management committee on March 20 the report they received showed that the number of players and clubs had increased by over 11 percent and 14 percent respectively.

The gate takings were over \u00a3400 being available as grants to senior clubs in 1933. The working gate takings were \u00a31,953 12/9 from club matches (an increase of \u00a3158). Ground rents of \u00a3154 7/ were lower but profits of \u00a3196 18/ were recorded from matches with visiting provincial teams. Registered player fees accounted for \u00a399 12/ and this combined with donations and the earlier stated income meant total receipts of \u00a32,636 2/5. Expenditure was \u00a3487 17/6 on ground rents, \u00a3340 17/2 on maintenance and upkeep of the park and grounds, \u00a3175 on staffing grounds and cost to officials, and minor expenses.

L. Macey stated that there was \u201cno ban on the broadcasting of Rugby League football in Auckland\u201d, however the station 1ZB was going to be unable to broadcast matches.

Rugby Union was going to be broadcast out of the Broadcasting Boards own funds, and soccer was going to be broadcast through 1YA.

At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipino]]s and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesian]] puppet government.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996</ref> Terauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement.<ref>When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref>\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\" (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that \"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one.\" <ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009</ref>\n\nWhen told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi.

Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\" (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that \"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one.\"<ref>http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Peattie_et_al_2011</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last = Dupuy | first =  Trevor N. | coauthors = | year = 1992 | title = [[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]| publisher = HarperCollins Publishers Inc | location = New York | isbn = 0-7858-0437-4}}\n*{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Richard | coauthors =  | year = 1992 | title = Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai | publisher = Arms and Armor | location = London | isbn = 1-85409-151-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/shokanhirohitoss00full }}\n*{{cite book | last = Hayashi | first = Saburo | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1959 | chapter =| title = Kogun: The Japanese Army in the Pacific War | publisher = Marine Corps.

At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan. However, her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], vetoed the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/01/24/national/queen-nixed-mums-surrender-sword-slight-book/| title=Queen nixed mum\u2019s surrender sword slight: book| work=The Japan Times| date=24 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hisaichi Terauchi memorial, Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore - 20070526.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to Terauchi in the [[Japanese Cemetery Park]], Singapore]]\n\n==War Crimes==\nTerauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on the [[Filipino]]s and of Imamura for granting too much power to the [[Indonesian]] puppet government. Terauchi's attitude likely played a role in [[Masaharu Homma]]'s subsequent relief and retirement.\n\nWhen told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke from which he perished early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for [[war crime]]s, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.\n\nTerauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\" (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that \"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last = Dupuy | first =  Trevor N. | coauthors = | year = 1992 | title = [[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]| publisher = HarperCollins Publishers Inc | location = New York | isbn = 0-7858-0437-4}}\n*{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Richard | coauthors =  | year = 1992 | title = Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai | publisher = Arms and Armor | location = London | isbn = 1-85409-151-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/shokanhirohitoss00full }}\n*{{cite book | last = Hayashi | first = Saburo | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1959 | chapter =| title = Kogun: The Japanese Army in the Pacific War | publisher = Marine Corps.
