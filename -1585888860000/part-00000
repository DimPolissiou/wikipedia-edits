The term was coined in an October 1940 [[science fiction fanzine]] by [[Russ Chauvenet]] and first popularized within [[science fiction fandom]], and from there it was adopted by other communities.\n\nTypically, publishers, editors, writers and other contributors of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] or [[illustration]]s to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment (LoCs), which are then published.\n\nSome fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications (sometimes known as \"prozines\"), and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with \"[[fan magazine]]\", but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications ''for'' (rather than ''by'') fans.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origins of amateur [[fanac]] \"fan\" publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed [[amateur press association]]s to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry and commentary, such as [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s ''United Amateur''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Myawoc_PbF4C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=hp+lovecraft+united+amateur+amateur+press+association#v=onepage&q=hp%20lovecraft%20united%20amateur%20amateur%20press%20association&f=false |title=An H.P.

Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the [[spirit duplicator]] or even the [[hectograph]]). Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of [[mimeograph machine]]s enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of [[desktop publishing]] and [[self-publishing|self-publication]], there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.\n\n==Genres==\n\n===Science fiction===\n{{Main|Science fiction fanzines}}\n{{Category see also|Science fiction fanzines}}\n\nWhen [[Hugo Gernsback]] published the first [[science fiction magazine]], ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious & Constructive (later shortened to [[sercon]]) correspondence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Fans finding themselves writing the same letter to several correspondents sought to save themselves a lot of typing by duplicating their letters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEarly efforts included simple [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] but that proved insufficient.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The first science fiction fanzine, ''[[The Comet]]'', was published in 1930 by the [[Science Correspondence Club]] in Chicago and edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]] and [[Walter Dennis]].<ref name=\"moskowitz\">{{cite book | first1 = Sam | last1 = Moskowitz | authorlink1 = Sam Moskowitz |first2=Joe |last2= Sanders|authorlink2=Joe Sanders | title = The Origins of Science Fiction Fandom: A Reconstruction | booktitle = Science Fiction Fandom | pages = 17\u201336 | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1994 | location = Westport, CT }}</ref> The term \"fanzine\" was coined by [[Russ Chauvenet]] in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine ''Detours''. \"Fanzines\" were distinguished from \"prozines,\" (a term Chauvenet also invented): that is, all professional magazines. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as \"fanmags\" or \"letterzines\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nScience fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[hectograph]], introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an [[aniline]] dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically [[indigo]]). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the [[spirit duplicator]], essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by [[Ditto Corporation]] in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.\n\nThe [[mimeograph]] machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with more than a little effort) print in color. The [[electronic stencil cutter]] (shortened to \"electrostencil\" by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo'd zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the internet made correspondence cheaper and ''much'' faster, and the [[World Wide Web]] has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.\n\nThe printing technology affected the style of writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to \"[[leet]]-speak\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  (A well-known example is the \"initials\" used by [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in his fanzines from the 30s, and 40s, namely \"4sj\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Fans around the world knew Ackerman by three letters \"4sj\" or even two: \"4e\" for \"Forry.\")  [[Fanspeak]] is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Philip|title=Language of Science Fiction Fandom|journal=Word Ways|year=1975|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5\u20136}}</ref> When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.\n\nNever commercial enterprises, most [[science fiction fanzine]]s were (and many still are) available for \"the usual,\" meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a \"letter of comment\" (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet [[newsgroup]]s and [[mailing list]]s today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors (\"faneds\") would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one another's [[LiveJournal#The word .22friend.22|friends list]]. Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today. Blogs \u2013 with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content\u2014follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without (usually) realizing the antecedent.\n\nSince 1937, science fiction fans have formed [[amateur press association]]s (APAs); the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called [[apazine]]s and often containing [[mailing comment]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Southard|first1=Bruce|title=The Language of Science-Fiction Fan Magazines|journal=American Speech|date=Spring 1982|volume=57|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/455177|jstor=i219220}}</ref> Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual \"e-zines,\" distributed on the Internet.<ref name=\"That's Not Online\">{{cite web|title=Amateur Press Associations (APAs) (UPDATED)|url=http://thatsnotonline.tumblr.com/post/4313215829/amateur-press-associations-apas-updated|website=That's Not Online|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> Specific [[Hugo Award]]s are given for [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|fanzines]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|fan writing]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|fanart]].\n\n==== Media  ====\nMedia fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan publication called ''[[Spockanalia]]'', published in September 1967<ref name=\"verba2003\">{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan & Zine History, 1967\u20131987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=6 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=10 September 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>{{rp|1}}<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/21winston.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Joan Winston, 'Trek' Superfan, Dies at 77 | first=William | last=Grimes | date=21 September 2008 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> by members of the [[Lunacon|Lunarians]].<ref name=\"cbs2000\">{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112\u2013113 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&lpg=PA112&pg=PA112#v=onepage&f=false | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}</ref> They hoped that fanzines such as ''Spockanalia'' would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|6}} All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from [[D. C. Fontana]], [[Gene Roddenberry]], and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|1,2,83}}\n\nMany other Star Trek 'zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[Blake's 7]]''. By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that [[adzines]] existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although ''Spockanalia'' had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from [[digest-sized]] mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.\n\nMen wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that \"One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bacon-Smith|first=Camille|title=Science fiction culture|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13333.html}}</ref> Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included [[fan fiction]]. By doing so, they \"fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.\"{{r|cbs2000}} In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or film's principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.\n\nIn the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source (first [[Kirk/Spock]], then later Starsky/Hutch, Napoleon/Illya, and many others) started to appear in zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This became known as [[Slash fiction|slash]] from the '/' mark used in adzines to differentiate a K&S story (which would have been a Kirk and Spock friendship story) from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Slash zines eventually became their own sub-subgenre; in many [[fandoms]] you rarely saw slash and non-slash stories appear in the same zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published;<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddreamspress.com/database.htm|title=Database over Kirk/Spock Zines published \u2013 CyberDreams|work=beyonddreamspress.com}}</ref> over 500 of them were k/s zines.<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\"/>\n\nAnother popular franchise for fanzines was the \"[[Star Wars]]\" saga. By the time the film \"[[The Empire Strikes Back]]\" was released in 1980 Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.okbuy.eu/info-fanzine/#.Xoa84ogzaUk|title=Fanzine|last=Hill|first=Jemele|date=October 16, 2017|website=okbuy|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director [[George Lucas]] threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Comics ===\nComics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]] of [[science fiction fandom]]. Famously, the first version of [[Superman]] (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s 1933 fanzine ''Science Fiction''. In 1936, [[David Kyle]] published '' The Fantasy World '', possibly the first comics fanzine.<ref>Kyle, David. [http://jophan.org/mimosa/m24/kyle.htm \"Phamous Phantasy Phan\"]. [[Mimosa (magazine)|''Mimosa'']] no. 24, pp. 25\u201328.</ref><ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/> Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started ''[[The Comic Collector's News]]'' in October 1947.<ref>{{Google books|QMnxCwAAQBAJ|Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|page=286|keywords=The+Comic+Collector's+News|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> By 1952, [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about [[Superman]], and [[James Taurasi]] issued the short-lived ''Fantasy Comics''. In 1953, [[Bhob Stewart]] published ''The EC Fan Bulletin'',<ref name=\"powerofcomics\">{{Google books|PA175|The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture|page=175|keywords=EC+Fan+Bulletin|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> which launched [[EC Comics|EC]] fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White and [[Larry Stark]] produced ''Potrzebie'', planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was [[Ron Parker (writer)|Ron Parker]]'s ''Hoo-Hah!''. After that came fanzines by the followers of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'' and ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]''. Publishers of these included future [[underground comics]] stars like [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Robert Crumb]].\n\nIn 1960, [[Richard A. Lupoff|Richard and Pat Lupoff]] launched their [[science fiction fandom|science fiction]] and comics fanzine ''[[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]]''. In the second issue, \"The Spawn of M.C. Gaines'\" by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff, [[Don Thompson (Comics Buyer's Guide)|Don Thompson]], [[Bill Blackbeard]], [[Jim Harmon]] and others under the heading, ''All in Color for a Dime.'' In 1961, [[Jerry Bails]]' ''[[Alter Ego (fanzine)|Alter Ego]]'', devoted to [[superhero|costumed heroes]],<ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/> f became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.\n\nContacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern [[comics fandom]]: conventions, collecting, etc. Much of this, like comics fandom itself, began as part of standard [[science fiction convention]]s, but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (''[[The Comic Reader]]'' was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. During the 1970s, many fanzines (''[[Squa Tront]]'', as example) also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.\n\nAt times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via 'prozines', in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers. ''[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]'' and the Marvel magazine ''[[FOOM]]'' began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period (''AWODCC'' was $1.50, ''FOOM'' was 75 cents), each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching children's comics of the 1970s, and 1980s (e.g. ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Pony School'', etc.). These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or [[irony|ironic]] twist.\n\n===Horror film ===\n[[File:Horrors of the Screen 3 fanzine cover 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Horrors of the Screen No. 3, 1964]]\nAs with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications.  ''Trumpet,'' edited by [[Tom Reamy]], was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage.

Stover's ''Black Oracle'' partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine ''The Late Show'' (1974\u20131976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the ''Cinefantastique'' prozine spinoff ''[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]].'' In the mid-1970s, [[North Carolina]] teenager [[Sam Irvin]] published the horror/science-fiction fanzine ''Bizarre'' which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=33692&first=&last=&title=&did=1&referer=%2Fproduction%2Ffaculty.cfm&startpage=1&startrow=31|title=School of Cinematic Arts Directory Profile \u2013 USC School of Cinematic Arts|work=usc.edu}}</ref> ''Japanese Fantasy Film Journal'' (JFFJ) (1968\u20131983) from the late Greg Shoemaker (1947\u20132019) covered [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' and his Asian brethren when no other publications much cared.

[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] and [[Greg Shaw]] were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, ''Mojo Navigator'' (full title, \"''Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News''\") (1966) and ''[[Who Put the Bomp]]'', (1970), are among the most important early rock fanzines.\n\n''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music \"prozines,\" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. ''Bomp'' remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including [[Lester Bangs]], [[Greil Marcus]], Ken Barnes, [[Ed Ward (writer)|Ed Ward]], [[Dave Marsh]], [[Mike Saunders]] and [[Richard Meltzer|R. Meltzer]].  ''Bomp'' featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. ''Bomp'' was not alone; an August 1970 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include ''[[denim delinquent]]'' 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, ''Flash,'' 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, ''Eurock Magazine'' (1973\u20131993) edited by Archie Patterson and ''Bam Balam,'' written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, ''[[Back Door Man (fanzine)|Back Door Man]]''.\n\nIn the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' ''[[Ugly Things]]'', Billy Miller and [[Miriam Linna]]'s ''Kicks'', Jake Austen's ''[[Roctober (fanzine)|Roctober]]'', Kim Cooper's ''[[Scram (fanzine)|Scram]]'', P. Edwin Letcher's ''[[Garage & Beat]]'', and the UK's [[Shindig! (magazine)|Shindig!]] and Italy's ''[[Misty Lane]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s megastardom following the ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' album and [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond's ''Candy's Room'', coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's ''Point Blank'', Dave Percival's ''The Fever'', Jeff Matthews' ''Rendezvous'', and Paul Limbrick's ''Jackson Cage''. In the US, ''[[Backstreets Magazine]]'' started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website. In the late 1990s, notorious fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and [[post-rock]] music. ''Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e'' fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.\n\n===Punk ===\n{{Main|Punk zine}}\n{{Category see also|Punk zines}}\n[[File:1970s fanzines (21224199545).jpg|thumb|British punk fanzines from the 1970s.]]\n\n====UK ====\n\nThe [[punk subculture]] in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', produced by [[Deptford, London|Deptford]] punk fan [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]].  ''Sniffin' Glue'' ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of [[The Ramones]] on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included ''[[Blam! (fanzine)|Blam!]]'', ''[[Bombsite (fanzine)|Bombsite]]'', Wool City Rocker, ''Burnt Offering'', ''[[Chainsaw (punk zine)|Chainsaw]]'', ''[[New Crimes]]'', ''[[Vague (fanzine)|Vague]]'', ''[[Jamming (fanzine)|Jamming]]'', [[Artcore Fanzine]], ''[[Love and Molotov Cocktails]]'', ''[[To Hell With Poverty]]'', ''[[New Youth (fanzine)|New Youth]]'', ''[[Peroxide (punk zine)|Peroxide]]'', ''[[ENZK]]'', ''[[Juniper beri-beri]]'', ''[[No Cure]]'',''[[Communication Blur]]'', ''[[Rox (fanzine)|Rox]]'', ''[[Grim Humour]]'', ''[[Spuno]]''<ref name=\"Spuno info online\">{{cite web|url=http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2011/07/spuno-3-1980.html|title=essential ephemera|author=Si|work=si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n, ''[[Cool Notes]]'' and ''[[Fumes (magazine)|Fumes]]''. Of these, Tony Fletcher's ''Jamming'' was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n====US ====\nIn the US, ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' and ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and [[Clinton Walker]] fused their respective punk zines ''Plastered Press'' and ''Suicide Alley'' to launch ''Pulp''; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with ''Fast Forward'', in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messandnoise.com/features/4331535|title=Fast Forward: A Pre-Internet Story|date=18 September 2011|website=messandnoise.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonwalker.com.au/fanzines-1970s.html|title=Fanzines (1970s)|website=Clinton Walker|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Starting earlier, in 1976, ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' was published in New York and played a major part in popularizing [[Punk rock#Etymology|punk rock]] (a term coined a few years earlier in ''[[Creem]]'') as the term for the music and the bands being written about.\n\nAmong later titles, ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as ''[[Punk Planet]]'', ''[[Razorcake]]'', ''[[Tail Spins]]'', ''[[Sobriquet (magazine)|Sobriquet]]'', ''[[Profane Existence]]'' and ''[[Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)|Slug and Lettuce]]''. The early American punkzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'' eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine ''[[Re/Search]]''.\n\nSome punk fanzines from the 80s, like No Class fanzine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noclass.co.uk|title=No Class Fanzine, No Class Records, No Class Now, No Class Gigs|work=noclass.co.uk}}</ref> and Ugly American<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyamericanzine.com|title=The Official Ugly American Zine Archives, 1988\u20131999.|work=uglyamericanzine.com}}</ref> are experiencing a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. For the past 6 years, Suburban Rebels in Northern California has been leading the Punk zine way.\n\nMany of the punk zines were printed in small quantities and promoted the local scene. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.\n\n====After the year 2000====\n\nIn the UK ''[[Fracture (fanzine)|Fracture]]'' and ''[[Reason To Believe (fanzine)|Reason To Believe]]'' were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003. ''[[Rancid News]]'' filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue ''Rancid News'' changed its name to ''[[Last Hours]]'' with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. ''Last Hours'' still operates as a [[webzine]] though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. ''[[Artcore Fanzine]]'' (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30-year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.\n\n=====Mark Wilkins and Mystic records=====\n\nMark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label [[Mystic Records]], had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited ''The Mystic News Newsletter'' which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine ''Wild Times'' and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.\n\n====Italy====\nIn [[Perugia]], Italy, ''Mazquerade'' ran from 1979 to 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perugiamusica.com/RIVISTE/MAZQUERADE/mazquerade.html|title=Perugiamusica.com|website=perugiamusica.com|accessdate=14 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303123957/http://www.perugiamusica.com/RIVISTE/MAZQUERADE/mazquerade.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Basilicata]], Italy, ''Raw Art Fanzine'' ran from 1995 to 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.it/news/raw-art-fanzine-restauro-digitale-e-disponibilita-dei-numeri-degli-anni-90-89535|title=Raw Art Fanzine: restauro digitale e disponibilit\u00e0 dei numeri degli anni '90|website=truemetal.it|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Milano]], Italy, ''Gorezilla'' ran from 1988 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moviemags.com/main_g.php?title=GOREZILLA&year=%}}</ref>\n\n===Mod===\nIn the United Kingdom, the 1979 [[Mod revival]], which was inspired by the 1960s [[Mod subculture]], brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth [[subculture]] inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was ''Maximum Speed'', which successfully captured the frenetic world of a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] revival scene that was propelling bands like [[Secret Affair]], [[Purple Hearts (British band)|Purple Hearts]] and [[The Chords]] into the UK charts.\n\nAfter the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were ''Extraordinary Sensations'', produced by future radio DJ [[Eddie Piller]], and ''Shadows & Reflections'', published by future national magazine editor [[Chris Hunt]]. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983\u201386) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.\n\n===Local music===\nIn the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and [[Letraset]]. Examples include ''[[Bombsite Fanzine]]'' (Liverpool 1977), Wool City Rocker (Bradford 1979 \u2013 1982), ''[[City Fun]]'' (Manchester), 1984, Spuno (Bath 1980)<ref name=\"Spuno info online\"/> ''[[No Cure]]'' (Berkshire) and ''[[Town Hall Steps (fanzine)|Town Hall Steps]]'' (Bolton) and more recently [[''mono'' (fanzine)]], (Bradford) with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette (Sheffield 1987) and Crime Pays (Liverpool 1988).\n\n===Role-playing-game fanzines===\nAnother sizable group of fanzines arose in [[role-playing game]] (RPG) fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their [[role-playing campaigns]]. In 1975, was released the apazine [[Alarums and Excursions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 October 2006|title=RPG Magzine and zine Index- Alarms & Excursions Page|date=24 October 2006|accessdate=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nRole-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.\n\nA fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG zinedom got their start in, or remain part of, [[science fiction fandom]]. This is also true of the small but still active [[board game]] fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around [[play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]] [[Diplomacy game|Diplomacy]].\n\nThe UK fanzine [[Aslan (fanzine)|Aslan]] (1988\u20131991)<ref>{{Google books|ix9WDwAAQBAJ|Role-Playing Game Studies: Transmedia Foundations|keywords=aslan+fanzine|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> was responsible for popularization of [[freeform role-playing game]]s in the UK.<ref name=nnbtv>{{cite web |url=http://nnbtv.org.uk/Games/History.html|title=Me and Freeforms|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Video gaming ===\nVideo game fanzines first emerged during the [[Second generation of video game consoles|second generation period]] when newsletters for computer user groups and stores were not uncommon, though not always well-known. Subscriber-based newsletters included the well-known ''[[8: 16 (UK, all things Atari, 1st issue Nov 1987)]]'',''[[The Video Game Update]]'' and later ''[[Computer Entertainer]]''. The publication, ''[[Joystick Jolter]]'' was the first actual fanzine.\n\nLater, as desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming (e.g. ''[[2600 Connection]]'' and ''[[Classic Systems & Games Monthly]]''), or current gaming (e.g. ''[[APE (fanzine)|APE]]'' and ''[[The Subversive Sprite]]''). However some fanzines covered both topics (e.g. ''[[Digital Press]]'' and ''[[Joystick & Screen]]''). The number of zines grew bigger when video game journalists including [[Arnie Katz]] and [[Chris Bieniek]] used their columns to publish reviews of fanzines that they had been sent at magazines like ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'', ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'', and ''[[Tips & Tricks]]''. These reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and creating a fanzine scene.\n\nThe video game fanzine diminished greatly in popularity with the rise of the web, though some zines\u2014particularly the classic gaming ones\u2014continued past the mid-90s (e.g. ''[[Classic Gamer Magazine]]'' and ''[[Video Game Collector]]''). The rise of \"on demand\" publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like ''[[Jumpbutton]]'' and ''[[Scroll]]''.\n\nThe video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but there were/are zines from other countries too. Video game fanzines in UK have included ''[[Retrogamer]]'', ''[[Pixel Nation]]'', ''[[Capcom Fanzine]]'', ''[[Mercury (fanzine)|Mercury]]'', and ''[[Super Famicom Mini Mag]]'' among others.<ref>Bielby, Matt, ed. \"Super Express \u2013 Fanhunter: Super Play's Fanzine Round-Up.\" ''[[Super Play]]''.

July 1993. {{ISSN|0966-6192}}.</ref> In France fanzines like ''[[Revival (fanzine)|Revival]]'' we circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish [[doujin]] works.\n\nMore recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of HyperPlay RPG in 2015 and Switch Player in 2017. Based in part on the above-mentioned Super Play with a focus on role-playing games and \"any-bit\" Nintendo,<ref>hyperplayrpg.com</ref> popular fanzine HyperPlay RPG has been consistently well-reviewed by the mainstream video game media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/09/hyperplay_rpg_is_a_glorious_throwback_to_the_pre-internet_days_of_homemade_fanzines|title=HyperPlay RPG Is A Glorious Throwback to the Pre-Internet Days Of Homemade Fanzines|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=27 September 2015|website=nintendolife.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Wargaming===\nSeveral fanzines exist within the hobby of [[wargaming]]. Among them is ''[[CHARGE! (magazine)|Charge!]]'', a leading international fanzine exclusively for [[miniature wargaming]] enthusiasts for the [[American Civil War]] period. Other fanzines support [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer]] and other popular rules sets.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Category see also|Football fanzines}}\nThe first association football fanzine is regarded as being [[Foul (fanzine)|Foul]], a publication that ran between 1972 and 1976.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet 7: Fan 'Power' and Democracy in Football |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |work=Department of Sociology: Sports Resources |publisher=University of Leicester |access-date=25 August 2010 |author=Gavin Barber (updated by John Williams) |year=2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184842/http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |archive-date=21 August 2010 |df= }}</ref> In the UK, most [[Premier League]] or [[The Football League|Football League]] [[association football|football]] clubs have one or more fanzines which supplement, oppose and complement the club's official magazine or matchday programme. A reasonably priced 'zine has a guaranteed audience, as is the culture of passion in being a football fan.\n\nThe longest running fanzine is ''[[The City Gent (fanzine)|The City Gent]]'', produced by supporters of [[Bradford City FC]], which first went on sale at Valley Parade in November 1984 and is now in its 26th season. Following close on its heels was Nike, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a-love-supreme.com|title=A Love Supreme \u2013 The Independent Sunderland Football Club Fanzine|author=Azure Graphic & Web Design|work=a-love-supreme.com}}</ref> which was first released in 1989. At the time it was not the first of its kind with ''Terrace Talk'' (York City), which was first published in November 1981 and ''Wanderers Worldwide'' (Bolton Wanderers) having already been established but since disappeared. In 1985 the emergent ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'' (a fanzine without a specific club focus that was subsequently launched as a mainstream magazine) promoted a 'fanzine movement' that gave birth to many more club titles during the late 1980s which was something of a glory period for fanzines.\n\nWith the widespread availability of the Internet, much of the energy that was put into football fanzines subsequently went into the development of supporters' websites. Examples of other UK football fanzines include ''[[A Love Supreme (fanzine)|A Love Supreme]]'' ([[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]]), ''[[TOOFIF]]'' ([[Fulham FC|Fulham]]), ''[[The Square Ball]]'' ([[Leeds United]]), ''4,000 Holes'' ([[Blackburn Rovers]]) and ''[[War of the Monster Trucks]]'' (a [[Sheffield Wednesday]] fanzine named after a local TV station elected not to show the final scenes of an unlikely cup victory). The Queen's Park Rangers fanzine 'A Kick up the Rs' was first published in August 1987 and is still issuing an average of 10 issues per season.\n\nFanzines are not exclusive to the top tiers of football however, with [[Northern Counties East League]] side [[Scarborough Athletic FC]] having a fanzine titled ''[[Abandon Chip!]]'', a pun based on both the perilous situation of predecessor club [[Scarborough FC]] and that club's sponsors, [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]].\n\nAnd also away from the world of Football there were a number of established fanzines, for example [[Rugby league]] has such notable publications as ''[[Who The Hell Was St. George Anyway?]]'' Rugby League fanzine, by supporters of Doncaster RLFC and ''Scarlet Turkey'' of [[Salford Red Devils|Salford City Reds]].However, due to pressure from the Internet etc. these publications no longer exist in printed form. The title of World's longest running Rugby League fanzine now belongs to ''[[The Aye of the Tigers]]'', by Castleford Tigers supporters. The fanzine movement has even spread to the United States, where ice hockey fans have produced several popular fanzines. In Chicago two examples include the formerly published ''Blue Line Magazine'' and currently ''The Committed Indian'', both produced by [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2009/05/27/The-Committed-Indian-Snark-and-in-depth-report-informs-and-entertains-27581.html | title=The Committed Indian; Snark and in-depth report informs and entertains | work=[[Chi-Town Daily News]] | date=27 May 2009 | access-date=18 October 2018 | author=Grant, Lou | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703231147/http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2009/05/27/The-Committed-Indian-Snark-and-in-depth-report-informs-and-entertains-27581.html | archive-date=3 July 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In [[St. Louis]] there are ''Game Night Revue'' and ''St Louis Game Time'' for the [[St. Louis Blues]].\n\nThere are also a number of fanzines to be found in Ireland of which [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]]'s ''Red Inc.'' is the longest running.\n\nIn the United States, sports fanzines are relatively rare. In [[Boston]] they are a bit more common. There are two fanzines sold outside Fenway Park including ''Yawkey Way Report'', which is run by a former Marine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yawkeywayreport.com/meet-the-staff/ceo-sly-egidio/|title=CEO Sly Egidio \u2013 Yawkey Way Report|newspaper=Yawkey Way Report|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/10/fenway-scene-war-among-rival-hawkers-game-programs/eTsR16JIvyshTp3S7tLhEJ/story.html|title=Fenway program hawkers' rivalry fuels competition|newspaper=Boston Globe|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nWith the increasing availability of the Internet in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the traditional paper zine has begun to give way to the [[webzine]] (or \"e-zine\") that is easier to produce and uses the potential of the Internet to reach an ever-larger, possibly global, audience. Nonetheless, printed fanzines are still produced, either out of preference for the format or to reach people who do not have convenient Web access. Online versions of approximately 200 [[science fiction fanzine]]s will be found at Bill Burns'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eFanzines.com|title=eFanzines.com|website=efanzines.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> eFanzines web site, along with links to other [[science fiction fanzine|SF fanzine]] sites.

The term was coined in an October 1940 [[science fiction fanzine]] by [[Russ Chauvenet]] and first popularized within [[science fiction fandom]], and from there it was adopted by other communities.\n\nTypically, publishers, editors, writers and other contributors of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] or [[illustration]]s to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment (LoCs), which are then published.\n\nSome fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications (sometimes known as \"prozines\"), and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with \"[[fan magazine]]\", but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications ''for'' (rather than ''by'') fans.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origins of amateur [[fanac]] \"fan\" publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed [[amateur press association]]s to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry and commentary, such as [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s ''United Amateur''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Myawoc_PbF4C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=hp+lovecraft+united+amateur+amateur+press+association#v=onepage&q=hp%20lovecraft%20united%20amateur%20amateur%20press%20association&f=false |title=An H.P.

Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the [[spirit duplicator]] or even the [[hectograph]]). Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of [[mimeograph machine]]s enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of [[desktop publishing]] and [[self-publishing|self-publication]], there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.\n\n==Genres==\n\n===Science fiction===\n{{Main|Science fiction fanzines}}\n{{Category see also|Science fiction fanzines}}\n\nWhen [[Hugo Gernsback]] published the first [[science fiction magazine]], ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious & Constructive (later shortened to [[sercon]]) correspondence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Fans finding themselves writing the same letter to several correspondents sought to save themselves a lot of typing by duplicating their letters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEarly efforts included simple [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] but that proved insufficient.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The first science fiction fanzine, ''[[The Comet]]'', was published in 1930 by the [[Science Correspondence Club]] in Chicago and edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]] and [[Walter Dennis]].<ref name=\"moskowitz\">{{cite book | first1 = Sam | last1 = Moskowitz | authorlink1 = Sam Moskowitz |first2=Joe |last2= Sanders|authorlink2=Joe Sanders | title = The Origins of Science Fiction Fandom: A Reconstruction | booktitle = Science Fiction Fandom | pages = 17\u201336 | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1994 | location = Westport, CT }}</ref> The term \"fanzine\" was coined by [[Russ Chauvenet]] in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine ''Detours''. \"Fanzines\" were distinguished from \"prozines,\" (a term Chauvenet also invented): that is, all professional magazines. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as \"fanmags\" or \"letterzines\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nScience fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[hectograph]], introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an [[aniline]] dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically [[indigo]]). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the [[spirit duplicator]], essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by [[Ditto Corporation]] in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.\n\nThe [[mimeograph]] machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with more than a little effort) print in color. The [[electronic stencil cutter]] (shortened to \"electrostencil\" by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo'd zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the internet made correspondence cheaper and ''much'' faster, and the [[World Wide Web]] has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.\n\nThe printing technology affected the style of writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to \"[[leet]]-speak\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  (A well-known example is the \"initials\" used by [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in his fanzines from the 30s, and 40s, namely \"4sj\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Fans around the world knew Ackerman by three letters \"4sj\" or even two: \"4e\" for \"Forry.\")  [[Fanspeak]] is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Philip|title=Language of Science Fiction Fandom|journal=Word Ways|year=1975|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5\u20136}}</ref> When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.\n\nNever commercial enterprises, most [[science fiction fanzine]]s were (and many still are) available for \"the usual,\" meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a \"letter of comment\" (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet [[newsgroup]]s and [[mailing list]]s today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors (\"faneds\") would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one another's [[LiveJournal#The word .22friend.22|friends list]]. Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today. Blogs \u2013 with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content\u2014follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without (usually) realizing the antecedent.\n\nSince 1937, science fiction fans have formed [[amateur press association]]s (APAs); the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called [[apazine]]s and often containing [[mailing comment]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Southard|first1=Bruce|title=The Language of Science-Fiction Fan Magazines|journal=American Speech|date=Spring 1982|volume=57|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/455177|jstor=i219220}}</ref> Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual \"e-zines,\" distributed on the Internet.<ref name=\"That's Not Online\">{{cite web|title=Amateur Press Associations (APAs) (UPDATED)|url=http://thatsnotonline.tumblr.com/post/4313215829/amateur-press-associations-apas-updated|website=That's Not Online|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> Specific [[Hugo Award]]s are given for [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|fanzines]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|fan writing]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|fanart]].\n\n==== Media  ====\nMedia fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan publication called ''[[Spockanalia]]'', published in September 1967<ref name=\"verba2003\">{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan & Zine History, 1967\u20131987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=6 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=10 September 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>{{rp|1}}<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/21winston.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Joan Winston, 'Trek' Superfan, Dies at 77 | first=William | last=Grimes | date=21 September 2008 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> by members of the [[Lunacon|Lunarians]].<ref name=\"cbs2000\">{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112\u2013113 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&lpg=PA112&pg=PA112#v=onepage&f=false | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}</ref> They hoped that fanzines such as ''Spockanalia'' would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|6}} All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from [[D. C. Fontana]], [[Gene Roddenberry]], and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].{{r|verba2003}}{{rp|1,2,83}}\n\nMany other Star Trek 'zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[Blake's 7]]''. By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that [[adzines]] existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although ''Spockanalia'' had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from [[digest-sized]] mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.\n\nMen wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that \"One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bacon-Smith|first=Camille|title=Science fiction culture|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13333.html}}</ref> Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included [[fan fiction]]. By doing so, they \"fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.\"{{r|cbs2000}} In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or film's principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.\n\nIn the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source (first [[Kirk/Spock]], then later Starsky/Hutch, Napoleon/Illya, and many others) started to appear in zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This became known as [[Slash fiction|slash]] from the '/' mark used in adzines to differentiate a K&S story (which would have been a Kirk and Spock friendship story) from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Slash zines eventually became their own sub-subgenre; in many [[fandoms]] you rarely saw slash and non-slash stories appear in the same zines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published;<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddreamspress.com/database.htm|title=Database over Kirk/Spock Zines published \u2013 CyberDreams|work=beyonddreamspress.com}}</ref> over 500 of them were k/s zines.<ref name=\"beyonddreamspress.com\"/>\n\nAnother popular franchise for fanzines was the \"[[Star Wars]]\" saga. By the time the film \"[[The Empire Strikes Back]]\" was released in 1980 Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director [[George Lucas]] threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Comics ===\nComics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]] of [[science fiction fandom]]. Famously, the first version of [[Superman]] (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s 1933 fanzine ''Science Fiction''. In 1936, [[David Kyle]] published '' The Fantasy World '', possibly the first comics fanzine.<ref>Kyle, David. [http://jophan.org/mimosa/m24/kyle.htm \"Phamous Phantasy Phan\"]. [[Mimosa (magazine)|''Mimosa'']] no. 24, pp. 25\u201328.</ref><ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/> Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started ''[[The Comic Collector's News]]'' in October 1947.<ref>{{Google books|QMnxCwAAQBAJ|Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|page=286|keywords=The+Comic+Collector's+News|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> By 1952, [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]] had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about [[Superman]], and [[James Taurasi]] issued the short-lived ''Fantasy Comics''. In 1953, [[Bhob Stewart]] published ''The EC Fan Bulletin'',<ref name=\"powerofcomics\">{{Google books|PA175|The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture|page=175|keywords=EC+Fan+Bulletin|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> which launched [[EC Comics|EC]] fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White and [[Larry Stark]] produced ''Potrzebie'', planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was [[Ron Parker (writer)|Ron Parker]]'s ''Hoo-Hah!''. After that came fanzines by the followers of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'' and ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]''. Publishers of these included future [[underground comics]] stars like [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Robert Crumb]].\n\nIn 1960, [[Richard A. Lupoff|Richard and Pat Lupoff]] launched their [[science fiction fandom|science fiction]] and comics fanzine ''[[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]]''. In the second issue, \"The Spawn of M.C. Gaines'\" by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff, [[Don Thompson (Comics Buyer's Guide)|Don Thompson]], [[Bill Blackbeard]], [[Jim Harmon]] and others under the heading, ''All in Color for a Dime.'' In 1961, [[Jerry Bails]]' ''[[Alter Ego (fanzine)|Alter Ego]]'', devoted to [[superhero|costumed heroes]],<ref name=\"powerofcomics\"/> f became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.\n\nContacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern [[comics fandom]]: conventions, collecting, etc. Much of this, like comics fandom itself, began as part of standard [[science fiction convention]]s, but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (''[[The Comic Reader]]'' was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. During the 1970s, many fanzines (''[[Squa Tront]]'', as example) also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.\n\nAt times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via 'prozines', in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers. ''[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]'' and the Marvel magazine ''[[FOOM]]'' began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period (''AWODCC'' was $1.50, ''FOOM'' was 75 cents), each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching children's comics of the 1970s, and 1980s (e.g. ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Pony School'', etc.). These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or [[irony|ironic]] twist.\n\n===Horror film ===\n[[File:Horrors of the Screen 3 fanzine cover 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Horrors of the Screen No. 3, 1964]]\nAs with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications.  ''Trumpet,'' edited by [[Tom Reamy]], was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage. Alex Soma's ''Horrors of the Screen,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/unifan2001/HotS.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027140344/http://www.geocities.com/unifan2001/HotS.html|title=Horrors of the Screen|archivedate=27 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> [[Calvin T.

Stover's ''Black Oracle'' partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine ''The Late Show'' (1974\u20131976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the ''Cinefantastique'' prozine spinoff ''[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]].'' In the mid-1970s, [[North Carolina]] teenager [[Sam Irvin]] published the horror/science-fiction fanzine ''Bizarre'' which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=33692&first=&last=&title=&did=1&referer=%2Fproduction%2Ffaculty.cfm&startpage=1&startrow=31|title=School of Cinematic Arts Directory Profile \u2013 USC School of Cinematic Arts|work=usc.edu}}</ref> ''Japanese Fantasy Film Journal'' (JFFJ) (1968\u20131983) from the late Greg Shoemaker (1947\u20132019) covered [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' and his Asian brethren when no other publications much cared.

[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] and [[Greg Shaw]] were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, ''Mojo Navigator'' (full title, \"''Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News''\") (1966) and ''[[Who Put the Bomp]]'', (1970), are among the most important early rock fanzines.\n\n''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music \"prozines,\" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. ''Bomp'' remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including [[Lester Bangs]], [[Greil Marcus]], Ken Barnes, [[Ed Ward (writer)|Ed Ward]], [[Dave Marsh]], [[Mike Saunders]] and [[Richard Meltzer|R. Meltzer]].  ''Bomp'' featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. ''Bomp'' was not alone; an August 1970 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include ''[[denim delinquent]]'' 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, ''Flash,'' 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, ''Eurock Magazine'' (1973\u20131993) edited by Archie Patterson and ''Bam Balam,'' written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, ''[[Back Door Man (fanzine)|Back Door Man]]''.\n\nIn the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' ''[[Ugly Things]]'', Billy Miller and [[Miriam Linna]]'s ''Kicks'', Jake Austen's ''[[Roctober (fanzine)|Roctober]]'', Kim Cooper's ''[[Scram (fanzine)|Scram]]'', P. Edwin Letcher's ''[[Garage & Beat]]'', and the UK's [[Shindig! (magazine)|Shindig!]] and Italy's ''[[Misty Lane]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s megastardom following the ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' album and [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond's ''Candy's Room'', coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's ''Point Blank'', Dave Percival's ''The Fever'', Jeff Matthews' ''Rendezvous'', and Paul Limbrick's ''Jackson Cage''. In the US, ''[[Backstreets Magazine]]'' started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website. In the late 1990s, notorious fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and [[post-rock]] music. ''Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e'' fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.\n\n===Punk ===\n{{Main|Punk zine}}\n{{Category see also|Punk zines}}\n[[File:1970s fanzines (21224199545).jpg|thumb|British punk fanzines from the 1970s.]]\n\n====UK ====\n\nThe [[punk subculture]] in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', produced by [[Deptford, London|Deptford]] punk fan [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]].  ''Sniffin' Glue'' ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of [[The Ramones]] on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included ''[[Blam! (fanzine)|Blam!]]'', ''[[Bombsite (fanzine)|Bombsite]]'', Wool City Rocker, ''Burnt Offering'', ''[[Chainsaw (punk zine)|Chainsaw]]'', ''[[New Crimes]]'', ''[[Vague (fanzine)|Vague]]'', ''[[Jamming (fanzine)|Jamming]]'', [[Artcore Fanzine]], ''[[Love and Molotov Cocktails]]'', ''[[To Hell With Poverty]]'', ''[[New Youth (fanzine)|New Youth]]'', ''[[Peroxide (punk zine)|Peroxide]]'', ''[[ENZK]]'', ''[[Juniper beri-beri]]'', ''[[No Cure]]'',''[[Communication Blur]]'', ''[[Rox (fanzine)|Rox]]'', ''[[Grim Humour]]'', ''[[Spuno]]''<ref name=\"Spuno info online\">{{cite web|url=http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2011/07/spuno-3-1980.html|title=essential ephemera|author=Si|work=si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n, ''[[Cool Notes]]'' and ''[[Fumes (magazine)|Fumes]]''. Of these, Tony Fletcher's ''Jamming'' was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n====US ====\nIn the US, ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' and ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and [[Clinton Walker]] fused their respective punk zines ''Plastered Press'' and ''Suicide Alley'' to launch ''Pulp''; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with ''Fast Forward'', in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messandnoise.com/features/4331535|title=Fast Forward: A Pre-Internet Story|date=18 September 2011|website=messandnoise.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonwalker.com.au/fanzines-1970s.html|title=Fanzines (1970s)|website=Clinton Walker|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Starting earlier, in 1976, ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' was published in New York and played a major part in popularizing [[Punk rock#Etymology|punk rock]] (a term coined a few years earlier in ''[[Creem]]'') as the term for the music and the bands being written about.\n\nAmong later titles, ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as ''[[Punk Planet]]'', ''[[Razorcake]]'', ''[[Tail Spins]]'', ''[[Sobriquet (magazine)|Sobriquet]]'', ''[[Profane Existence]]'' and ''[[Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)|Slug and Lettuce]]''. The early American punkzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'' eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine ''[[Re/Search]]''.\n\nSome punk fanzines from the 80s, like No Class fanzine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noclass.co.uk|title=No Class Fanzine, No Class Records, No Class Now, No Class Gigs|work=noclass.co.uk}}</ref> and Ugly American<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyamericanzine.com|title=The Official Ugly American Zine Archives, 1988\u20131999.|work=uglyamericanzine.com}}</ref> are experiencing a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. For the past 6 years, Suburban Rebels in Northern California has been leading the Punk zine way.\n\nMany of the punk zines were printed in small quantities and promoted the local scene. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.\n\n====After the year 2000====\n\nIn the UK ''[[Fracture (fanzine)|Fracture]]'' and ''[[Reason To Believe (fanzine)|Reason To Believe]]'' were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003. ''[[Rancid News]]'' filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue ''Rancid News'' changed its name to ''[[Last Hours]]'' with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. ''Last Hours'' still operates as a [[webzine]] though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. ''[[Artcore Fanzine]]'' (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30-year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.\n\n=====Mark Wilkins and Mystic records=====\n\nMark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label [[Mystic Records]], had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited ''The Mystic News Newsletter'' which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine ''Wild Times'' and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.\n\n====Italy====\nIn [[Perugia]], Italy, ''Mazquerade'' ran from 1979 to 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perugiamusica.com/RIVISTE/MAZQUERADE/mazquerade.html|title=Perugiamusica.com|website=perugiamusica.com|accessdate=14 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303123957/http://www.perugiamusica.com/RIVISTE/MAZQUERADE/mazquerade.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Basilicata]], Italy, ''Raw Art Fanzine'' ran from 1995 to 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.it/news/raw-art-fanzine-restauro-digitale-e-disponibilita-dei-numeri-degli-anni-90-89535|title=Raw Art Fanzine: restauro digitale e disponibilit\u00e0 dei numeri degli anni '90|website=truemetal.it|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Milano]], Italy, ''Gorezilla'' ran from 1988 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moviemags.com/main_g.php?title=GOREZILLA&year=%}}</ref>\n\n===Mod===\nIn the United Kingdom, the 1979 [[Mod revival]], which was inspired by the 1960s [[Mod subculture]], brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth [[subculture]] inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was ''Maximum Speed'', which successfully captured the frenetic world of a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] revival scene that was propelling bands like [[Secret Affair]], [[Purple Hearts (British band)|Purple Hearts]] and [[The Chords]] into the UK charts.\n\nAfter the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were ''Extraordinary Sensations'', produced by future radio DJ [[Eddie Piller]], and ''Shadows & Reflections'', published by future national magazine editor [[Chris Hunt]]. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983\u201386) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.\n\n===Local music===\nIn the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and [[Letraset]]. Examples include ''[[Bombsite Fanzine]]'' (Liverpool 1977), Wool City Rocker (Bradford 1979 \u2013 1982), ''[[City Fun]]'' (Manchester), 1984, Spuno (Bath 1980)<ref name=\"Spuno info online\"/> ''[[No Cure]]'' (Berkshire) and ''[[Town Hall Steps (fanzine)|Town Hall Steps]]'' (Bolton) and more recently [[''mono'' (fanzine)]], (Bradford) with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette (Sheffield 1987) and Crime Pays (Liverpool 1988).\n\n===Role-playing-game fanzines===\nAnother sizable group of fanzines arose in [[role-playing game]] (RPG) fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their [[role-playing campaigns]]. In 1975, was released the apazine [[Alarums and Excursions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 October 2006|title=RPG Magzine and zine Index- Alarms & Excursions Page|date=24 October 2006|accessdate=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nRole-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.\n\nA fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG zinedom got their start in, or remain part of, [[science fiction fandom]]. This is also true of the small but still active [[board game]] fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around [[play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]] [[Diplomacy game|Diplomacy]].\n\nThe UK fanzine [[Aslan (fanzine)|Aslan]] (1988\u20131991)<ref>{{Google books|ix9WDwAAQBAJ|Role-Playing Game Studies: Transmedia Foundations|keywords=aslan+fanzine|text=|plainurl=}}</ref> was responsible for popularization of [[freeform role-playing game]]s in the UK.<ref name=nnbtv>{{cite web |url=http://nnbtv.org.uk/Games/History.html|title=Me and Freeforms|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Video gaming ===\nVideo game fanzines first emerged during the [[Second generation of video game consoles|second generation period]] when newsletters for computer user groups and stores were not uncommon, though not always well-known. Subscriber-based newsletters included the well-known ''[[8: 16 (UK, all things Atari, 1st issue Nov 1987)]]'',''[[The Video Game Update]]'' and later ''[[Computer Entertainer]]''. The publication, ''[[Joystick Jolter]]'' was the first actual fanzine.\n\nLater, as desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming (e.g. ''[[2600 Connection]]'' and ''[[Classic Systems & Games Monthly]]''), or current gaming (e.g. ''[[APE (fanzine)|APE]]'' and ''[[The Subversive Sprite]]''). However some fanzines covered both topics (e.g. ''[[Digital Press]]'' and ''[[Joystick & Screen]]''). The number of zines grew bigger when video game journalists including [[Arnie Katz]] and [[Chris Bieniek]] used their columns to publish reviews of fanzines that they had been sent at magazines like ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'', ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'', and ''[[Tips & Tricks]]''. These reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and creating a fanzine scene.\n\nThe video game fanzine diminished greatly in popularity with the rise of the web, though some zines\u2014particularly the classic gaming ones\u2014continued past the mid-90s (e.g. ''[[Classic Gamer Magazine]]'' and ''[[Video Game Collector]]''). The rise of \"on demand\" publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like ''[[Jumpbutton]]'' and ''[[Scroll]]''.\n\nThe video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but there were/are zines from other countries too. Video game fanzines in UK have included ''[[Retrogamer]]'', ''[[Pixel Nation]]'', ''[[Capcom Fanzine]]'', ''[[Mercury (fanzine)|Mercury]]'', and ''[[Super Famicom Mini Mag]]'' among others.<ref>Bielby, Matt, ed. \"Super Express \u2013 Fanhunter: Super Play's Fanzine Round-Up.\" ''[[Super Play]]''. Issue 9, Pg.14. July 1993. {{ISSN|0966-6192}}.</ref> In France fanzines like ''[[Revival (fanzine)|Revival]]'' we circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish [[doujin]] works.\n\nMore recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of HyperPlay RPG in 2015 and Switch Player in 2017. Based in part on the above-mentioned Super Play with a focus on role-playing games and \"any-bit\" Nintendo,<ref>hyperplayrpg.com</ref> popular fanzine HyperPlay RPG has been consistently well-reviewed by the mainstream video game media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/09/hyperplay_rpg_is_a_glorious_throwback_to_the_pre-internet_days_of_homemade_fanzines|title=HyperPlay RPG Is A Glorious Throwback to the Pre-Internet Days Of Homemade Fanzines|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=27 September 2015|website=nintendolife.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Wargaming===\nSeveral fanzines exist within the hobby of [[wargaming]]. Among them is ''[[CHARGE! (magazine)|Charge!]]'', a leading international fanzine exclusively for [[miniature wargaming]] enthusiasts for the [[American Civil War]] period. Other fanzines support [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer]] and other popular rules sets.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Category see also|Football fanzines}}\nThe first association football fanzine is regarded as being [[Foul (fanzine)|Foul]], a publication that ran between 1972 and 1976.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet 7: Fan 'Power' and Democracy in Football |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |work=Department of Sociology: Sports Resources |publisher=University of Leicester |access-date=25 August 2010 |author=Gavin Barber (updated by John Williams) |year=2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184842/http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs7.html |archive-date=21 August 2010 |df= }}</ref> In the UK, most [[Premier League]] or [[The Football League|Football League]] [[association football|football]] clubs have one or more fanzines which supplement, oppose and complement the club's official magazine or matchday programme. A reasonably priced 'zine has a guaranteed audience, as is the culture of passion in being a football fan.\n\nThe longest running fanzine is ''[[The City Gent (fanzine)|The City Gent]]'', produced by supporters of [[Bradford City FC]], which first went on sale at Valley Parade in November 1984 and is now in its 26th season. Following close on its heels was Nike, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a-love-supreme.com|title=A Love Supreme \u2013 The Independent Sunderland Football Club Fanzine|author=Azure Graphic & Web Design|work=a-love-supreme.com}}</ref> which was first released in 1989. At the time it was not the first of its kind with ''Terrace Talk'' (York City), which was first published in November 1981 and ''Wanderers Worldwide'' (Bolton Wanderers) having already been established but since disappeared. In 1985 the emergent ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'' (a fanzine without a specific club focus that was subsequently launched as a mainstream magazine) promoted a 'fanzine movement' that gave birth to many more club titles during the late 1980s which was something of a glory period for fanzines.\n\nWith the widespread availability of the Internet, much of the energy that was put into football fanzines subsequently went into the development of supporters' websites. Examples of other UK football fanzines include ''[[A Love Supreme (fanzine)|A Love Supreme]]'' ([[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]]), ''[[TOOFIF]]'' ([[Fulham FC|Fulham]]), ''[[The Square Ball]]'' ([[Leeds United]]), ''4,000 Holes'' ([[Blackburn Rovers]]) and ''[[War of the Monster Trucks]]'' (a [[Sheffield Wednesday]] fanzine named after a local TV station elected not to show the final scenes of an unlikely cup victory). The Queen's Park Rangers fanzine 'A Kick up the Rs' was first published in August 1987 and is still issuing an average of 10 issues per season.\n\nFanzines are not exclusive to the top tiers of football however, with [[Northern Counties East League]] side [[Scarborough Athletic FC]] having a fanzine titled ''[[Abandon Chip!]]'', a pun based on both the perilous situation of predecessor club [[Scarborough FC]] and that club's sponsors, [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]].\n\nAnd also away from the world of Football there were a number of established fanzines, for example [[Rugby league]] has such notable publications as ''[[Who The Hell Was St. George Anyway?]]'' Rugby League fanzine, by supporters of Doncaster RLFC and ''Scarlet Turkey'' of [[Salford Red Devils|Salford City Reds]].However, due to pressure from the Internet etc. these publications no longer exist in printed form. The title of World's longest running Rugby League fanzine now belongs to ''[[The Aye of the Tigers]]'', by Castleford Tigers supporters. The fanzine movement has even spread to the United States, where ice hockey fans have produced several popular fanzines. In Chicago two examples include the formerly published ''Blue Line Magazine'' and currently ''The Committed Indian'', both produced by [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2009/05/27/The-Committed-Indian-Snark-and-in-depth-report-informs-and-entertains-27581.html | title=The Committed Indian; Snark and in-depth report informs and entertains | work=[[Chi-Town Daily News]] | date=27 May 2009 | access-date=18 October 2018 | author=Grant, Lou | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703231147/http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2009/05/27/The-Committed-Indian-Snark-and-in-depth-report-informs-and-entertains-27581.html | archive-date=3 July 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In [[St. Louis]] there are ''Game Night Revue'' and ''St Louis Game Time'' for the [[St. Louis Blues]].\n\nThere are also a number of fanzines to be found in Ireland of which [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]]'s ''Red Inc.'' is the longest running.\n\nIn the United States, sports fanzines are relatively rare. In [[Boston]] they are a bit more common. There are two fanzines sold outside Fenway Park including ''Yawkey Way Report'', which is run by a former Marine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yawkeywayreport.com/meet-the-staff/ceo-sly-egidio/|title=CEO Sly Egidio \u2013 Yawkey Way Report|newspaper=Yawkey Way Report|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/10/fenway-scene-war-among-rival-hawkers-game-programs/eTsR16JIvyshTp3S7tLhEJ/story.html|title=Fenway program hawkers' rivalry fuels competition|newspaper=Boston Globe|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\nWith the increasing availability of the Internet in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the traditional paper zine has begun to give way to the [[webzine]] (or \"e-zine\") that is easier to produce and uses the potential of the Internet to reach an ever-larger, possibly global, audience. Nonetheless, printed fanzines are still produced, either out of preference for the format or to reach people who do not have convenient Web access. Online versions of approximately 200 [[science fiction fanzine]]s will be found at Bill Burns'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eFanzines.com|title=eFanzines.com|website=efanzines.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> eFanzines web site, along with links to other [[science fiction fanzine|SF fanzine]] sites.

The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|03|29}}, three additional cases have been confirmed, including one each in Kailali and Baglung districts. All five confirmed cases have been in people who had recently returned from abroad. The four patients under treatment are reported to be in \"normal\" condition. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 8 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January. Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''. Its economy is expected to be severely affected by the pandemic due its impact on foreign employment, tourism, manufacturing, construction and trade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/govt-to-carry-out-impact-assessment-of-coronavirus-on-economy/|title=Govt to carry out impact assessment of coronavirus on economy|date=2020-03-06|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===COVID-19 pandemic===\nThe ongoing [[pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19) is caused by <!--NO DEFINITE ARTICLE (\"THE\") AS PER VIRUS'S ARTICLE--> [[SARS-COV-2|severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease 2019 |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> The outbreak was first identified in [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei, China]], in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) on 11 March 2020.<ref name=\"WHOpandemic2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020|title=WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 \u2013 11 March 2020|date=11 March 2020|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref> {{As of|2020|3|29}}, more than 708,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 33,500 deaths.<ref name=\"WOM\" /> More than 150,000 people have since recovered.<ref name=\"WOM\" >{{cite web |url= https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/|title=Coronavirus Update (Live) |work=Worldometer |date=2020 |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"JHU CSSE2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6|title=Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe virus primarily [[Transmission (medicine)|spreads]] between people in a way similar to [[influenza]], via [[respiratory droplets]] from coughing or sneezing.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url= https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf |title=Getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 |date=27 February 2020 |work=World Health Organization |url-status=live}}</ref><!--Quote=In other words, COVID-19 spreads in a similar way to flu--><ref name=\"WHO2020QA\">{{cite web |url= https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses |title=Q&A on coronaviruses |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=WHO.int |date=11 February 2020 |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref><!--Quote=The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.--><ref name=\"CDC2020Over222\">{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html |title=Symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) |date=10 February 2020 |work=CDC.gov |publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]) |access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n<!--Quote=The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person&nbsp;....
