[[sheriff]] [[deputies]] hauling the resisting husband out of their marital house while he tries unsuccessfully to take as many possessions that he can to his car that he drives off in and dissolves to a ''[[National Enquirer]]''-type newspaper with a front-page article about it in bold print [[block letter]]s called \"CHEATING HUSBAND'S HEAD EXPLODES\", then later dissolves to a bar where the wife, apparently a singer herself, is laughing and flirting with the band's drummer, who later goes home with her to the former yuppie couple's luxurious spacious house. The expelled husband, after driving down the Los Angeles (?) [[freeway]], checks into a cheap [[motel]] across town where he opens a metal briefcase revealing a [[blow up doll]] that he is inflating as his new artificial \"companion\". A [[construction]] scene appears with a new house being built and a construction worker wearing a T-shirt that says \"DIE YUPPIE SCUM\" while [[sumo]]-like men are shown dancing on the house's construction site, each carrying a 12 inch [[LaserDisc]] in their hand. The video later dissolves to the ex-husband driving in his convertible with his blow-up doll next to him in the front seat, trying to keep it seated in heavy traffic, and ends by showing him walking down the street carrying the doll in public.\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1990)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' Top Singles\n|align=\"center\"|44\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]]\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdRViFCvvUo Yer So Bad music video at YouTube]\n\n[[Category:Tom Petty songs]]\n[[Category:1990 songs]]\n[[Category:1990 singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Tom Petty]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Jeff Lynne]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Jeff Lynne]]\n[[Category:MCA Records singles]]\n\n\n{{1990s-rock-song-stub}}\n", "name_user": "108.57.53.175", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yer_So_Bad"}

The 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' is also briefly referenced when Petty, atop the [[Chrysler Building]], attempts to swat at attacking oversized mosquitoes, much like Kong swatting at the biplanes in the film.\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This might be through [[joke]]s or [[amusing]] situations, or acting foolish (as in [[slapstick]]) or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]].\n\nA popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],<ref name=Bartleby>{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> is, \"A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny\", which draws a distinction between how much of the [[comedy (drama)|comedy]] can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.\n\nSince the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style. This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting, e.g. [[Alexei Sayle]], [[Daniel Tosh]] and [[Malcolm Hardee]]. As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]], [[Des Bishop]], [[Kevin Hart]] and [[Joan Rivers]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Ben Elton]] have very strong political and cultural undertones.\n\nMany comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.\n\nDied 2nd April COVID-19\n\n==History==\n===Ancient Greeks===\n{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}\nComedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}</ref>\n\n===Shakespearean comedy===\n{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}\nThe English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.\n\n===Modern era===\nModern [[standup comedy]] has its roots in the United Kingdom in 1850 [[music hall]] theatres, where [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Stan Laurel]], and [[Dan Leno]] first performed,<ref name=\"Karno\"/> mentored by comedian and theatre impresario [[Fred Karno]], who developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s and also pioneered [[slapstick comedy]]<ref name=\"Karno\">McCabe, John. \"Comedy World of Stan Laurel\". p. 143. London: Robson Books, 2005, First edition 1975</ref>. American standup emerged in the corresponding [[vaudeville]] theatre from the 1880s to the 1930s, with such comics as [[W. C. Fields]], [[Buster Keaton]] and the [[Marx Brothers]].\n\n==Media==\nIn the modern era, as technology produced forms of [[mass media|mass communications media]], these were adapted to entertainment and comedians adapted to the new media, sometimes switching to new forms as they were introduced.\n\n===Stand-up===\n{{Main|Stand-up comedy}}\n[[File:Bob Hope, 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Bob Hope]]\nStand-up comedy is a comic [[monologue]] performed standing on a stage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition|website=Dictionary.reference.com | accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>  [[Bob Hope]] became the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, in a nearly 80-year career that included numerous [[comedy film]] roles over a five-decade span, radio, television, and entertaining armed service troops through the [[USO]].  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Dylan Moran]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], [[Patton Oswalt]] and [[Jo Brand]].\n\n===Audio recording===\n{{Main|Comedy album}}\nSome of the earliest commercial sound recordings were made by standup comedians such as [[Cal Stewart]], who recorded collections of his humorous monologues on [[Edison Records]] as early as 1898, and other labels until his death in 1919.<ref>Ronald L. Smith, ''Comedy on Record: The Complete Critical Discography'' (1988), p. 624.</ref>\n\nBandleader [[Spike Jones]] recorded 15 musical comedy [[album]]s satirizing popular and [[classical music]] from 1950 to his death in 1965. [[Tom Lehrer]] wrote and recorded five albums of songs [[satire|satirizing]] political and social issues from 1953 to 1965. Musician [[Peter Schickele]], inspired by Jones, parodied [[classical music]] with 17 albums of his music which he presented as written by \"[[P.D.Q. Bach]]\" (fictional son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]) from 1965 through 2007.\n\nIn 1968, radio [[surreal comedy]] group [[The Firesign Theatre]] revolutionized the concept of the spoken comedy album by writing and recording elaborate radio plays employing [[sound effects]] and [[multitrack recording]], which comedian [[Robin Williams]] called \"the audio equivalent of a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] painting.\" Comedy duo [[Cheech and Chong]] recorded comedy albums in similar format from 1971 through 1985.\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|Comedy film}}\n[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]\nKarno took Chaplin and Laurel on two trips to the United States to tour the vaudeville circuit. On the second one, they were recruited by the fledgling [[silent film]] industry. Chaplin became the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks & pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|isbn=9781862360105|page=51}}</ref> Chaplin wrote films such as ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''.

Keaton also started making silent comedies.\n\nFields appeared in Broadway [[musical comedies]], three silent films in 1915 and 1925, and in [[sound film]]s starting in 1926. The Marx brothers also made the transition to film in 1929, by way of two Broadway musicals.\n\nMany other comedians made sound films, such as Bob Hope (both alone, and in a series of \"[[Road to ...]]\" comedies with partner [[Bing Crosby]]), [[ventriloquist]] [[Edgar Bergen]], and [[Jerry Lewis]] (both with and without partner [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin]]).\n\nSome comedians who entered film expanded their acting skills to become dramatic actors, or started as actors specializing in comic roles, such as [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Paul Lynde]], [[Michael Keaton]], and [[Robin Williams]].\n\n===Radio===\n{{Main|Radio comedy}}\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|discuss=Talk:Comedian#Recentism; trace of regional bias?; missing info|date=September 2019}}\nIn the United Kingdom, radio has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] began his career at a [[London]] radio station called [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] began his career at [[BBC Radio Cambridgeshire|Radio Cambridgeshire]]. ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phill Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam and Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nBefore television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy. The most popular early shows in the United Kingdom include ''[[the Goon Show]]'' and ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|Television comedy}}\nOn television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]], [[James Corden]], [[John Oliver]], [[Jonathan Ross]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'' and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), and sitcoms, such as ''[[Roseanne]]'', ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and ''[[Not Going Out]]'', as well as popular panel shows like ''[[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year]]'', ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and ''[[Celebrity Juice]]''.\n\n===Internet===\nComedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Kevin Smith]], or [[Richard Herring]]. Comedians streaming videos of their stand-up include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicize their work and build an audience through social media. Examples of internet comedians include [[PewDiePie]] and [[Ludwig Aghren]], these comedians can be found on [[YouTube]] and especially [[Twitter]].\n\n==Jokes==\nThere are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' often used puns and double-entendre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-12068221|title=Puns upon a time|date=December 24, 2010|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[Stewart Francis]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick|title=Missing a trick : Correspondents 2010 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Steve|last=Bennett|website=Chortle.co.uk}}</ref> [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw|title=Richard Herring on Russell Howard's Good News Extra - Series 3|website=Youtube.com}}</ref>. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation ([[Michael McIntyre]]), whimsy ([[David O'Doherty]]), self-deprecation ([[Robin Williams]]) and parody ([[Diane Morgan]]).\n\n==Personality traits==\nIn a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored \"significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs.\" Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, \"the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis\u2014both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\"<ref name=Kelland-Psychotic>{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}</ref> However, labeling comedians' personality traits as \"psychotic\" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,<ref name=Seubsaeng-Study>{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits\u2014Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=Cooper-White>{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.\n\n==Highest-paid comedians==\n[[File:Kevin Hart (15356751923).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Hart]]]]\n''[[Forbes]]'' publishes an annual list of the most financially successful comedians in the world, similarly to their [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100 list]].

This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting, e.g. [[Alexei Sayle]], [[Daniel Tosh]] and [[Malcolm Hardee]]. As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]], [[Des Bishop]], [[Kevin Hart]] and [[Joan Rivers]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Ben Elton]] have very strong political and cultural undertones.\n\nMany comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient Greeks===\n{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}\nComedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}</ref>\n\n===Shakespearean comedy===\n{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}\nThe English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.\n\n===Modern era===\nModern [[standup comedy]] has its roots in the United Kingdom in 1850 [[music hall]] theatres, where [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Stan Laurel]], and [[Dan Leno]] first performed,<ref name=\"Karno\"/> mentored by comedian and theatre impresario [[Fred Karno]], who developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s and also pioneered [[slapstick comedy]]<ref name=\"Karno\">McCabe, John. \"Comedy World of Stan Laurel\". p. 143. London: Robson Books, 2005, First edition 1975</ref>. American standup emerged in the corresponding [[vaudeville]] theatre from the 1880s to the 1930s, with such comics as [[W. C. Fields]], [[Buster Keaton]] and the [[Marx Brothers]].\n\n==Media==\nIn the modern era, as technology produced forms of [[mass media|mass communications media]], these were adapted to entertainment and comedians adapted to the new media, sometimes switching to new forms as they were introduced.\n\n===Stand-up===\n{{Main|Stand-up comedy}}\n[[File:Bob Hope, 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Bob Hope]]\nStand-up comedy is a comic [[monologue]] performed standing on a stage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition|website=Dictionary.reference.com | accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>  [[Bob Hope]] became the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, in a nearly 80-year career that included numerous [[comedy film]] roles over a five-decade span, radio, television, and entertaining armed service troops through the [[USO]].  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Dylan Moran]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], [[Patton Oswalt]] and [[Jo Brand]].\n\n===Audio recording===\n{{Main|Comedy album}}\nSome of the earliest commercial sound recordings were made by standup comedians such as [[Cal Stewart]], who recorded collections of his humorous monologues on [[Edison Records]] as early as 1898, and other labels until his death in 1919.<ref>Ronald L. Smith, ''Comedy on Record: The Complete Critical Discography'' (1988), p. 624.</ref>\n\nBandleader [[Spike Jones]] recorded 15 musical comedy [[album]]s satirizing popular and [[classical music]] from 1950 to his death in 1965. [[Tom Lehrer]] wrote and recorded five albums of songs [[satire|satirizing]] political and social issues from 1953 to 1965. Musician [[Peter Schickele]], inspired by Jones, parodied [[classical music]] with 17 albums of his music which he presented as written by \"[[P.D.Q. Bach]]\" (fictional son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]) from 1965 through 2007.\n\nIn 1968, radio [[surreal comedy]] group [[The Firesign Theatre]] revolutionized the concept of the spoken comedy album by writing and recording elaborate radio plays employing [[sound effects]] and [[multitrack recording]], which comedian [[Robin Williams]] called \"the audio equivalent of a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] painting.\" Comedy duo [[Cheech and Chong]] recorded comedy albums in similar format from 1971 through 1985.\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|Comedy film}}\n[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]\nKarno took Chaplin and Laurel on two trips to the United States to tour the vaudeville circuit. On the second one, they were recruited by the fledgling [[silent film]] industry. Chaplin became the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy.

Keaton also started making silent comedies.\n\nFields appeared in Broadway [[musical comedies]], three silent films in 1915 and 1925, and in [[sound film]]s starting in 1926. The Marx brothers also made the transition to film in 1929, by way of two Broadway musicals.\n\nMany other comedians made sound films, such as Bob Hope (both alone, and in a series of \"[[Road to ...]]\" comedies with partner [[Bing Crosby]]), [[ventriloquist]] [[Edgar Bergen]], and [[Jerry Lewis]] (both with and without partner [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin]]).\n\nSome comedians who entered film expanded their acting skills to become dramatic actors, or started as actors specializing in comic roles, such as [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Paul Lynde]], [[Michael Keaton]], and [[Robin Williams]].\n\n===Radio===\n{{Main|Radio comedy}}\n{{Globalize|section|United Kingdom|discuss=Talk:Comedian#Recentism; trace of regional bias?; missing info|date=September 2019}}\nIn the United Kingdom, radio has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] began his career at a [[London]] radio station called [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] began his career at [[BBC Radio Cambridgeshire|Radio Cambridgeshire]]. ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phill Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam and Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nBefore television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy. The most popular early shows in the United Kingdom include ''[[the Goon Show]]'' and ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|Television comedy}}\nOn television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]], [[James Corden]], [[John Oliver]], [[Jonathan Ross]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'' and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), and sitcoms, such as ''[[Roseanne]]'', ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and ''[[Not Going Out]]'', as well as popular panel shows like ''[[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year]]'', ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and ''[[Celebrity Juice]]''.\n\n===Internet===\nComedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Kevin Smith]], or [[Richard Herring]]. Comedians streaming videos of their stand-up include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicize their work and build an audience through social media. Examples of internet comedians include [[PewDiePie]] and [[Ludwig Aghren]], these comedians can be found on [[YouTube]] and especially [[Twitter]].\n\n==Jokes==\nThere are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' often used puns and double-entendre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-12068221|title=Puns upon a time|date=December 24, 2010|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[Stewart Francis]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick|title=Missing a trick : Correspondents 2010 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Steve|last=Bennett|website=Chortle.co.uk}}</ref> [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw|title=Richard Herring on Russell Howard's Good News Extra - Series 3|website=Youtube.com}}</ref>. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation ([[Michael McIntyre]]), whimsy ([[David O'Doherty]]), self-deprecation ([[Robin Williams]]) and parody ([[Diane Morgan]]).\n\n==Personality traits==\nIn a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored \"significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs.\" Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, \"the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis\u2014both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\"<ref name=Kelland-Psychotic>{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}</ref> However, labeling comedians' personality traits as \"psychotic\" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,<ref name=Seubsaeng-Study>{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits\u2014Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=Cooper-White>{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.\n\n==Highest-paid comedians==\n[[File:Kevin Hart (15356751923).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Hart]]]]\n''[[Forbes]]'' publishes an annual list of the most financially successful comedians in the world, similarly to their [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100 list]].

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the other two throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.
