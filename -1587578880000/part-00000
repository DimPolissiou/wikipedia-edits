architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

In particular, during [[Age of Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]] anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed [[Natural history museum|natural history]]  and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers\u2019 [[colonization]] of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in [[Western Europe]]an [[Western European colonialism and colonization|colonial projects]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ecomuseums: A Sense of Place|last=Davis|first=Peter|publisher=Continuum International Publishing: London.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and \u201ccivilize\u201d the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though [[World's fair|World\u2019s Fairs]], such as [[The Great Exhibition|The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London or the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World\u2019s Fair]], were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civilization in the West|last=Kishlansky|first=M.|last2=Geary|first2=P.|last3=O\u2019Brien|first3=P.|publisher=Pearson Education.|year=2008|isbn=|edition=7|volume=C|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums.

In 1901, they developed [[Museums Journal]], the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museum\u2019s]] Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.<ref>{{Cite book|title=For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association|last=Lewis|first=G.|publisher=Quiller Press.|year=1989|isbn=1-870948-37-8|location=London|pages=}}</ref>&nbsp;<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto.|last=Shelton|first=A.|publisher=Museum Worlds|year=2013|isbn=|volume=5 |issue=1|location=|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Mensch|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Magpies on Mount Helicon.

As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed, often adding the term \u201ccritical\u201d to their new titles (i.e. [[critical race theory]]), a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features, so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Stam|first=D.|date=1983|title=The Informed Muse: The Implications of 'The New Museology' for Museum Practice|url=|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=12|pages=267\u2013283|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism.

Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success.\n\nA newer concept, the I[[Indigenization|ndigenization]] of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s 2016 appointing of [[Wanda Nanibush]] as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2016/07/22/wanda-nanibush-named-agos-first-curator-of-indigenous-art.html|title=Wanda Nanibush Named AGO's First Curator of Indigenous Art|last=Whyte|first=Murray|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> Wood Land School\u2019s takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2b2fa6_8f2b4b9eece24189920c7ab3031744f0.pdf|title=Inside a Year-Long Experiment in Indigenous Institutional Critique.|last=Hampton|first=John|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=An Indigenous curator for Indigenous artefacts: South Australia breaks new ground|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/sep/03/an-indigenous-curator-for-indigenous-artefacts-south-australia-breaks-new-ground|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Djon Mundine|url=https://www.boomerangfestival.com.au/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=113|website=Boomerang Festival|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Laura McBride|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/staff/laura-mcbride|website=Australian Museum|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TWO FIRST NATIONS CURATORS FROM MCA AUSTRALIA CHOSEN FOR VENICE BIENNALE|url=https://www.mca.com.au/press/2017/05/04/two-first-nations-curators-mca-australia-chosen-venice-biennale/|website=Museum of Contemporary Art Australia|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the [[Musqueam Indian Band]], the [[Sto:lo Nation|Sto:lo Nation Tribal Council]], the U\u2019mista Cultural Centre, and the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrncommunity.org/pages/about|title=Reciprocal Research Network|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the [[Indians of Canada Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]]\u2019; The [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation|Lubicon Cree]]\u2019s boycott of [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games#Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.2C AB|The Spirit Sings]], a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] sponsored exhibition at the [[Glenbow Museum]] [[Glenbow Museum|i]]<nowiki/>n 1[[Glenbow Museum|9]]8[[Glenbow Museum|8]], and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994;<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]]\u2019[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|s]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|2]]0[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|1]]5 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|date=2012|title=\"No History of Colonialism\": Decolonizing Practices in Indigenous Arts|url=|journal=Decolonize Me|publisher=ABC Art Books Canada.|volume=|pages=19\u201327|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museology (Lecture)|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=International Field School in Critical Museology Lecture, Concordia University.|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alsford|first=Stephen|last2=MacDonald|first2=George|date=1995|title=Canadian Museums and the Representation of Culture in a Multicultural Nation|url=|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=15\u201336|doi=10.1177/092137409500700102}}</ref>\n\n== New methodologies ==\n===Vienna Method===\nThe Vienna Method, subsequently called [[Isotype (picture language)|ISOTYPES]] was developed by the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] (Museum for Social and Economic Affairs), [[Vienna]].

By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups \u2013 including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves \u2013 as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.\n\n==== Artist interventions ====\nA central aspect of [[Institutional Critique]], some artist\u2019s interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves \u2013 like [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]\u2019s Mining the Museum (1992) at the [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas|Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas]]\u2019 Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC\u2019s [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]], or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists' Interventions|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/artists|website=Pitt Rivers museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> \u2013 while others have been done without explicit permission, like [[Andrea Fraser]]\u2019s Museum Highlights (1989) at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Fred|last2=Halle|first2=Howard|date=1993|title=Mining the Museum|jstor=25007622|journal=Grand Street|issue=44|pages=151\u2013172|doi=10.2307/25007622}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmoreart.com/2017/05/how-mining-the-museum-changed-the-art-world.html|title=How Mining the Museum Changed the Art World \u2013 BmoreArt {{!}} Baltimore Contemporary Art|website=www.bmoreart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Fred Wilson: Objects and Installations 1979-2000.|last=Berger|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland: Center for Art and Visual Culture.|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levell|first=N.|date=2013|title=Site-Specificity and Dislocation: Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas and His Haida Manga Meddling|url=|journal=Journal of Material Culture|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=93\u2013116|doi=10.1177/1359183513486231}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/kbunn/Manga.pdf|title=Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas: Meddling in the Museum.|last=UBC MOA|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Andrea Fraser \u2013 Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fraser-museum-highlights-a-gallery-talk-t13715|journal=Tate: Art & Artists.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/30/fraser-art-institutional/|title=Spotlight: Andrea Fraser {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\nOne of the best known artist interventions in a museum is [[James Luna]]\u2019s ''Artifact Piece'', which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at ''The Decade Show'' in New York in 1990. Luna, a [[Luise\u00f1o]] artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/james-luna-30545878/|title=James Luna. Smithsonian Magazine.|last=K. R.|first=Fletcher|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists \u2013 Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a and Coco Fusco \u2013 developed a traveling performance art piece called [[Couple in The Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West|The ''Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West'']] that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including [[Covent Gardens]], the [[Walker Art Center]], the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[Australian Museum|Australia Museum]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mannheim|first=Bruce|last2=Behar|first2=Ruth|date=1995|title=In Dialogue: The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odessy|url=|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=118\u2013127|doi=10.1525/var.1995.11.1.118}}</ref>\n\n==== Activist interventions ====\nWhile there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements \u2013 through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections \u2013 to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guerrillagirls.com|title=Guerrilla Girls|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] cancelled [[Corcoran Gallery of Art#Mapplethorpe scandal|''The Perfect Moment'']], an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe\u2019s photos on the exterior of the museum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html|title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|date=1989-07-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Similar protests occurred when [[David Wojnarowicz]]\u2019s film [[David Wojnarowicz#.22A Fire in My Belly.22 controversy|''A Fire in My Belly'']] was removed from the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)#Hide.2FSeek controversy|''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'']] exhibit at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/09/AR2010120905895.html|title='Fire' man: Wojnarowicz, censored by Smithsonian, sounded an alarm in dire times|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n==== Museum Hack ====\nMuseum interventions have also become increasingly popular through companies such as Museum Hack, which offers unconventional tours of large museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] or the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. These tours depart from traditional methods of museum interpretation by using humor and technology to appeal to younger generations or non-typical museum audiences. Museum Hack functions with permission from the institutions in which they work, rather than providing unsolicited tours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museumhack.com/|title=Museum Hack - Team Building Activities & Museum Tours|website=Museum Hack|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==== Internal institutional interventions ====\n\nWhile most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called ''Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 \u2013 Now''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/804-messing-with-moma-critical-interventions-at-the-museum-of-modern-art-1939-now|title=Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, 1939\u2013Now|last=Tobias|first=Jennifer|date=May 26, 2016|website=post.at.moma.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/messingwithmoma/|title=Moma.org {{!}} Interactives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Messing With MoMA|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref> In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Geismar|first1=Haidy|title=he Art of Anthropology: Questioning Contemporary Art in Ethnographic Display|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=2|issue=10|pages=183\u2013210|doi=10.1002/9781118829059.wbihms110|isbn=9781118829059}}</ref>\n\n=== Curatorial dreaming ===\nCuratorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions.

For example, while \u201cmuseology\u201d is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (mus\u00e9ologie), Spanish (museolog\u00eda), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) \u2013 while English speakers more often use the term \u201cmuseum studies\u201d to refer to that same field of study.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Oonagh|date=Spring 2018|title=Museum Studies as Critical Praxis: Developing an Active Approach to Teaching, Research and Practice|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/29/museum-studies-critical-praxis|journal=Tate Papers|volume=29|pages=|via=}}</ref> When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the [[Latin]] \u201cmuseographia\u201d (French: mus\u00e9ographie, Spanish: museograf\u00eda, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term \u201cmuseum practice\u201d or \u201coperational museology\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|title=Key Concepts of Museology|last=International Council of Museums|date=2009|website=icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616014713/http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-16|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Development of the field ==\nThe development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early [[Collecting#History|collectors]] and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during [[Age of Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]] anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed [[Natural history museum|natural history]]  and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers\u2019 [[colonization]] of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in [[Western Europe]]an [[Western European colonialism and colonization|colonial projects]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ecomuseums: A Sense of Place|last=Davis|first=Peter|publisher=Continuum International Publishing: London.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and \u201ccivilize\u201d the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though [[World's fair|World\u2019s Fairs]], such as [[The Great Exhibition|The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London or the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World\u2019s Fair]], were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civilization in the West|last=Kishlansky|first=M.|last2=Geary|first2=P.|last3=O\u2019Brien|first3=P.|publisher=Pearson Education.|year=2008|isbn=|edition=7|volume=C|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums.

In 1901, they developed [[Museums Journal]], the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museum\u2019s]] Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.<ref>{{Cite book|title=For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association|last=Lewis|first=G.|publisher=Quiller Press.|year=1989|isbn=1-870948-37-8|location=London|pages=}}</ref>&nbsp;<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto.|last=Shelton|first=A.|publisher=Museum Worlds|year=2013|isbn=|volume=5 |issue=1|location=|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Mensch|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Magpies on Mount Helicon.

In 1988, Robert Lumley\u2019s book The Museum Time Machine \u201cexpressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operations\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or \u201cold\u201d field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by [[The Sunday Times]] in Britain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Museology|last=Vergo|first=Peter|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies.<ref name=ExhibitingCultures>{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Lavine|first2=Steven D.|title=Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|date=1991|publisher=Smithsonian Press|location=Washington DC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kreamer|first2=Christine Mullen|last3=Lavine|first3=Steven|title=Museums and Communities: The Politics of Public Culture|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC}}</ref> Scholars who are engaged in various \u201cnew\u201d museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend \u201cofficially\u201d began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of \u201cradical reassessment of the roles of museums within society\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCritical theorists like [[Michel Foucault]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed \u2013 often adding the term \u201ccritical\u201d to their new titles (i.e. [[critical race theory]]) \u2013 a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features \u2013 so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Stam|first=D.|date=1983|title=The Informed Muse: The Implications of 'The New Museology' for Museum Practice|url=|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=12|pages=267\u2013283|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some of which are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others that are more traditional and less critical.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Operational museology ==\nOperational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]]), and its [[Exhibit design|exhibitions]] and programs.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Critical museology==\n\n=== Overview of the field ===\nCritical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology.

By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups \u2013 including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves \u2013 as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.\n\n==== Artist interventions ====\nA central aspect of [[Institutional Critique]], some artist\u2019s interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves \u2013 like [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]\u2019s Mining the Museum (1992) at the [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas|Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas]]\u2019 Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC\u2019s [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]], or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists' Interventions|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/artists|website=Pitt Rivers museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> \u2013 while others have been done without explicit permission, like [[Andrea Fraser]]\u2019s Museum Highlights (1989) at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Fred|last2=Halle|first2=Howard|date=1993|title=Mining the Museum|jstor=25007622|journal=Grand Street|issue=44|pages=151\u2013172|doi=10.2307/25007622}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmoreart.com/2017/05/how-mining-the-museum-changed-the-art-world.html|title=How Mining the Museum Changed the Art World \u2013 BmoreArt {{!}} Baltimore Contemporary Art|website=www.bmoreart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Fred Wilson: Objects and Installations 1979-2000.|last=Berger|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland: Center for Art and Visual Culture.|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levell|first=N.|date=2013|title=Site-Specificity and Dislocation: Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas and His Haida Manga Meddling|url=|journal=Journal of Material Culture|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=93\u2013116|doi=10.1177/1359183513486231}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/kbunn/Manga.pdf|title=Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas: Meddling in the Museum.|last=UBC MOA|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Andrea Fraser \u2013 Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fraser-museum-highlights-a-gallery-talk-t13715|journal=Tate: Art & Artists.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/30/fraser-art-institutional/|title=Spotlight: Andrea Fraser {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\nOne of the best known artist interventions in a museum is [[James Luna]]\u2019s ''Artifact Piece'', which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at ''The Decade Show'' in New York in 1990. Luna, a [[Luise\u00f1o]] artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/james-luna-30545878/|title=James Luna. Smithsonian Magazine.|last=K. R.|first=Fletcher|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists \u2013 Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a and Coco Fusco \u2013 developed a traveling performance art piece called [[Couple in The Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West|The ''Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West'']] that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including [[Covent Gardens]], the [[Walker Art Center]], the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[Australian Museum|Australia Museum]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mannheim|first=Bruce|last2=Behar|first2=Ruth|date=1995|title=In Dialogue: The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odessy|url=|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=118\u2013127|doi=10.1525/var.1995.11.1.118}}</ref>\n\n==== Activist interventions ====\nWhile there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements \u2013 through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections \u2013 to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guerrillagirls.com|title=Guerrilla Girls|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] cancelled [[Corcoran Gallery of Art#Mapplethorpe scandal|''The Perfect Moment'']], an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe\u2019s photos on the exterior of the museum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html|title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|date=1989-07-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Similar protests occurred when [[David Wojnarowicz]]\u2019s film [[David Wojnarowicz#.22A Fire in My Belly.22 controversy|''A Fire in My Belly'']] was removed from the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)#Hide.2FSeek controversy|''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'']] exhibit at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/09/AR2010120905895.html|title='Fire' man: Wojnarowicz, censored by Smithsonian, sounded an alarm in dire times|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n==== Museum Hack ====\nMuseum interventions have also become increasingly popular through companies such as Museum Hack, which offers unconventional tours of large museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] or the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. These tours depart from traditional methods of museum interpretation by using humor and technology to appeal to younger generations or non-typical museum audiences. Museum Hack functions with permission from the institutions in which they work, rather than providing unsolicited tours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museumhack.com/|title=Museum Hack - Team Building Activities & Museum Tours|website=Museum Hack|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==== Internal institutional interventions ====\n\nWhile most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called ''Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 \u2013 Now''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/804-messing-with-moma-critical-interventions-at-the-museum-of-modern-art-1939-now|title=Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, 1939\u2013Now|last=Tobias|first=Jennifer|date=May 26, 2016|website=post.at.moma.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/messingwithmoma/|title=Moma.org {{!}} Interactives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Messing With MoMA|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref> In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Geismar|first1=Haidy|title=he Art of Anthropology: Questioning Contemporary Art in Ethnographic Display|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=2|issue=10|pages=183\u2013210|doi=10.1002/9781118829059.wbihms110|isbn=9781118829059}}</ref>\n\n=== Curatorial dreaming ===\nCuratorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions.

She never lets her imperfection be an obstacle in her way instead, she intends to harm others to fill her ego. Her cruel attitude is just because of her father, Zafar ([[Sajid Hassan]]) who has also the same mindset as Nigar and has spoiled her because she has been lucky for him since her birth. Zafar also has a son, Junaid (Asad Siddiqui) who is not so special for him as Nigar is. Junaid has married an orphan girl Zeba who is unattractive most of all, she doesn't have a wealthy background as greedy Zafar has always wanted. Nigar also mistreats her and uses Junaid every single time to make her live with trouble. Zafar and Nigar has always wanted to get rid of her.\n\nNigar is in love with her cousin, Taimoor (Bilal Abbas Khan), a handsome and family-oriented man whose family she and Zafar has had been degrading for their low status in the past but not for long as now Taimoor is living a successful life. Taimoor loves Saba (Azekah Daniel), the only daughter of his mother's friend ([[Ismat Zaidi]]). This makes her become Nigar's second target. Fortunately, she catches Saba with her boyfriend, Mateen and provokes them to elope, on the day of nikkah as she will aid them. On the other hand, she uses Mateen to make mute calls to Zeba (Ammara Chaudhary) so Junaid suspects that she is having an affair. So, as planned, Saba elopes with Mateen on the day of nikkah with an apologize note and her poor mother dies of embarrassment. Taimoor also gets badly heartbroken.\n\nNigar succeeds in clearing the second target and has also partially clear first target. The leftover part is done by Zafar who bribes Mateen to be in Zeba's room when she's home alone. Plan is followed with perfection and Junaid arrives at the moment. Zafar and Nigar succeed in making Junaid divorce Zeba although she tries her best to prove her sincerity. Next morning, Zeba is found dead in the washroom. The cause is revealed to be a brain hemorrhage. Mission accomplished.\n\nNow, Nigar heads for heartbroken Taimoor. She gradually lures him out of his sorrow and makes him like her. Although Junaid is also badly suffering from the trauma of his wife's death, she doesn't care at all. She has her eyes fixed on Taimoor. She eventually starts mixing up with Taimoor's family. Taimoor's mother, Shama ([[Samina Peerzada]]) is a very gentle and caring woman who easily agrees accepting Nigar, although Nigar has been rude to her in the past. Taimoor's younger sister, Batool (Mehar Bano) resists Nigar's presence but her mother won't consider her objection as she wants her son's prosperity back. Sauleha (Mehwish Qureshi), Taimoor's older sister, is also an unadorned lady just like her mother but her simplicity is way too elaborated that she can't differentiate what's bad and good. In simple words, she is a type of immature. On the other hand, Batool is a clever, liberal and sensible girl who easily indicates Nigar's intentions.\n\nSomehow, Taimoor gets affectionate towards Nigar. Zafar conditions the marriage to be a watta satta. Batool doesn't want to marry a heartbroken Junaid who has also become bad-tempered and got in drinking. So, Nigar assures her father that she will marry Batool with Junaid after she marries Taimoor. So, Zafar agrees.\n\nOn the wedding night, Taimoor describes his family's importance to her and she should also give them priority. As it was against Nigar's aptitude, she is overwhelmed and resists in her own gesticulations. Now, Nigar's pivot motive was to get rid of whole of Taimoor's family. She uses Shama's submissive attitude as her base. Nigar emotionally forces Shama to be a bit distant from Taimoor so he could spend more time with her.

She never lets her imperfection be an obstacle in her way instead, she intends to harm others to fill her ego. Her cruel attitude is just because of her father, Zafar ([[Sajid Hassan]]) who has also the same mindset as Nigar and has spoiled her because she has been lucky for him since her birth. Zafar also has a son, Junaid (Asad Siddiqui) who is not so special for him as Nigar is. Junaid has married an orphan girl Zeba who is unattractive most of all, she doesn't have a wealthy background as greedy Zafar has always wanted. Nigar also mistreats her and uses Junaid every single time to make her live with trouble. Zafar and Nigar has always wanted to get rid of her.\n\nNigar is in love with her cousin, Taimoor (Bilal Abbas Khan), a handsome and family-oriented man whose family she and Zafar has had been degrading for their low status in the past but not for long as now Taimoor is living a successful life. Taimoor loves Saba (Azekah Daniel), the only daughter of his mother's friend ([[Ismat Zaidi]]). This makes her become Nigar's second target. Fortunately, she catches Saba with her boyfriend, Mateen and provokes them to elope, on the day of nikkah as she will aid them. On the other hand, she uses Mateen to make mute calls to Zeba (Ammara Chaudhary) so Junaid suspects that she is having an affair. So, as planned, Saba elopes with Mateen on the day of nikkah with an apologize note and her poor mother dies of embarrassment. Taimoor also gets badly heartbroken.\n\nNigar succeeds in clearing the second target and has also partially clear first target. The leftover part is done by Zafar who bribes Mateen to be in Zeba's room when she's home alone. Plan is followed with perfection and Junaid arrives at the moment. Zafar and Nigar succeed in making Junaid divorce Zeba although she tries her best to prove her sincerity. Next morning, Zeba is found dead in the washroom. The cause is revealed to be a brain hemorrhage. Mission accomplished.\n\nNow, Nigar heads for heartbroken Taimoor. She gradually lures him out of his sorrow and makes him like her. Although Junaid is also badly suffering from the trauma of his wife's death, she doesn't care at all. She has her eyes fixed on Taimoor. She eventually starts mixing up with Taimoor's family. Taimoor's mother, Shama ([[Samina Peerzada]]) is a very gentle and caring woman who easily agrees accepting Nigar, although Nigar has been rude to her in the past. Taimoor's younger sister, Batool (Mehar Bano) resists Nigar's presence but her mother won't consider her objection as she wants her son's prosperity back. Sauleha (Mehwish Qureshi), Taimoor's older sister, is also an unadorned lady just like her mother but her simplicity is way too elaborated that she can't differentiate what's bad and good. In simple words, she is a type of immature. On the other hand, Batool is a clever, liberal and sensible girl who easily indicates Nigar's intentions.\n\nSomehow, Taimoor gets affectionate towards Nigar. Zafar conditions the marriage to be a watta satta. Batool doesn't want to marry a heartbroken Junaid who has also become bad-tempered and got in drinking. So, Nigar assures her father that she will marry Batool with Junaid after she marries Taimoor. So, Zafar agrees.\n\nOn the wedding night, Taimoor describes his family's importance to her and she should also give them priority. As it was against Nigar's aptitude, she is overwhelmed and resists in her own gesticulations. Now, Nigar's pivot motive was to get rid of whole of Taimoor's family. She uses Shama's submissive attitude as her base. Nigar emotionally forces Shama to be a bit distant from Taimoor so he could spend more time with her.

Upon learning this he exclaimed, \"Verily, my fart has become a date!

In the first, the character Nicholas sticks his buttocks out of a window at night and humiliates his rival Absolom by tooting in his face. But Absolom gets revenge by thrusting a red-hot plough blade between Nicholas's cheeks (\"ammyd the ers\")\n\n{{quote|<poem>\"Sing, sweet bird, I kneen nat where thou art!\"\nThis Nicholas anon let fle a fart\nAs greet as it had been a thonder-dent\nThat with the strook he was almost yblent (blinded)\nAnd he was ready with iron hoot\nAnd Nicholas ammyd the ers he smoot.<ref>[http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/milt-par.htm  The Miller's Prologue and Tale] (lines 3805\u20133810)</ref></poem>}}\n\nThe medieval Latin joke book ''[[Facetiae]]'' includes six tales about flatulence.\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]' tales of ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' are laden with acts of flatulence. In Chapter XXVII of the second book, the giant, Pantagruel, releases a fart that \"made the earth shake for twenty-nine miles around, and the foul air he blew out created more than fifty-three thousand tiny men, dwarves and creatures of weird shapes, and then he emitted a fat wet flatulence that turned into just as many tiny stooping women.\"<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''. W.W. Norton & Co. 1990, p.214</ref>\n\nThe plays of [[William Shakespeare]] include several humorous references to flatulence, including the following from ''[[Othello]]'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>CLOWN: Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?\nFIRST MUSICIAN: Ay marry are they, sir.\nCLOWN: O, thereby hangs a tail.\nFIRST MUSICIAN: Whereby hangs a tail, sir?\nCLOWN: Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/puns-in-othello.html |title=Puns in Othello |website=Study.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Benjamin Franklin]], in his open letter \"[[To the Royal Academy of Farting]]\", satirically proposes that converting flatulence into a more agreeable form through science should be a milestone goal of the Royal Academy.<ref>Benjamin Franklin, [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=470 To the Royal Academu of Farting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305080250/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=470 |date=2013-03-05 }}, c. 1781, at teachingamericanhistory.org</ref>\n\nIn [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]'', properly named ''[ Date: 1601.] Conversation, as it was the Social Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors,'' a cupbearer at Court who's a Diarist reports:\n{{quote|In ye heat of ye talk it befel yt one did breake wind, yielding an exceding mightie and distresfull stink, whereat all did laugh full sore.<ref name = \"twain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3190/3190.txt |title=1601 by Mark Twain|website=Gutenberg.org |accessdate=2014-03-04}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Queen inquires as to the source, and receives various replies.

These are frequently used to discourage others from mentioning flatulence or to turn the embarrassment of flatulence into a pleasurable subject matter.<ref>Blank, Trevor J. \"Cheeky Behavior: The Meaning and Function of 'Fartlore' in Childhood and Adolescence.\" ''Children's Folklore Review'' Vol. 32 (2010): 61\u201385.</ref> The trick is to pin the blame on someone else, often by means of deception, or using a back and forth rhyming game that includes phrases such as the following:<ref>Blank (2010), pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n*He who declared it blared it.\n*He who observed it served it.\n*He who detected it ejected it.\n*He who rejected it respected it.\n*He who smelt it dealt it.\n*He who denied it supplied it.\n*He who said the rhyme did the crime.\n*He who accuses blew the fuses.\n*He who pointed the finger pulled the trigger.\n*He who articulated it particulated it.\n*He who introduced it produced it.\n*He who inculpated promulgated.\n*He who deduced it produced it.\n*He who was a smart-ass has a fart-ass.\n*He who sniffed it biffed it.\n*He who eulogized it aerosolized it.\n*He who rapped it cracked it.\n*He who policed it released it.\n*Whoever rebuts it cuts it.\n*Whoever said the rap did the crap.\n*Whoever had the smirk did the work.\n*Whoever spoke it broke it.\n*Whoever asked it gassed it.\n*Whoever started it farted it.\n*Whoever explained it ordained it.\n*Whoever thunk it stunk it.\n*Whoever is squealing is concealing.\n*Whoever thought it brought it.\n*Whoever gave the call gassed us all.\n*He who circulated it perpetrated it.\n*Whoever spoke last set off the blast.\n*The smeller's the feller.\n*The one who said the verse just made the atmosphere worse.\n*Whoever's poking fun is the smoking gun.\n*It twas the thinker who loosened his sphincter.\n*etc.\n\n\nAssigning blame to another can backfire: a joke about royalty has the Queen emitting flatulence, and then turning to a nearby page, exclaiming, \"Arthur, stop that!\" The page replies, \"Yes, Your Majesty.

In the first, the character Nicholas sticks his buttocks out of a window at night and humiliates his rival Absolom by farting in his face. But Absolom gets revenge by thrusting a red-hot plough blade between Nicholas's cheeks (\"ammyd the ers\")\n\n{{quote|<poem>\"Sing, sweet bird, I kneen nat where thou art!\"\nThis Nicholas anon let fle a fart\nAs greet as it had been a thonder-dent\nThat with the strook he was almost yblent (blinded)\nAnd he was ready with iron hoot\nAnd Nicholas ammyd the ers he smoot.<ref>[http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/milt-par.htm  The Miller's Prologue and Tale] (lines 3805\u20133810)</ref></poem>}}\n\nThe medieval Latin joke book ''[[Facetiae]]'' includes six tales about farting.\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]' tales of ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' are laden with acts of flatulence. In Chapter XXVII of the second book, the giant, Pantagruel, releases a fart that \"made the earth shake for twenty-nine miles around, and the foul air he blew out created more than fifty-three thousand tiny men, dwarves and creatures of weird shapes, and then he emitted a fat wet fart that turned into just as many tiny stooping women.\"<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''. W.W.

These are frequently used to discourage others from mentioning the fart or to turn the embarrassment of farting into a pleasurable subject matter.<ref>Blank, Trevor J. \"Cheeky Behavior: The Meaning and Function of 'Fartlore' in Childhood and Adolescence.\" ''Children's Folklore Review'' Vol. 32 (2010): 61\u201385.</ref> The trick is to pin the blame on someone else, often by means of deception, or using a back and forth rhyming game that includes phrases such as the following:<ref>Blank (2010), pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n*He who declared it blared it.\n*He who observed it served it.\n*He who detected it ejected it.\n*He who rejected it respected it.\n*He who smelt it dealt it.\n*He who denied it supplied it.\n*He who said the rhyme did the crime.\n*He who accuses blew the fuses.\n*He who pointed the finger pulled the trigger.\n*He who articulated it particulated it.\n*He who introduced it produced it.\n*He who inculpated promulgated.\n*He who deduced it produced it.\n*He who was a smart-ass has a fart-ass.\n*He who sniffed it biffed it.\n*He who eulogized it aerosolized it.\n*He who rapped it cracked it.\n*He who policed it released it.\n*Whoever rebuts it cuts it.\n*Whoever said the rap did the crap.\n*Whoever had the smirk did the work.\n*Whoever spoke it broke it.\n*Whoever asked it gassed it.\n*Whoever started it farted it.\n*Whoever explained it ordained it.\n*Whoever thunk it stunk it.\n*Whoever is squealing is concealing.\n*Whoever thought it brought it.\n*Whoever gave the call gassed us all.\n*He who circulated it perpetrated it.\n*Whoever spoke last set off the blast.\n*The smeller's the feller.\n*The one who said the verse just made the atmosphere worse.\n*Whoever's poking fun is the smoking gun.\n*It twas the thinker who loosened his sphincter.\n*etc.\n\n\nAssigning blame to another can backfire: a joke about royalty has the Queen emitting flatulence, and then turning to a nearby page, exclaiming, \"Arthur, stop that!\" The page replies, \"Yes, Your Majesty.

In the home game on 27 September 1936 against [[FC Lugano|Lugano]] Spadini scored a hat-trick within 11 minutes.
