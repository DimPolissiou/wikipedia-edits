The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s [[Tropical Storm Washi|Washi]] (Sendong), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], [[Typhoon Bopha|Bopha]] (Pablo), [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]], [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]], and [[Cyclone Idai|Idai]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center.

Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]].

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]], [[neoliberal]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]]. In the [[two-party system]]s of the [[English-speaking world]], these challenges mainly came from within the established parties of the left, with [[Bernie Sanders]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] pushing for more left-wing policies.\n\nThe political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new [[social media]] platforms. These included the various [[Arab Spring]] protests, the [[Occupy movement]], and the [[yellow vests movement]]. These culminated in the worldwide [[Protests of 2019]].\n\n====Democracy and authoritarianism====\nCountries which [[Democratization|democratized]] fully or partially during the decade included [[Angola]], which reformed under [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\">{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2019 |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat |publisher=Freedom House}}</ref> [[Armenia]], which went through [[2018 Armenian revolution|a revolution]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref name=\"wpost\">{{cite web |title=Three countries where democracy actually staged a comeback in 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/17/three-countries-where-democracy-actually-staged-comeback/ |work=Washington Post}}</ref> [[Ecuador]], which reformed under [[Len\u00edn Moreno]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /> [[Ethiopia]];<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref name=\"wpost\"/> and [[Malaysia]], where the ruling party [[2018 Malaysian general election|lost the first election]] since independence.<ref name=\"freedom2019\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Did an election just cause Malaysian democratisation? |url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/did-election-just-cause-malaysian-democratisation |publisher=The Lowy Institute}}</ref>\n\nLong-term [[dictator]]s ousted from power included [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]] (after 42 years),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/the-big-picture/2018/11/death-gaddafi-181103124656506.html|title=The Death of Gaddafi|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> [[Robert Mugabe]] of [[Zimbabwe]] (37 years),<ref>{{cite journal |title=Zimbabwe's army mounts a coup against Robert Mugabe |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/11/15/zimbabwes-army-mounts-a-coup-against-robert-mugabe |journal=The Economist|date=15 November 2017 }}</ref> [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of [[Yemen]] (33 years),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17177720|title=Yemen president Saleh steps down|date=27 February 2012|access-date=20 November 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Omar al-Bashir]] of [[Sudan]] (30 years),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/profile-omar-al-bashir-sudan-longtime-ruler-190411083628141.html|title=Profile: Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's longtime ruler|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> [[Hosni Mubarak]] of [[Egypt]] (29 years),<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Hosni Mubarak |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713 |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=24 March 2017 }}</ref> and [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] of [[Tunisia]] (23 years).<ref>{{cite news |title=Ben Ali: Tunisia's ousted ex-president dies in exile aged 83 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49752876 |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=19 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[Democratic backsliding]] occurred in countries such as [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite web |title=As West Fears the Rise of Autocrats, Hungary Shows What's Possible |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/world/europe/hungary-orban-democracy-far-right.html |work=New York Times}}</ref> [[Venezuela]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Final Blow to Venezuela's Democracy |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/venezuela/2016-11-01/final-blow-venezuelas-democracy |journal=Foreign Affairs|date=14 August 2019 }}</ref> and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tansel |first1=Cemal Burak |title=Authoritarian Neoliberalism and Democratic Backsliding in Turkey: Beyond the Narratives of Progress |journal=South European Society and Politics |date=2018 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013217|doi=10.1080/13608746.2018.1479945 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Arab Winter]] refers to the resurgence of [[authoritarianism]], [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] and [[Islamic extremism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/03/30/after-every-winter-comes-spring-tunisias-democratic-flowering/|title=After Every Winter Comes Spring: Tunisia's Democratic Flowering \u2013 Berkeley Political Review|author=Yun Ru Phua|date=|publisher=Bpr.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2017-02-11}}</ref> evolving in the aftermath of the Arab Spring protests in [[Arab World|Arab countries]].<ref>Ahmed H Adam and Ashley D Robinson.

The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s [[Tropical Storm Washi|Washi]] (Sendong), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], [[Typhoon Bopha|Bopha]] (Pablo), [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]], [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]], and [[Cyclone Idai|Idai]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center.

Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]].

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]], [[neoliberal]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]].

[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]] subculture and the \"Thrift Shop\" look had a considerable impact upon mainstream fashion.\n*In many Western countries, the growing of a full [[beard]] became a popular trend among young males throughout the decade, with some suggesting this was due to the influence of the hipster subculture and the [[Movember]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.scotsman.com/news/careless-whiskers-why-beards-are-back-in-fashion-1-3224369|title=Careless whiskers: Why beards are back in fashion|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122150954/https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/fashion/careless-whiskers-why-beards-are-back-in-fashion-1-3224369|archive-date=22 January 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/16/hipster-beard-guys-growing-a-beard|title=Fear not the hipster beard \u2013 for it too shall pass|author=Rob Brooks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=13 March 2015|date=16 April 2014}}</ref>\n*Other facial hair styles such as [[moustache]]s and [[goatee]]s were popular during the most part of the decade. \n*The [[Undercut (hairstyle)|undercut]], a variation of a crew cut became popular during the decade.

Dress began to skew slightly more formal, with an emphasis on tighter fitting, sleeker, and simpler clothing. A typifying example of this being the [[athleisure]] trend. Pastel colors and a variety of minimalistic patterns gained popularity in the 2010s.
