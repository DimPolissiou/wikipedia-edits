A great number of remembrances from the stone age, copper age and bronze age can be found in different local collections and in the Hungarian National Museum.\n\nDue to the lettering stones of Roman age, noble inhabitants of Aquincum liked and used the water of F\u0151k\u00fat (Main source): They built up a spa around it and the local pieces of ground have been developed as a medium category farm.\n\nThe name of the village has been mentioned in a deed of gift issued in 1286 on the 5th Sunday after Fig Sunday for the first.\n\nAfter the Moh\u00e1cs catastroph of Hungary (1526) P\u00e1ty was also controlled by the Turkish Empire, but the local people stayed here (excluding some shorter-longer periods) differently from other villages in this part. The competence and industry of the local agriculture people had a very important role in the survivorship of the village. Merchants of far countries came here regularly for steely wheat and smooth wine. Onion, fresh cherry, cheese and cottage cheese were sold in the market of Buda mainly.\n\nThe wine culture and production of the village has been lost by a great European-wide filoxera endemic. The winecellars of the old masters still have a fantastic feeling.<ref name=\"Patysite\"/>\n\n== Sights ==\n[[File:Paty-csergezan-kilato-sifu.jpg|thumb|220px|Csergez\u00e1n P\u00e1l-viewpoint]]\n[[File:Banyateto-panorama.jpg|thumb|220px|View from Mine Hilltop]]\n\n* V\u00e1rady-castle\n* Reformed Church\n* I. and II.

The Zsambeki basin are bound by M\u00e9zes (Honey) valley which is called as the Gate of P\u00e1ty also. The Paty-basin is 180 m over the sea level in general, but its outskirts reach 210-360 m high. The hills and valleys of this territory paint a very nice environment.<ref name=\"Patysite\">[http://www.paty.hu] at the [[Paty]].</ref>\n\n== Transport ==\n===Road===\nThe village of P\u00e1ty is located close to the [[Budapest]]-[[Budakeszi]] (road 8102)-[[Zs\u00e1mb\u00e9k]] (road 1102) line, [[Budapest]]-[[Vienna]] line (main road 1) and [[Highways in Hungary|M1]] motorway.\nP\u00e1ty is also connected to [[Biatorb\u00e1gy]] (road 81106) and [[Telki]] (road 11102).\n\n===Bus===\nThe mass transit are operated by Vol\u00e1nbusz.\n                                                                                                                \nFrom [[Budapest]], [[Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r]] [[Metro Line M2 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M2)]] via [[Budakeszi]]: [[781-es busz|781]], [[782-es busz|782]], [[784-es busz|784]], [[785-\u00f6s busz|785]], [[786-os busz|786]], [[787-es busz|787]], [[788-as busz|788]], [[789-es busz|789]] and [[791-es busz|791]];\n\nFrom [[Budapest]], [[Kelenf\u00f6ld railway station]] [[Metro Line M4 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M4)]] via [[Biatorb\u00e1gy]]: [[778-as busz|778]].\n\n===Train===\nThe railway 1 ([[Budapest]]\u2013[[Hegyeshalom]]\u2013[[Rajka]]) also crosses the village.\nThere is no railway stations. The closest railway station is [[Biatorb\u00e1gy]] (6 kilometers from P\u00e1ty). The railway station has P+R and B+R services. \nThe station is operated by [[Hungarian State Railways|M\u00c1V]]:\n\n'''S10''' ([[Gy\u0151r]]) - [[Tatab\u00e1nya]] - [[Kelenf\u00f6ld railway station]] [[Metro Line M4 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M4)]] - [[Budapest-D\u00e9li Railway Terminal]] [[Metro Line M2 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M2)]],\n\n'''S12''' [[Oroszl\u00e1ny]] - [[Tatab\u00e1nya]] - [[Kelenf\u00f6ld railway station]] [[Metro Line M4 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M4)]] - [[Budapest-D\u00e9li Railway Terminal]] [[Metro Line M2 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M2)]] and\n\n'''G10''' [[Gy\u0151r]] - [[Tatab\u00e1nya]] - [[Kelenf\u00f6ld railway station]] [[Metro Line M4 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M4)]] - [[Budapest Keleti railway station]] [[Metro Line M2 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M2)]] [[Metro Line M4 (Budapest Metro)|(Metro Line M4)]]\n\n== History ==\nThis station has been having a population since the ancient times. A great number of remembrances from the stone age, copper age and bronze age can be found in different local collections and in the Hungarian National Museum.\n\nDue to the lettering stones of Roman age, noble inhabitants of Aquincum liked and used the water of F\u0151k\u00fat (Main source): They built up a spa around it and the local pieces of ground have been developed as a medium category farm.\n\nThe name of the village has been mentioned in a deed of gift issued in 1286 on the 5th Sunday after Fig Sunday for the first.\n\nAfter the Moh\u00e1cs catastroph of Hungary (1526) P\u00e1ty was also controlled by the Turkish Empire, but the local people stayed here (excluding some shorter-longer periods) differently from other villages in this part. The competence and industry of the local agriculture people had a very important role in the survivorship of the village. Merchants of far countries came here regularly for steely wheat and smooth wine. Onion, fresh cherry, cheese and cottage cheese were sold in the market of Buda mainly.\n\nThe wine culture and production of the village has been lost by a great European-wide filoxera endemic. The winecellars of the old masters still have a fantastic feeling.<ref name=\"Patysite\">[http://www.paty.hu] at the [[Paty]].</ref>\n\n== Sights ==\n[[File:Paty-csergezan-kilato-sifu.jpg|thumb|220px|Csergez\u00e1n P\u00e1l-viewpoint]]\n[[File:Banyateto-panorama.jpg|thumb|220px|View from Mine Hilltop]]\n\n* V\u00e1rady-castle\n* Reformed Church\n* I. and II.
