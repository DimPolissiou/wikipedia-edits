Metadata and file data are organized into tables similar to a [[relational database]]. The file size, number of files in a [[folder (computing)|folder]], total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 [[exabyte]]s, a maximum of 18.4 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> folders and a maximum volume size of 1 [[yottabyte]] (with 64 KB [[Data cluster|clusters]]) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB [[Unicode]] text string.\n;Built-in resilience: ReFS employs an [[copy-on-write|allocation-on-write]] update strategy for metadata,<ref name=\"B8_ReFS\"/>  which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large IO batches. All ReFS metadata has built-in 64-bit checksums which are stored independently.

Other editions support less.}}\n\n{{efn|name=\"proclicenseneeded\"|If the number of physical processors in a particular server is under 64, the limit is determined by the quantity of licenses assigned to that server. In that case, the number of physical processors cannot exceed twice the number of licenses assigned to the server.}}\n\n{{efn|name=long|Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter allows ''up to two'' processor chips. Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard allows up to two virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard on that physical server. If more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed, each additional license of Windows Server 2012 allows up to two more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard, even though the physical server itself may have sufficient licenses for its processor chip count. Because Windows Server 2012 Datacenter has no limit on the number of virtual instances per licensed server, only enough licenses for the physical server are needed for any number of virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Datacenter. If the number of processor chips or virtual instances is an odd number, the number of licenses required is the same as the ''next even number''. For example, a single-processor-chip server would still require 1 license, the ''same'' as if the server were two-processor-chip and a five-processor-chip server would require 3 licenses, the ''same'' as if the server were six-processor-chip, and if 15 virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed on one server, 8 licenses of Windows Server 2012, which can cover up to 16 virtual instances, are needed (assuming, in this example, that the processor chip count does not exceed 16).}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Windows

Metadata and file data are organized into tables similar to a [[relational database]]. The file size, number of files in a [[folder (computing)|folder]], total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 [[exabyte]]s, a maximum of 18.4 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> folders and a maximum volume size of 1 [[yottabyte]] (with 64 KB [[Data cluster|clusters]]) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB [[Unicode]] text string.\n;Built-in resilience: ReFS employs an [[copy-on-write|allocation-on-write]] update strategy for metadata,<ref name=\"B8_ReFS\"/>  which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large IO batches. All ReFS metadata has built-in 64-bit checksums which are stored independently.

In that case, the number of physical processors cannot exceed twice the number of licenses assigned to the server.}}\n\n{{efn|name=long|Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter allows ''up to two'' processor chips. Each license of Windows Server 2012 Standard allows up to two virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard on that physical server. If more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard are needed, each additional license of Windows Server 2012 allows up to two more virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Standard, even though the physical server itself may have sufficient licenses for its processor chip count. Because Windows Server 2012 Datacenter has no limit on the number of virtual instances per licensed server, only enough licenses for the physical server are needed for any number of virtual instances of Windows Server 2012 Datacenter.

A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s.

The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring [[cholera]] epidemics during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|date=22 December 2001|title=Death and miasma in Victorian London: an obstinate belief|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1469\u20131471|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1121911|pmid=11751359|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1469}}</ref> Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1919\u20131920, late 1940s, and 1950s: Communism ===\n{{Main|First Red Scare|Second Red Scare}}\nDuring the year 1919, the year 1920, the late 1940s, and the 1950s, the United States had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the [[Soviet Union]]. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] led a witch hunt against communists called [[McCarthyism]], where people were accused of being communists.\n\n=== 1920s\u2013present: \"The Devil's music\" ===\n''This section of this page is in need of updating.''\n\nOver the years, there has been concern of various types of new music, often called \"the devil's music\", causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations. While the types of music mainly labeled \"the devil's music\" has changed, along with the nature of the accusations, this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant. It could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella. While most notable in the United States, other countries such as [[Romania]]<ref>http://fto.ro/altarul-reintregirii/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2016_3_18.-Nechita-307-323.pdf</ref> have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well.\n\n[[Blues]] was one of the first music genres to receive this label, mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior.<ref>SFGate</ref> In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.\n\n[[Jazz]] was another early receiver of the label. At the time, traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality.<ref>Paula S. Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of a link between music and [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism as a theistic religion]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated in particular with satanism as a theistic religion, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backmasking in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, a rumor boosted by the film [[The Exorcist]], where satanic backmasking was a plot point. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to other definitions of \"devil music\" as described above. There are also applications of the term to musical genres that to others would seem unusual or irrational to be labeled \"the devil's music\", such as [Country music|country] and [Christian rock]. <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170910184845/http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/county_music_filth.htm] Archived post from a website that espouses the claim.</ref><ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20190124110541/http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/christian_rock-devil.htm] Archived post from a website that espouses the claim.</ref>\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy.

Lowenkron wrote: \"Concerned about the increasing expansion and acceptance of so-called 'sexual deviations' during what was called the libertarian age from the 1960s to the early 1970s,\" conservative groups and traditional groups \"saw in the fight against 'child sexual abuse' the chance\" to \"revive fears about crime and sexual dangers\".<ref name=AllAgainstPedophilia/>\n\nThe moral panic over sex offenders and pedophiles became very intense in the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the media began to report more frequently on cases of children being raped, kidnapped or murdered. In 1981, a 6 year old boy named [[Murder of Adam Walsh|Adam Walsh]] was abducted, murdered, and beheaded. Investigators believe the murderer was serial killer [[Ottis Toole]]. The murder of Adam Walsh took over nationwide news and led to a moral panic over [[child abduction]].

In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagined moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=993\u20131012 |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}</ref> Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.<ref name=cohen/>{{rp|xxvi\u2013xxxi}}\n\nWriting in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |journal=Social & Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

Cohen used the term \"moral panic\" to characterize the reactions of the media, the public, and agents of social control to youth disturbances.<ref name=cohen/> This work, involving the [[Mods and rockers|Mods and Rockers]], demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance. According to Cohen, these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself, hence the term \"folk devils\".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Donna |last1=Killingbeck |year=2001 |title=The role of television news in the construction of school violence as a 'moral panic' |journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=186\u2013202 |url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is3/killingbeck.html }}</ref>\n\nIn a more recent edition of ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics,'' Cohen suggested that the term \"panic\" in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control. Cohen maintained that \"panic\" is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor.<ref name=cohen/>\n\n==Mass media==\nThe concept of \"moral panic\" has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media.<ref name=cohen/> Cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public's knowledge about deviance and social problems. He further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people.<ref name=cohen/>  Christian Joppke, furthers the importance of media as he notes, shifts in public attention 'can trigger the decline of movements and fuel the rise of others'.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ramen|first=Sabrina|last2=Hassenstat|first2=Christine|date=September 2013|title=The Know Nothing Party: Three Theories About its Rise and Demise|url=|journal=Politics and Religion|volume=6|issue=3|pages=572\u2013573|via=Social Science Premium Collection}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Cohen, the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas:<ref name=cohen/>\n* Setting the agenda \u2013 selecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy, then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic.\n* Transmitting the images \u2013 transmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics.\n* Breaking the silence and making the claim.\n\n==Characteristics==\nMoral panics have several distinct features. According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, moral panic consists of the following characteristics:<ref name=Goode/>\n* Concern \u2013 There must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society.\n* Hostility \u2013 Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become \"folk devils\". A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s. A short-lived national [[Know Nothing|The Know-Nothing Party]] embodied the Moral Panic Theory, focusing upon Catholic immigrants and labelling them as members of an \"out-group\". This was due to their rejection of traditional [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] criticism of immigrants from Catholic nations centered upon the control of the Pope over the church.  The widespread concern regarding the perceive social threat is exhibited by the showing of the Know Nothing Party in the [[Presidential election of 1856|Presidential Election of 1856]], where they won 21.5% of the total vote share. It is important to note the quick decline in political success for the Know Nothing Party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat, an indicative feature of the movements situated in Moral Panic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Downs|first=A.|date=1972|title=Up with Ecology and Down with Ecology: The 'Issue Attention' Cycle|url=|journal=The Public Interest|volume=28|issue=38\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===20th\u201321st century: public health===\nThe fear of disease (or fear of threats to [[public health]]) and spread of panic dates back many centuries and continues into the 21st century with diseases such as [[AIDS]]. Cohen's idea of the \"folk devil\"<ref name=cohen/> and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear. Prior to the 20th century, an intense concentration on hygiene emerged with a medical belief referred to as [[miasma theory]], which stated that disease was the direct result of the polluting emanations of filth: sewer gas, garbage fumes, and stenches that polluted air and water, which results in an epidemic. The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring [[cholera]] epidemics during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|date=22 December 2001|title=Death and miasma in Victorian London: an obstinate belief|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1469\u20131471|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1121911|pmid=11751359|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1469}}</ref> Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1919\u20131920, late 1940s, and 1950s: Communism ===\n{{Main|First Red Scare|Second Red Scare}}\nDuring the year 1919, the year 1920, the late 1940s, and the 1950s, the United States had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the [[Soviet Union]]. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] led a witch hunt against communists called [[McCarthyism]], where people were accused of being communists.\n\n=== 1920s\u2013present: \"The Devil's music\" ===\n''This section of this page is in need of updating.''\n\nOver the years, there has been concern of various types of new music, often called \"the devil's music\", causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations. While the types of music mainly labeled \"the devil's music\" has changed, along with the nature of the accusations, this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant. It could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella. While most notable in the United States, other countries such as [[Romania]]<ref>http://fto.ro/altarul-reintregirii/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2016_3_18.-Nechita-307-323.pdf</ref> have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well.\n\n[[Blues]] was one of the first music genres to receive this label, mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior.<ref>SFGate</ref> In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.\n\n[[Jazz]] was another early receiver of the label. At the time, traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality.<ref>Paula S. Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of a link between music and [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism as a religion]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated in particular with satanism as a religion, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backmasking in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, a rumor boosted by the film [[The Exorcist]], where satanic backmasking was a plot point. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to other definitions of \"devil music\" as described above.\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy. It was further fuelled by highly popular films of the late 1950s, including ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'', ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', and the 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''.

However, scientists gained a far better understanding of HIV/AIDS as it grew in the 1980s and moved into the 1990s and beyond. The illness was still negatively viewed by many as either being caused by or passed on through the gay community. Once it became clear that this wasn't the case, the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards of the younger generation (both male and female), resulting in another moral panic. Authors behind ''AIDS: Rights, Risk, and Reason'' argued that \"British TV and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture\u2014a culture that does not regard gay men as fully or properly human.

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population,{{efn|Morales is described as the first indigenous president of Bolivia in academic studies of his presidency, such as those of Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian,{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=180}} Webber,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=1}} Philip and Panizza,{{sfn|Philip|Panizza|2011|p=57}} and Farthing and Kohl,{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=1}} as well as in press reports, such as those of [[BBC News]],<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> However, there have been challenges to this claim by critics who have asserted that Morales probably has some European ancestry, and thus on genetic grounds is technically ''[[mestizo]]'' rather than solely indigenous.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} Further, former president [[Enrique Pe\u00f1aranda]] was of substantially indigenous origin.

A [[socialist]], he is the head of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) party.\n\n<!--Early life and political activism-->\nBorn to an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] family of [[subsistence farmers]] in Isallawi, [[Orinoca Canton]], Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to [[Chapare Province]]. Growing [[coca]] and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the ''[[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia|campesino]]'' (\"rural laborers\") union. In that capacity, he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to [[coca eradication|eradicate coca]] as part of the [[War on Drugs]], denouncing these as an [[imperialist]] violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government [[direct action]] protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS, and was elected to [[Bolivian National Congress, 1997\u20132002|Congress]] in 1997. Coupled with [[populist]] rhetoric, his campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the more equal redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the [[Cochabamba Water War]] and [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]]. In 2002, he was expelled from Congress for encouraging anti-government protesters, although he came second in [[2002 Bolivian general election|that year's presidential election]].\n\n<!--Presidency-->\n[[2005 Bolivian general election|Once elected in 2005]], Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending and emphasized projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing [[neoliberalism]], Morales' government moved Bolivia towards a [[mixed economy]], reduced its dependence on the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and oversaw strong economic growth. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American [[pink tide]]\u2014especially [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]'s Venezuela and [[Fidel Castro]]'s Cuba\u2014and signed Bolivia into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. His administration opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of [[media luna|Bolivia's eastern provinces]], won [[2008 Bolivian vote of confidence referendum|a 2008 recall referendum]], and instituted a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] that established Bolivia as a [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]]. [[2009 Bolivian general election|Re-elected in 2009]] and [[2014 Bolivian general election|2014]], he oversaw Bolivia's admission to the [[Bank of the South]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] although his popularity was dented by attempts to abolish presidential [[term limits]].

Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} Morales joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2 Central Tournament.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=39}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Folha de coca.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Mate de coca Peru.jpg\n| width2 = 198\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer =  Morales policy was \"Coca Yes, Cocaine No\".

Organizing soccer tournaments, among union members he earned the nickname of \"the young ball player\" because of his tendency to organize matches during meeting recesses.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=39}} Influenced in joining the union by wider events, in 1980 the far-right General [[Luis Garc\u00eda Meza]] had seized power in a military coup, banning other political parties and declaring himself president; for Morales, a \"foundational event in his relationship with politics\" occurred in 1981, when a ''campesino'' (coca grower) was accused of cocaine trafficking by soldiers, beaten up, and burned to death.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=40\u201341}} In 1982 the leftist [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] and the [[Democratic and Popular Union]] (''Unidad Democr\u00e1tica y Popular'' \u2013 UDP) took power in [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections, before implementing [[neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalist]] reforms and privatizing much of the state sector with US support; hyperinflation came under control, but unemployment rose to 25%.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1pp=40\u201341|2a1=Philip|2a2=Panizza|2y=2011|2pp=76&ndash;77}} Becoming increasingly active in the union, from 1982 to 1983, Morales served as the General Secretary of his local San Francisco syndicate.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=42}} However, in 1983, Morales's father Dionisio died, and although he missed the funeral he temporarily retreated from his union work to organize his father's affairs.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=40\u201341, 57\u201358}}\n\nFighting their [[War on Drugs]], the U.S. government hoped to stem the cocaine trade by preventing the production of coca; they pressured the Bolivian government to eradicate it, sending troops to Bolivia to aid the operation.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=41}} Bolivian troops would burn coca crops and in many cases beat up coca growers who challenged them.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=109}} Angered by this, Morales returned to ''cocalero'' campaigning; like many of his comrades, he refused the US$2,500 compensation offered by the government for each acre of coca he eradicated. Deeply embedded in Bolivian culture, the ''campesinos'' had an ancestral relationship with coca and did not want to lose their most profitable means of subsistence. For them, it was an issue of national sovereignty, with the U.S. viewed as [[imperialism|imperalists]]; activists regularly proclaimed \"Long live coca! Death to the Yankees!\" (\"''Causachun coca!

He adopted a policy of \"[[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]\", implementing economic liberalization and widescale privatization of state-owned assets.{{sfn|Harten|2011|pp=97\u201399}} S\u00e1nchez also agreed with the U.S. DEA to relaunch its offensive against the Bolivian coca growers, committing Bolivia to eradicating {{convert|12500|acre|ha}} of coca by March 1994 in exchange for $20 million worth of US aid, something Morales claimed would be opposed by the cocalero movement.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nIn August 1994 Morales was arrested; reporters present at the scene witnessed him being beaten and accosted with racial slurs by civil agents. Accused of sedition, in jail he began a dry hunger strike to protest his arrest.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=45}} The following day, 3000 ''campesinos'' began a {{convert|360|mi|km|adj=on}} march from [[Villa Tunari]] to La Paz. Morales would be freed on September 7, and soon joined the march, which arrived at its destination on September 19, where they covered the city with political graffiti.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=45\u201347}} He was again arrested in April 1995 during a sting operation that rounded up those at a meeting of the Andean Council of Coca Producers that he was chairing on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Accusing the group of plotting a coup with the aid of Colombia's [[FARC]] and Peru's [[Shining Path]], a number of his comrades were tortured, although no evidence of a coup was brought forth and he was freed within a week.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=47}} He proceeded to Argentina to attend a seminar on liberation struggles.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n==Political rise==\n===The ASP, IPSP, and MAS: 1995\u201399===\nMembers of the ''sindicato'' social movement first suggested a move into the political arena in 1986. This was controversial, with many fearing that politicians would co-opt the movement for personal gain.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=83}} Morales began supporting the formation of a political wing in 1989, although a consensus in favor of its formation only emerged in 1993.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} On March 27, 1995, at the 7th Congress of the [[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia]] (''Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical \u00danica de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia'' \u2013 CSUTCB), a \"political instrument\" (a term employed over \"political party\") was formed, named the [[Assembly for the Sovereignty of the Peoples]] (''Asamblea por la Sobern\u00eda de los Pueblos'' \u2013 ASP).{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=84|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=60}} At the ASP's 1st Congress, the CSUTCB participated alongside three other Bolivian unions, representing miners, peasants and indigenous peoples.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} In 1996, Morales was appointed chairman of the Committee of the Six Federations of the Tropics of Cochabamba, a position that he retained until 2006.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=79}}\n\nBolivia's [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] (''Corte Nacional Electoral'' \u2013 CNE) refused to recognize the ASP, citing minor procedural infringements.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} The coca activists circumvented this problem by running under the banner of the [[United Left (Bolivia)|United Left]] (IU), a coalition of leftist parties headed by the [[Communist Party of Bolivia]] (''Partido Comunista Boliviano'' \u2013 PCB).{{sfnm|1a1=Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|1y=2008|1p=24|2a1=Sivak|2y=2010|2p=79|3a1=Harten|3y=2011|3p=84|4a1=Webber|4y=2011|4p=60}} They won landslide victories in those areas which were local strongholds of the movement, producing 11 mayors and 49 municipal councilors.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=84}} Morales was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly|National Congress]] as a representative for El Chapare, having secured 70.1% of the local vote.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=79}} In the [[1997 Bolivian legislative election|national elections of 1997]], the IU/ASP gained four seats in Congress, obtaining 3.7% of the national vote, with this rising to 17.5% in the department of Cochabamba.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=85}} The election resulted in the establishment of a coalition government led by the right-wing [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] (''Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Nacionalista'' \u2013 ADN), with [[Hugo Banzer]] as President; Morales lambasted him as \"the worst politician in Bolivian history\".{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=79\u201380}}\n\n[[File:MAS XVI Anniversary Celebration.jpg|thumb|MAS-IPSP partisans celebrate the 16th anniversary of the IPSP party's founding in [[Sacaba]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]].]]\nRising electoral success was accompanied by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent [[Alejo V\u00e9liz]] and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=85}} The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (''Instrumento Pol\u00edtico por la Soberan\u00eda de los Pueblos'' \u2013 IPSP).{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=85|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=60}} The movement's bases defected ''en masse'' to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and V\u00e9liz to join the center-right [[New Republican Force]] (''Nueva Fuerza Republicana'' \u2013 NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the ''cocalero'' cause.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=86}} Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another ''cocalero'' march from El Chapare to la Paz,{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=81}} and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly accused him of being involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.{{sfn|Sivak|2010|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nMorales came to an agreement with [[David A\u00f1ez Pedraza]], the leader of a defunct yet still registered party named the Movement for Socialism (MAS); under this agreement, Morales and the Six Federaci\u00f3nes could take over the party name, with Pendraza stipulating the condition that they must maintain its own acronym, name and colors.

the global imagination\".{{sfn|Pearce|2011|p=xv}} Morales's government has been seen as part of the [[pink tide]] of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Pearce|1y=2011|1p=xv|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=1}} It has been praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=154}} who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a \"political laboratory\"{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=1}} or \"a living workshop\" for the development of an alternative to capitalism.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=5}} Domestically, Morales's support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> For these communities, who had felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales \"invokes a sense of dignity and destiny\" in a way that no other contemporary politician has done.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=227}} He has received the support of many [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favored him over the right-wing opposition.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}}\n\nBased on interviews conducted among Bolivians in 2012, John Crabtree and Ann Chaplin described the previous years of Morales's rule with the observation that: \"for many\u2014perhaps most\u2014Bolivians, this was a period when ordinary people felt the benefits of policy in ways that had not been the case for decades, if ever.\"{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin added that Morales's administration had made \"important changes... that will probably be difficult to reverse\", including poverty reduction, the removal of some regional inequalities, and side-lining of some previously dominant political actors in favor of others who had been encouraged and enabled by his government.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}}\n\nCritics, particularly in the U.S. government, have varyingly termed him \"a left-wing radical, a partner of narco-traffickers and a terrorist\".{{sfn|Sivak|2011|p=173}} Opposition to Morales's governance has centered in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}} Many of these leftist critics were unhappy that Morales's government did not make a total break with global capitalism.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} His government has also faced many of the same complaints directed at previous Bolivian administrations, revolving around such issues as \"concentration of power, corruption, incompetent bureaucracies, and disrespect for civil liberties\".{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=144}}\n\nCrabtree and Chaplin's study led them to conclude that while Morales's initial election had brought \"huge expectations\" from many Bolivians, especially in the social movements, there had been \"inevitable frustrations\" at his administration's inability to deliver on everything that they had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vii}} They thought that the \"heady optimism\" that had characterized Morales's first term in office had given way to \"a climate of questioning and growing criticism of the government and its policies\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Although the Bolivian economy had grown, the material benefits had not been as high as many Bolivians had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin argued that the experiences of his administration had \"drawn attention to the difficulties involved in bringing change in the patterns of development in one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vi}} Similarly, Harten thought that Morales's discourse of \"the people\" against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic policy of Evo Morales]]\n* [[Foreign policy of Evo

[[President of Bolivia]] from 2006 to 2019. Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population,{{efn|Morales is described as the first indigenous president of Bolivia in academic studies of his presidency, such as those of Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian,{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=180}} Webber,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=1}} Philip and Panizza,{{sfn|Philip|Panizza|2011|p=57}} and Farthing and Kohl,{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=1}} as well as in press reports, such as those of [[BBC News]],<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> However, there have been challenges to this claim by critics who have asserted that Morales probably has some European ancestry, and thus on genetic grounds is technically ''[[mestizo]]'' rather than solely indigenous.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} Further, former president [[Enrique Pe\u00f1aranda]] was of substantially indigenous origin. Harten asserted that this argument was \"misguided[,] wrong[... and] above all irrelevant\" because regardless of his genetic makeup, the majority of Bolivians perceive Morales as being the first indigenous president.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} In Bolivian society, indigeneity is a fluid concept rooted in cultural identity;{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=7}} for instance, many indigenous individuals that have settled in urban areas and abandoned their traditional rural customs have come to identify as ''mestizo''.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=22}} }} his administration focused on the implementation of [[leftist]] policies, poverty reduction, and combating the influence of the [[United States]] and multinational corporations in Bolivia. A [[socialist]], he is the head of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) party.\n\n<!--Early life and political activism-->\nBorn to an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] family of [[subsistence farmers]] in Isallawi, [[Orinoca Canton]], Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to [[Chapare Province]]. Growing [[coca]] and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the ''[[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia|campesino]]'' (\"rural laborers\") union. In that capacity, he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to [[coca eradication|eradicate coca]] as part of the [[War on Drugs]], denouncing these as an [[imperialist]] violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government [[direct action]] protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS, and was elected to [[Bolivian National Congress, 1997\u20132002|Congress]] in 1997. Coupled with [[populist]] rhetoric, his campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the more equal redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the [[Cochabamba Water War]] and [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]]. In 2002, he was expelled from Congress for encouraging anti-government protesters, although he came second in [[2002 Bolivian general election|that year's presidential election]].\n\n<!--Presidency-->\n[[2005 Bolivian general election|Once elected in 2005]], Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending and emphasized projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing [[neoliberalism]], Morales' government moved Bolivia towards a [[mixed economy]], reduced its dependence on the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], and oversaw strong economic growth. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American [[pink tide]]\u2014especially [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]'s Venezuela and [[Fidel Castro]]'s Cuba\u2014and signed Bolivia into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. His administration opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of [[media luna|Bolivia's eastern provinces]], won [[2008 Bolivian vote of confidence referendum|a 2008 recall referendum]], and instituted a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] that established Bolivia as a [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]]. [[2009 Bolivian general election|Re-elected in 2009]] and [[2014 Bolivian general election|2014]], he oversaw Bolivia's admission to the [[Bank of the South]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] although his popularity was dented by attempts to abolish presidential [[term limits]]. Following the disputed [[2019 Bolivian general election|2019 general election]] and [[2019 Bolivian protests|the ensuing unrest]], [[Evo Morales government resignation|Morales agreed to military calls for his resignation]], after which he was granted [[Right of asylum|political asylum]], first in Mexico, then in Argentina. \n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nMorales was decorated with various international awards and received praise both for overseeing economic growth and for significantly reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia. His supporters lauded him as a champion of [[indigenous rights]], [[anti-imperialism]], and [[environmentalism]]. He faced accusations that his defence of coca contributed to illegal [[cocaine]] production and that his calls for domestic protest represented [[sedition]] and [[terrorism]].\n\n==Early life and activism==\n===Childhood, education, and military service: 1959\u201378===\n\nMorales was born in the small rural village of Isallawi in [[Orinoca Canton]], part of western Bolivia's [[Oruro Department]], on October 26, 1959 to a family from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Aymara people]].<ref name=oct17bbc />{{sfnm|1a1=Harten|1y=2011|1p=35|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=62}} One of seven children born to Dionisio Morales Choque and his wife Mar\u00eda Ayma Mamani,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/amp/entrega-modulo-educativo-maria-ayma-dice-nunca-influyo-nombramiento-obras-137307.html | title=Evo entrega modulo educativo \"Maria Ayma\" y dice que nunca influy\u00f3 en nombramiento de obras - Diario Pagina Siete | access-date=January 26, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904084711/https://www.paginasiete.bo/amp/entrega-modulo-educativo-maria-ayma-dice-nunca-influyo-nombramiento-obras-137307.html | archive-date=September 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref> only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Gutsch|1y=2006|2a1=Sivak|2y=2010|2p=32|3a1=Harten|3y=2011|3p=35}} His mother almost died from a [[Postpartum hemorrhage|postpartum haemorrhage]] following his birth.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}} In keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the [[placenta]] produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}} His childhood home was a traditional [[adobe]] house,{{sfn|Sivak|2010|p=33}} and he grew up speaking the [[Aymara language]], although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1p=33|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=7|3a1=Webber|3y=2011|3p=63}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Aymara ceremony copacabana 4.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Fishing boat Lake Poopo.jpg\n| width2 = 198\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Aymara in traditional dress (left); [[Poop\u00f3 Lake]] was the dominant geographical feature around Morales's home village of Isallawi (right).{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=35}}\n}}\n\nMorales's family were farmers; from an early age, he helped them to plant and harvest crops and guard their herd of llamas and sheep, taking a homemade soccer ball to amuse himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1p=32|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=35}} As a toddler, he briefly attended Orinoca's preparatory school, and at five began schooling at the single-room primary school in Isallawi.{{sfnm|1a1=Sivak|1y=2010|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Harten|2y=2011|2p=36}} Aged 6, he spent six months in northern Argentina with his sister and father.

the global imagination\".{{sfn|Pearce|2011|p=xv}} Morales's government has been seen as part of the [[pink tide]] of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Pearce|1y=2011|1p=xv|2a1=Webber|2y=2011|2p=1}} It has been praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left,{{sfn|Webber|2011|p=154}} who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a \"political laboratory\"{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz-Pogossian|2008|p=1}} or \"a living workshop\" for the development of an alternative to capitalism.{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=5}} Domestically, Morales's support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> For these communities, who had felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales \"invokes a sense of dignity and destiny\" in a way that no other contemporary politician has done.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=227}} He has received the support of many [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favored him over the right-wing opposition.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}}\n\nBased on interviews conducted among Bolivians in 2012, John Crabtree and Ann Chaplin described the previous years of Morales's rule with the observation that: \"for many\u2014perhaps most\u2014Bolivians, this was a period when ordinary people felt the benefits of policy in ways that had not been the case for decades, if ever.\"{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin added that Morales's administration had made \"important changes... that will probably be difficult to reverse\", including poverty reduction, the removal of some regional inequalities, and side-lining of some previously dominant political actors in favor of others who had been encouraged and enabled by his government.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}}\n\nCritics, particularly in the U.S. government, have varyingly termed him \"a left-wing radical, a partner of narco-traffickers and a terrorist\".{{sfn|Sivak|2011|p=173}} Opposition to Morales's governance has centered in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property.<ref name=\"BBC bio\"/> His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.{{sfn|Webber|2011|pp=157\u201358}} Many of these leftist critics were unhappy that Morales's government did not make a total break with global capitalism.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} His government has also faced many of the same complaints directed at previous Bolivian administrations, revolving around such issues as \"concentration of power, corruption, incompetent bureaucracies, and disrespect for civil liberties\".{{sfn|Farthing|Kohl|2014|p=144}}\n\nCrabtree and Chaplin's study led them to conclude that while Morales's initial election had brought \"huge expectations\" from many Bolivians, especially in the social movements, there had been \"inevitable frustrations\" at his administration's inability to deliver on everything that they had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vii}} They thought that the \"heady optimism\" that had characterized Morales's first term in office had given way to \"a climate of questioning and growing criticism of the government and its policies\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Although the Bolivian economy had grown, the material benefits had not been as high as many Bolivians had hoped.{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=ix}} Crabtree and Chaplin argued that the experiences of his administration had \"drawn attention to the difficulties involved in bringing change in the patterns of development in one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations\".{{sfn|Crabtree|Chaplin|2013|p=vi}} Similarly, Harten thought that Morales's discourse of \"the people\" against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia.{{sfn|Harten|2011|p=229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic policy of Evo Morales]]\n* [[Foreign policy of Evo
