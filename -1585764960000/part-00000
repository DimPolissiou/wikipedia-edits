The airport has been managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II since January 2007. It was originally named Pangkalpinang Airport built since the Japanese occupation of 1942 as a defense against Allied soldiers. In accordance with the letter of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Transportation. 378 / TLK / DEPHUB / VIII / 85 dated 22 August 1985 the name of the airport was changed to airport. Based on the Decree of the Minister of Transportation No. SK.1 / AU.106 / PHB-99 dated 25 August 1999, Pangkalpinang Airport was changed to Amir Bangka Airport, which is an UPT from Vertical Institution of Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Transportation.\n\nSince January 1, 2007, the airport was handed over to a state-owned company in charge of the management of several airports in western Indonesia, namely PT. Angkasa Pura II (Persero).\nFor air space controlled by the Air Traffic Service Unit of Depati Amir Airport initially only serves the area around the airport up to 2500 feet altitude. In 1992, the border area expanded, with a horizontal limit of up to 30 Nm, and a vertical limit of 15,000 feet. In 2008 after being managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, horizontal boundaries widened to a distance of varied 80 Nm, while the vertical limit to 24,500 feet.\nSince January 1, 2013 airspace management at Depati Amir Airport has been transferred to the Indonesian Air Navigation Service Provider or AirAsia Operator. It is one of the two main airport in Bangka Belitung province, the other being [[H.A.S. Hanandjoeddin International Airport]] in [[Belitung]].\n\n==Future planning==\n\nIn 1978, the foundation was moved to the west for about 75 meters, with a length of 1200m. Then gradually continue to be extended 1600 m, 1800m, 2000m and in 2013 the runway reached the length of 2600m x 45m. This airport runway has been able to land aircraft type Boeing 737-800NG / 900ER, & Airbus A320, although in a limited capacity.\nThe aircraft parking lot (apron) has also been overlaid several times (asphalt thickening). The airport apron has been able to accommodate 4 narrow-body aircraft at once, such as Boeing 737-800NG / 900ER, & Airbus A320.\n\n==Terminal==\n\nAfter multiple delays, a new airport terminal finally started operation on 11 January 2017. With an investment of about 300 billion rupiah, the construction of the terminal is able to increase the passenger capacity of 350 thousand passengers per year to more than 1.5 million passengers per year. The new terminal building stands on an area of 12 thousand square meters of total land area of about 152 hectares. Nevertheless, it currently only serves domestic flights.\n\nRevitalization is done on the airport's landside which includes construction of a new terminal, improvement of terminal facilities, construction of a new apron, as well as construction of a larger and more spacious car parking area. Besides being larger, the new terminal also has a modern design and is equipped with additional amenities such as food courts, executive break room, internet facilities, disabled toilets, as well as a room mother and child.<ref>[http://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20170111085726-92-185482/bandara-pangkalpinang-kini-punya-terminal-senilai-rp300-m/ Bandara Pangkalpinang Kini Punya Terminal Senilai Rp300 M]</ref> Other facilities include 12 check-in counters, 3 departure gates, and 2 jetbridges.

Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order. This view was also taken by a succession of German scholars, in England by C. G. Addison, and in France by a whole series of conspicuous writers: ''e.g.'' Mignet, Guizot, Renan, Lavocat. Others, like Boutaric, while rejecting the charge of heresy, accepted the evidence for the ''spuitio'' and the indecent kisses, explaining the former as a formula of forgotten meaning and the latter as a sign of ''fraternit\u00e9!''{{-\"}} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911.</ref>\n\nSince 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with the \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by [[\u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi]],<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/><ref name=Waite/> which contains binary elements representing the \"[[Symbol|symbolization]] of the equilibrium of opposites\"<ref name=Strube/> (e.g. [[Human\u2013animal hybrid|half-human and half-animal]], [[Androgyny|male and female]], [[good and evil]], on and off, etc.).<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> On one hand, L\u00e9vi's intention was to symbolize his concept of balance that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light;<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a tradition that should result in a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/>\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Baphomet'' appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the [[Crusades|crusader]] Anselm of Ribemont:\n{|\n|\n{{quote|''Sequenti die aurora apparente, altis vocibus '''Baphometh''' invocaverunt; et nos Deum nostrum in cordibus nostris deprecantes, impetum facientes in eos, de muris civitatis omnes expulimus.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cIUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT142 |title=Godefridi Bullonii epistolae et diplomata; accedunt appendices |first=Godfrey |last=Bullonii (of Bouillon) |date=30 March 2018 |via=Google Books}}</ref>}}\n|\n{{quote|As the next day dawned, they called loudly upon '''Baphometh'''; and we prayed silently in our hearts to God, then we attacked and forced all of them outside the city walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|Bate|2010|p=29}}</ref>}}\n|}\n[[Raymond of Aguilers]], a chronicler of the [[First Crusade]], reports that the [[troubadour]]s used the term ''Bafomet'' for the [[Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and called the [[mosque]]s ''Bafumarias''.<ref>\"Raimundus de Agiles says of the Mahometans: In ecclesiis autem magnis '''Bafumarias''' faciebant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. habebant monticulum ubi du\u00e6 erant '''Bafumari\u00e6'''.

Over 100&nbsp;different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], [[Homosexuality in medieval Europe|homosexual relations]], spitting and urinating on the cross, and [[sodomy]].<ref name=Stahuljak2/> Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the [[Catharism|Cathars]]<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=204}}</ref> and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and charged him with near identical offenses. Yet [[Malcolm Barber]] observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\".<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=306}}</ref> The \"[[Chinon Parchment]] suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross,\" says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the [[Saracen]]s, where they were taught how to commit [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] \"with the mind only and not with the heart\".<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|2005|p=138}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Haag<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Haag |title=Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's temple to the Freemasons |publisher=Profile Books |year=2009}}</ref> suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation ritual.\n\n{{quote| The indictment (acte d'accusation) published by the court of Rome set forth ... \"that in all the provinces they had idols, that is to say, heads, some of which had three faces, others but one; sometimes, it was a human skull ...

It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[socialism]], or [[Utopian socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. L\u00e9vi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

For six years and more I had tried to discover the proper way to spell this name. I knew that it must have eight letters, and also that the numerical and literal correspondences must be such as to express the meaning of the name in such a way as to confirm what scholarship had found out about it, and also to clear up those problems which archaeologists had so far failed to solve&nbsp;... One theory of the name is that it represents the words \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2, the baptism of wisdom; another, that it is a corruption of a title meaning \"Father Mithras\". Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word \u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series. The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the History of the Knights Templar.\n\nIn the popular [[Personal Computer|PC]] video game ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', in the final mission \"Icon of Sin\", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.\n\nIn July 2015 YouTube star and singer [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]] depicted the deity in the music video for her single \"Lowlife\". Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.\n\nThe 2018 [[Netflix]] series [[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'']] has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. [[The Satanic Temple]] has accused the show of plagiarizing [[Statue of Baphomet|their depiction]] of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2018/11/01/the-satanic-temple-netflixs-sabrina-remake-plagiarized-our-baphomet-statue/|title=The Satanic Temple: Netflix's 'Sabrina' Remake Plagiarized Our Baphomet Statue|last=Atheist|first=Friendly|work=Friendly Atheist|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', in the final mission \"Final Sin\", the Icon of Sin has a resemblance to early depictions of Baphomet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[As above, so below]]\n* [[Beelzebub]]\n* [[Behemoth]]\n* [[History of the Knights Templar]]\n* [[Knights Templar legends]]\n* [[The Magician (Tarot card)|The Magician]]\n* [[Mahound]]\n* [[Medieval Christian views on Muhammad]]\n* [[Pazuzu]]\n* [[Termagant]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Barber |year=1994 |title=The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42041-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|year=2006 |title= The Trial of the Templars|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67236-8|edition=2nd|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Malcolm|last2=Bate|first2=Keith|title= Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th-13th Centuries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-6356-0|year=2010|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Budge|first=Ernest Alfred Wallis|title= The Gods of the Egyptians: or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|year=1904|publisher=Methuen & Co|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ|volume=II volumes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/eoftg/index.html|year=1974|title=The Equinox of the Gods|location=New York|publisher=Gordon Press}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Ordo Templi Orientis\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| title = The Book of Thoth; A Short Essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, being the Equinox, Volume III, No. V\n| location = London\n| year = 1944\n| title-link = The Book of Thoth (Crowley)\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Thelema Media\n| isbn = 978-0-9726583-8-6\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| editor = Louis Wilkinson\n| title = The Law is for All: The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis sub figura CCXX, The Book of the Law\n| date = December 1996\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Samuel Weiser\n| isbn = 978-0-87728-919-7\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| first2 = Mary|last2=Desti\n| author3-link = Leila Waddell\n| first3 = Leila|last3=Waddell\n| editor = [[William Breeze|Hymenaeus.

The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order. This view was also taken by a succession of German scholars, in England by C. G. Addison, and in France by a whole series of conspicuous writers: ''e.g.'' Mignet, Guizot, Renan, Lavocat. Others, like Boutaric, while rejecting the charge of heresy, accepted the evidence for the ''spuitio'' and the indecent kisses, explaining the former as a formula of forgotten meaning and the latter as a sign of ''fraternit\u00e9!''{{-\"}} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911.</ref>\n\nSince 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with the \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by [[\u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi]],<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/><ref name=Waite/> which contains binary elements representing the \"[[Symbol|symbolization]] of the equilibrium of opposites\"<ref name=Strube/> (e.g. [[Human\u2013animal hybrid|half-human and half-animal]], [[Androgyny|male and female]], [[good and evil]], on and off, etc.).<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> On one hand, L\u00e9vi's intention was to symbolize his concept of balance that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light;<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a tradition that should result in a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/>\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Baphomet'' appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the [[Crusades|crusader]] Anselm of Ribemont:\n{|\n|\n{{quote|''Sequenti die aurora apparente, altis vocibus '''Baphometh''' invocaverunt; et nos Deum nostrum in cordibus nostris deprecantes, impetum facientes in eos, de muris civitatis omnes expulimus.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cIUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT142 |title=Godefridi Bullonii epistolae et diplomata; accedunt appendices |first=Godfrey |last=Bullonii (of Bouillon) |date=30 March 2018 |via=Google Books}}</ref>}}\n|\n{{quote|As the next day dawned, they called loudly upon '''Baphometh'''; and we prayed silently in our hearts to God, then we attacked and forced all of them outside the city walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|Bate|2010|p=29}}</ref>}}\n|}\n[[Raymond of Aguilers]], a chronicler of the [[First Crusade]], reports that the [[troubadour]]s used the term ''Bafomet'' for the [[Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and called the [[mosque]]s ''Bafumarias''.<ref>\"Raimundus de Agiles says of the Mahometans: In ecclesiis autem magnis '''Bafumarias''' faciebant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. habebant monticulum ubi du\u00e6 erant '''Bafumari\u00e6'''.

[[\u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi]] published ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (\"Dogma and Rituals of High Magic\") as two volumes (''Dogme'' 1854, ''Rituel'' 1856), in which he included an image he had drawn himself which he described as Baphomet and \"The Sabbatic Goat\", showing a winged humanoid goat with a pair of breasts and a torch on its head between its horns (''illustration, top'').

This sign expresses the perfect harmony of mercy with justice. His one arm is female, the other male like the ones of the androgyne of Khunrath, the attributes of which we had to unite with those of our goat because he is one and the same symbol. The flame of intelligence shining between his horns is the magic light of the universal balance, the image of the soul elevated above matter, as the flame, whilst being tied to matter, shines above it. The beast's head expresses the horror of the sinner, whose materially acting, solely responsible part has to bear the punishment exclusively; because the soul is insensitive according to its nature and can only suffer when it materializes. The rod standing instead of genitals symbolizes eternal life, the body covered with scales the water, the semi-circle above it the atmosphere, the feathers following above the volatile.

It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[socialism]], or [[Utopian socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. L\u00e9vi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series. The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the History of the Knights Templar.\n\nIn the popular [[Personal Computer|PC]] video game ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', in the final mission \"Icon of Sin\", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.\n\nIn July 2015 YouTube star and singer [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]] depicted the deity in the music video for her single \"Lowlife\". Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.\n\nThe 2018 [[Netflix]] series [[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'']] has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. [[The Satanic Temple]] has accused the show of plagiarizing [[Statue of Baphomet|their depiction]] of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2018/11/01/the-satanic-temple-netflixs-sabrina-remake-plagiarized-our-baphomet-statue/|title=The Satanic Temple: Netflix's 'Sabrina' Remake Plagiarized Our Baphomet Statue|last=Atheist|first=Friendly|work=Friendly Atheist|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', in the final mission \"Final Sin\", the Icon of Sin has a resemblance to early depictions of Baphomet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[As above, so below]]\n* [[Beelzebub]]\n* [[Behemoth]]\n* [[History of the Knights Templar]]\n* [[Knights Templar legends]]\n* [[The Magician (Tarot card)|The Magician]]\n* [[Mahound]]\n* [[Medieval Christian views on Muhammad]]\n* [[Pazuzu]]\n* [[Termagant]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Barber |year=1994 |title=The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42041-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|year=2006 |title= The Trial of the Templars|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67236-8|edition=2nd|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Malcolm|last2=Bate|first2=Keith|title= Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th-13th Centuries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-6356-0|year=2010|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Budge|first=Ernest Alfred Wallis|title= The Gods of the Egyptians: or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|year=1904|publisher=Methuen & Co|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ|volume=II volumes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/eoftg/index.html|year=1974|title=The Equinox of the Gods|location=New York|publisher=Gordon Press}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Ordo Templi Orientis\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| title = The Book of Thoth; A Short Essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, being the Equinox, Volume III, No. V\n| location = London\n| year = 1944\n| title-link = The Book of Thoth (Crowley)\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Thelema Media\n| isbn = 978-0-9726583-8-6\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| editor = Louis Wilkinson\n| title = The Law is for All: The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis sub figura CCXX, The Book of the Law\n| date = December 1996\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Samuel Weiser\n| isbn = 978-0-87728-919-7\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| first2 = Mary|last2=Desti\n| author3-link = Leila Waddell\n| first3 = Leila|last3=Waddell\n| editor = [[William Breeze|Hymenaeus.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals.

''TalkinBroadway.com'', June 17, 2009.</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile relocated to [[Buffalo, New York]], the musical closely follows the film.\n\n=== Act I ===\nIn depressed Buffalo, New York, the once-successful [[steel mill]]s have grown brown with rust, rolling equipment has been removed, and the lines are silent. Best friends Jerry Lukowski and Dave Bukatinsky, along with the other unemployed mill workers, collect [[unemployment]] checks and ponder their lost lives, describing themselves as \"Scrap\". Elsewhere, Dave's wife Georgie and her friends are celebrating a night on the town by attending a [[Chippendales]] performance.  With their newfound independence and wealth as the sole earners of their families, they declare \"It's a Woman's World\".\n\nWhile hiding in the bathroom of the strip club, Jerry and Dave hear how unhappy Georgie is over Dave's insecurities (in part because of his weight) and Pam, Jerry's ex-wife, laments the loss of her marriage and her plans to take court action against him for the child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Compromising the situation further is Jerry's son, Nathan, who reluctantly spends time with him; he has grown tired of his father's seeming lack of motivation.\n\nAfter talking to the stripper in the Chippendales act, Jerry and Dave are intrigued by the women's willingness to pay for a striptease act. Jerry is convinced that his ship has finally come in: he decides to organize a similar act of his own, with the intent to earn enough money to pay for his child support obligations (\"Man\").\n\nThe first to join the act is gauche and lonely Malcolm, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Jerry once worked. Malcolm tries to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself in his car through carbon monoxide poisoning. Dave pulls him out, and Jerry and Dave discuss various methods to commit suicide, for example: \"A Big-Ass Rock\".  Malcolm ultimately joins in and with the reassurance of his new-found friends behind him, he joins the fledgling lineup. His rescue and inclusion in the group gives him a newly optimistic and confident outlook on life. He also starts to grow more independent from his domineering, invalid mother, Molly.\n\nNext on Dave and Jerry's list is their former foreman, the middle-class aspirant Harold Nichols, who is taking a [[ballroom dance]] class with his immaculately groomed wife, Vicki. While Harold explains that he has concealed his unemployment from his materialistic wife, Vicki blithely sings about her sweet \"Life with Harold\".  Dave and Jerry tell him of their scheme; with literally no options left, Harold agrees to be the act's [[choreographer]].\n\nIn a sequence of scenes, former co-workers perform strip-tease auditions. One of the auditionees is invited to sit down after he flunks; he declines, saying that his children are outside waiting 'in the car' and that 'this is no place for kids' before glancing over at Nathan before leaving. Other auditioners are, however, hired: Noah 'Horse' Simmons for his comprehensive dance knowledge (while overlooking evidence of advanced arthritis) and urban legend, that is, the \"Big Black Man\"; and Ethan Girard, who longs to dance like [[Donald O'Connor]] in \"[[Singin' in the Rain]]\" and has a jaw-dropping, euphemism-inducing penis.  They are also joined by Jeanette Burmeister, a tough, seen-it-all showbiz musician who \"shows up, piano and all\" to accompany the boys' rehearsals.\n\nElsewhere, Dave contemplates his weight and Harold contemplates Vicki's spending habits, commenting they \"Rule My World\". At the first rehearsal, Harold feels the men are hopeless, but Jerry fires them up, encouraging them to think of it not as dance, but as sports moves ([[Michael Jordan]]'s Ball).\n\n=== Act II ===\nAs the men practice, doubts continue to creep in about whether this is the best way to make some money, due to their individual insecurities over their appearances. Jeanette is particularly straightforward (\"Jeanette's Showbiz Number\").\n\nRequiring a deposit at the club, Jerry tries to get seed money from Pam, which she denies.  Nathan eventually provides some college funds, and Jerry is moved by Nathan's growing belief in his father (\"Breeze Off the River\").\n\nLater, as the men are rehearsing at Harold's house, they undress in front of each other for the first time, and have nightmare visions that the women of the town will find \"The Goods\" will be inadequate. They are interrupted by repossessors who are scared off by the scantily clad men; their mutual friendships continue to grow.\n\nDuring a dress rehearsal, the boys get literally caught with their pants down  wearing [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], causing  Jerry, Horse, Harold, Jeanette, and Nathan to be brought into a police station. Malcolm and Ethan successfully escape, and fall into a [[homoerotic]] embrace after they climb through the window of Malcolm's house. They are interrupted by the sudden illness of Molly.\n\nAfter Pam tearfully picks up Nathan (\"Man, reprise\"), the men are approached on the street by local women acquaintances who have heard of their show. Jerry declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they'll go \"[[The Full Monty (phrase)|the full monty]]\"\u2014strip all the way. Dave, meanwhile, quits less than a week before the show, deprecating himself as a 'fat bastard' whom no one would want to see in the nude\u2014including his wife, Georgie.\n\nThe boys are brought together at the [[funeral]] of Malcolm's mother, where he is joined by Ethan in subtly announcing their relationship\u2014\"You Walk with Me\".\n\nTheir secret out, all seems lost for the members of Hot Metal\u2014their \"stage name\". But Georgie and Vicki reconfirm their love for their husbands despite their failures (\"You Rule My World, reprise\"). It is also revealed the arrest publicity has spiked ticket sales.\n\nWith not much left to lose, and a sold-out show, the men decide to go for it for one night, including Harold, who has finally gotten a job. Dave finds his confidence and joins the rest of the group, but Jerry has a last minute loss of his.  Nathan convinces him to go on and he joins the boys for the final performance.

''TalkinBroadway.com'', June 17, 2009.</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile relocated to [[Buffalo, New York]], the musical closely follows the film.\n\n=== Act I ===\nIn depressed Buffalo, New York, the once-successful [[steel mill]]s have grown brown with rust, rolling equipment has been removed, and the lines are silent. Best friends Jerry Lukowski and Dave Bukatinsky, along with the other unemployed mill workers, collect [[unemployment]] checks and ponder their lost lives, describing themselves as \"Scrap\". Elsewhere, Dave's wife Georgie and her friends are celebrating a night on the town by attending a [[Chippendales]] performance.  With their newfound independence and wealth as the sole earners of their families, they declare \"It's a Woman's World\".\n\nWhile hiding in the bathroom of the strip club, Jerry and Dave hear how unhappy Georgie is over Dave's insecurities (in part because of his weight) and Pam, Jerry's ex-wife, laments the loss of her marriage and her plans to take court action against him for the child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Compromising the situation further is Jerry's son, Nathan, who reluctantly spends time with him; he has grown tired of his father's seeming lack of motivation.\n\nAfter talking to the stripper in the Chippendales act, Jerry and Dave are intrigued by the women's willingness to pay for a striptease act. Jerry is convinced that his ship has finally come in: he decides to organize a similar act of his own, with the intent to earn enough money to pay for his child support obligations (\"Man\").\n\nThe first to join the act is gauche and lonely Malcolm, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Jerry once worked. Malcolm tries to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself in his car through carbon monoxide poisoning. Dave pulls him out, and Jerry and Dave discuss various methods to commit suicide, for example: \"A Big-Ass Rock\".  Malcolm ultimately joins in and with the reassurance of his new-found friends behind him, he joins the fledgling lineup. His rescue and inclusion in the group gives him a newly optimistic and confident outlook on life. He also starts to grow more independent from his domineering, invalid mother, Molly.\n\nNext on Dave and Jerry's list is their former foreman, the middle-class aspirant Harold Nichols, who is taking a [[ballroom dance]] class with his immaculately groomed wife, Vicki. While Harold explains that he has concealed his unemployment from his materialistic wife, Vicki blithely sings about her sweet \"Life with Harold\".  Dave and Jerry tell him of their scheme; with literally no options left, Harold agrees to be the act's [[choreographer]].\n\nIn a sequence of scenes, former co-workers perform strip-tease auditions. One of the auditionees is invited to sit down after he flunks; he declines, saying that his children are outside waiting 'in the car' and that 'this is no place for kids' before glancing over at Nathan before leaving. Other auditioners are, however, hired: Noah 'Horse' Simmons for his comprehensive dance knowledge (while overlooking evidence of advanced arthritis) and urban legend, that is, the \"Big Black Man\"; and Ethan Girard, who longs to dance like [[Donald O'Connor]] in \"[[Singin' in the Rain]]\" and has a jaw-dropping, euphemism-inducing penis.  They are also joined by Jeanette Burmeister, a tough, seen-it-all showbiz musician who \"shows up, piano and all\" to accompany the boys' rehearsals.\n\nElsewhere, Dave contemplates his weight and Harold contemplates Vicki's spending habits, commenting they \"Rule My World\". At the first rehearsal, Harold feels the men are hopeless, but Jerry fires them up, encouraging them to think of it not as dance, but as sports moves ([[Michael Jordan]]'s Ball).\n\n=== Act II ===\nAs the men practice, doubts continue to creep in about whether this is the best way to make some money, due to their individual insecurities over their appearances. Jeanette is particularly straightforward (\"Jeanette's Showbiz Number\").\n\nRequiring a deposit at the club, Jerry tries to get seed money from Pam, which she denies.  Nathan eventually provides some college funds, and Jerry is moved by Nathan's growing belief in his father (\"Breeze Off the River\").\n\nLater, as the men are rehearsing at Harold's house, they undress in front of each other for the first time, and have nightmare visions that the women of the town will find \"The Goods\" will be inadequate. They are interrupted by repossessors who are scared off by the scantily clad men; their mutual friendships continue to grow.\n\nDuring a dress rehearsal, the boys get literally caught with their pants down  wearing [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], causing  Jerry, Horse, Harold, Jeanette, and Nathan to be brought into a police station. Malcolm and Ethan successfully escape, and fall into a [[homoerotic]] embrace after they climb through the window of Malcolm's house. They are interrupted by the sudden illness of Molly.\n\nAfter Pam tearfully picks up Nathan (\"Man, reprise\"), the men are approached on the street by local women acquaintances who have heard of their show. Jerry declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they'll go \"[[The Full Monty (phrase)|the full monty]]\"\u2014strip all the way. Dave, meanwhile, quits less than a week before the show, deprecating himself as a 'fat bastard' whom no one would want to see in the nude\u2014including his wife, Georgie.\n\nThe boys are brought together at the [[funeral]] of Malcolm's mother, where he is joined by Ethan in subtly announcing their relationship\u2014\"You Walk with Me\".\n\nTheir secret out, all seems lost for the members of Hot Metal\u2014their \"stage name\". But Georgie and Vicki reconfirm their love for their husbands despite their failures (\"You Rule My World, reprise\").
