Bauer mentions that Biggs 1961 announced a similar finding.</ref>\n\nVowel length is phonemic; but four of the five long vowels occur in only a handful of word roots, the exception being {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}.<ref>Bauer 1997: 536. Bauer even raised the possibility of analysing M\u0101ori as really having six vowel phonemes, ''a, \u0101, e, i, o, u'' ({{IPA|[a, a\u02d0, \u025b, i, \u0254, \u0289]}}).</ref> As noted above, it has recently become standard in M\u0101ori spelling to indicate a long vowel with a macron. For older speakers, long vowels tend to be more peripheral and short vowels more centralised, especially with the low vowel, which is long {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} but short {{IPA|[\u0250]}}. For younger speakers, they are both {{IPA|[a]}}. For older speakers, {{IPA|/u/}} is only fronted after {{IPA|/t/}}; elsewhere it is {{IPA|[u]}}. For younger speakers, it is fronted {{IPA|[\u0289]}} everywhere, as with the corresponding phoneme in [[New Zealand English]].\n\nAs in many other Polynesian languages, diphthongs in M\u0101ori vary only slightly from sequences of adjacent vowels, except that they belong to the same syllable, and all or nearly all sequences of nonidentical vowels are possible. All sequences of nonidentical short vowels occur and are phonemically distinct.<ref>Harlow 1996: 1; Bauer 1997: 534</ref> With younger speakers, {{IPA|/ai, au/}} start with a higher vowel than the {{IPA|[a]}} of {{IPA|/ae, ao/}}.\n\nThe following table shows the five vowel phonemes and the allophones for some of them according to Bauer 1997 and Harlow 2006. Some of these phonemes occupy large spaces in the anatomical [[vowel triangle]] (actually a trapezoid) of tongue positions. For example, as above, {{IPA|/u/}} is sometimes realised as {{IPA|[\u0289]}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Central vowel|Central]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|i}} {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} \n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" |{{angbr|u}} {{IPA|[\u0289]}}, {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} \n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|e}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|o}} {{IPA|[\u0254]}}, {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} \n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" |{{angbr|a}} {{IPA|[\u0250]}}, {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}<ref>{{IPA|/a/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u0252]}} by many speakers in certain environments, such as between {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[k]}} (Bauer 1993:540) For younger speakers, both are realised as {{IPA|[a]}}.</ref>\n|}\n\nBeside [[monophthong]]s M\u0101ori has many [[diphthong]] vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=69}} [[Formant]] frequency analysis distinguish {{IPA|/a\u012d/, /a\u0115/, /a\u014f/, /a\u016d/, /o\u016d/}} as diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=79}}\n\n=== Consonants ===\n\nThe consonant phonemes of M\u0101ori are listed in the following table. Seven of the ten M\u0101ori [[orthography|consonant letters]] have the same pronunciation as they do in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). For those that do not, the IPA [[phonetic transcription]] is included, enclosed in square brackets per IPA convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''m'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''n'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''ng'''<br /> {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''p'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''k'''\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''wh'''<br />{{IPA|[f, \u0278]}}\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''h'''\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Flap consonant|Tap]]\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''r'''<br />{{IPA|[\u027e]}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''w'''\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\nThe pronunciation of {{angbr|wh}} is extremely variable,<ref>Bauer 1997: 532 lists seven allophones (variant pronunciations).</ref> but its most common pronunciation (its canonical allophone) is the [[Voiceless labiodental fricative|labiodental fricative]], IPA {{IPA|[f]}} (as found in English). Another allophone is the [[bilabial]] fricative, IPA {{IPA|[\u0278]}}, which is usually supposed to be the sole pre-European pronunciation, although linguists are not sure of the truth of this supposition. At least until the 1930s, the bilabial fricative was considered to be the correct pronunciation.<ref>Williams, H. W. and W. L (1930). ''First Lessons in Maori''. Whitcombe and Tombs Limited. p. 6.</ref> The fact that English {{angbr|f}} gets substituted by {{angbr|p}} and not {{angbr|wh}} in borrowings (for example, English ''February'' becomes ''P\u0113puere'' instead of *''Wh\u0113puere'') would strongly hint that the M\u0101ori did not perceive English {{IPA|/f/}} to be the same sound as their {{angbr|wh}}.\n\nBecause English stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} primarily have aspiration, speakers of English often hear the M\u0101ori nonaspirated stops as English {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}. However, younger M\u0101ori speakers tend to aspirate {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} as in English. English speakers also tend to hear M\u0101ori {{IPA|/r/}} as English {{IPA|/l/}} in certain positions (cf. [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers|Japanese]] r). These ways of hearing have given rise to place-name spellings which are incorrect in M\u0101ori, like [[Tolaga Bay]] in the North Island and [[Otago]] and [[Waihola]] in the South Island.\n{{IPA|/t/}} becomes an affricate {{IPA|[[Voiceless alveolar affricate|ts]]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} in modern M\u0101ori.\n\n{{IPA|/\u014b/}} can come at the beginning of a word (like ''sing-along'' without the \"si\"), which is difficult for English speakers outside of New Zealand to manage.\n\n{{IPA|/h/}} is pronounced as a glottal stop, {{IPAblink|\u0294}}, and the sound of {{angbr|wh}} as {{IPA|[\u0294w]}}, in some western areas of North Island.\n\n{{IPA|/\u027e/}} is typically a [[alveolar flap|flap]], especially before {{IPA|/a/}}. However, elsewhere it is sometimes [[alveolar trill|trilled]].\n\nIn borrowings from English, many consonants are substituted by the nearest available M\u0101ori consonant. For example, the English fricatives {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} are replaced by {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/f/}} becomes {{IPA|/p}}/, and {{IPA|/l/}} becomes {{IPA|/\u027e/}} (the {{IPA|/l/}} is sometimes retained in the southern dialect, as noted below).\n\n=== Syllables and phonotactics ===\n[[Syllable]]s in M\u0101ori have one of the following forms: '''V, VV, CV, CVV'''. This set of four can be summarised by the notation, '''(C)V(V)''', in which the segments in parentheses may or may not be present. A syllable cannot begin with two consonant sounds (the '''[[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]''' ''ng'' and ''wh'' represent single consonant '''sounds'''), and cannot end in a consonant, although some speakers may occasionally devoice a final vowel. All possible '''CV''' combinations are grammatical, though ''wo'', ''who'', ''wu'', and ''whu'' occur only in a few loanwords from English such as ''wuru'', \"wool\" and ''whutuporo'', \"football\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MaoriLanguage/Pronunciation/en |title=MAORI LANGUAGE \u2013 Pronunciation |year=1966 |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=A.

For example, \"Presbyterian\" has been borrowed as ''Perehipeteriana''; no consonant position in the loanword has been deleted, but /s/ and /b/ have been replaced with /h/ and /p/, respectively.\n\nStress is typically within the last four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four moras. However, stressed moras are longer than unstressed moras, so the word does not have the precision in M\u0101ori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.\n\n== Dialects ==\n[[File:M\u0101ori dialects map.svg|thumb|North Island dialects<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harlow|first1=Ray|title=M\u0101ori, A Linguistic Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107407626|page=42}}</ref>]]\nBiggs proposed that historically there were two major dialect groups, North Island and South Island, and that South Island M\u0101ori is extinct.<ref>Biggs 1988: 65</ref> Biggs has analysed North Island M\u0101ori as comprising a western group and an eastern group with the boundary between them running pretty much along the island's north\u2013south axis.<ref>Bauer 1997: xxvi</ref>\n\nWithin these broad divisions regional variations occur, and individual regions show tribal variations. The major differences occur in the pronunciation of words, variation of vocabulary, and idiom. A fluent speaker of M\u0101ori has no problem understanding other dialects.\n\nThere is no significant variation in grammar between dialects. \"Most of the tribal variation in grammar is a matter of preferences: speakers of one area might prefer one grammatical form to another, but are likely on occasion to use the non-preferred form, and at least to recognise and understand it.\"<ref>Bauer 1993: xxi\u2013xxii</ref> Vocabulary and pronunciation vary to a greater extent, but this does not pose barriers to communication.\n\n=== North Island dialects ===\nIn the southwest of the island, in the [[Whanganui]] and [[Taranaki]] regions, the phoneme /h/ is a [[glottal stop]] and the phoneme /wh/ is [\u0294w]. This difference was the subject of considerable debate during the 1990s and 2000s over the then-proposed change of the name of the city Wanganui to Whanganui.\n\nIn [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe|T\u016bhoe]] and the Eastern [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] (northeastern North Island) ''ng'' has merged with ''n''. In parts of the Far North, ''wh'' has merged with ''w''.\n\n=== South Island dialects ===\nIn the extinct South Island dialects, ''ng'' merged with ''k'' in many regions. Thus ''K\u0101i Tahu'' and ''[[Ng\u0101i Tahu]]'' are variations in the name of the same [[iwi]] (the latter form is the one used in acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing ''ng'' with ''k''. New Zealand's highest mountain, known for centuries as ''Aoraki'' in southern M\u0101ori dialects that merge ''ng'' with ''k'', and as ''Aorangi'' by other M\u0101ori, was later named \"Mount Cook\", in honour of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]. Now its sole official name is ''[[Aoraki/Mount Cook]]'', which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the M\u0101ori name for [[Stewart Island]], ''Rakiura'', is cognate with the name of the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] town of [[Rangiora]]. Likewise, [[Dunedin]]'s main research library, the [[Hocken Collections]], has the name ''Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena'' rather than the northern (standard) ''Te Whare Taonga o H\u0101kena''.<ref>The Hocken Library contains several early journals and notebooks of early missionaries documenting the vagaries of the southern dialect. Several of them are shown at Blackman, A. \"[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/thehockenblog/2011/07/07/some-sources-for-southern-maori-dialect/ Some Sources for Southern Maori dialect]\", Hocken Library, 7 July 2001. Retrieved 3 December 2014.</ref> Maarire Goodall and [[George Griffiths (historian)|Griffiths]] say there is also a voicing of ''k'' to ''g'' \u2013 this is why the region of [[Otago]] (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after \u2013 [[Otakou]] (standard M\u0101ori) \u2013 vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) pp. 46\u20138.</ref> Westland's [[Waitangitaona River]] became two distinct rivers after an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]], each named in a differing dialect. While the northern river was named the ''Waitangit\u0101huna River'', the southern river became the ''Waitakit\u0101huna-ki-te-Toka'', using the more usual southern spelling (''ki-te-Toka'', \"of the south\", would be rendered ''ki-te-Tonga'' in standard M\u0101ori).\n\nThe standard M\u0101ori ''r'' is also found occasionally changed to an ''l'' in these southern dialects and the ''wh'' to ''w''. These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as [[Lake Waihola]]<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) p. 50: ''Southern dialect for 'wai' \u2013 water, 'hora' \u2013 spread out.''</ref> and the nearby coastal settlement of [[Wangaloa]] (which would, in standard M\u0101ori, be rendered ''Whangaroa''), and [[Little Akaloa]], on [[Banks Peninsula]]. Goodall and Griffiths claim that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as [[schwa]] or that they are [[Elision|elided]] (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly-bastardised place names as [[The Kilmog]], which in standard M\u0101ori would have been rendered ''Kirimoko'', but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced very much as the current name suggests.<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) p. 45: ''This hill <nowiki>[The Kilmog]</nowiki>...has a much debated name, but its origins are clear to Kaitahu and the word illustrates several major features of the southern dialect. First we must restore the truncated final vowel (in this case to both parts of the name, 'kilimogo'). Then substitute r for l, k for g, to obtain the northern pronunciation, 'kirimoko'.... Though final vowels existed in Kaitahu dialect, the elision was so nearly complete that [[p\u0101keh\u0101]] recorders often omitted them entirely.''</ref> This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, ''kainga'' in standard M\u0101ori), near [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] and [[Akaroa]], and the early spelling of [[Lake Wakatipu]] as ''Wagadib''. In standard M\u0101ori, Wakatipu would have been rendered ''Whakatipua'', showing further the elision of a final vowel.\n\nDespite being officially regarded as extinct,<ref>As with many \"dead\" languages, there is a possibility that the southern dialect may be revived, especially with the encouragement mentioned. \"The [[Murihiku]] language \u2013 Mulihig' being probably better expressive of its state in 1844 \u2013 lives on in Watkin's vocabulary list and in many [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbirding]] terms still in use, and may flourish again in the new climate of [[Maoritanga|Maoritaka]].\" (Natusch, S.

The personal pronouns have a distinction in [[clusivity]], singular, dual and plural numbers,<ref>Biggs 1998: 32-33</ref> and the genitive pronouns have different classes (''a'' class, ''o'' class and neutral) according to whether the possession is [[Alienable and inalienable possession|alienable]] or the possessor has control of the relationship (''a'' category), or the possession is [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] or the possessor has no control over the relationship (''o'' category), and a third [[Possessive determiner|neutral class]] that only occurs for singular pronouns and must be followed by a noun.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\">Biggs 1998: 46-48</ref>\n\n=== Bases ===\nBiggs (1998) developed an analysis that the basic unit of M\u0101ori speech is the phrase rather than the word.<ref>Biggs 1998: 3</ref> The lexical word forms the \"base\" of the phrase. \"Nouns\" include those bases that can take a definite article, but cannot occur as the nucleus of a verbal phrase; for example: ''ika'' (fish) or ''r\u0101kau'' (tree).<ref>Biggs 1998: 54-55</ref> Plurality is marked by various means, including the definite article (singular ''te'', plural ''ng\u0101''),<ref>Bauer 1997: 144-147</ref> deictic particles \"t\u0113r\u0101 r\u0101kau\" (that tree), \"\u0113r\u0101 r\u0101kau\" (those trees),<ref>Bauer 1997: 153-154</ref> possessives \"taku whare\" (my house), \"aku whare\" (my houses).<ref>Bauer 1997: 394-396</ref> A few nouns lengthen a vowel in the plural, such as ''wahine'' (woman); ''w\u0101hine'' (women).<ref>Bauer 1997: 160</ref> In general, bases used as qualifiers follow the base they qualify, e.g. \"matua wahine\" (mother, female elder) from \"matua\" (parent, elder) \"wahine\" (woman).<ref>Biggs 1998: 153</ref>\n\nStatives serve as bases usable as verbs but not available for passive use, such as ''ora'', alive or ''tika'', correct.<ref>Biggs 1998: 55</ref> Grammars generally refer to them as \"stative verbs\". When used in sentences, statives require different syntax than other verb-like bases.<ref>Biggs 1998: 23-24</ref>\n\n'''Locative bases''' can follow the locative particle ''ki'' (to, towards) directly, such as ''runga'', above, ''waho'', outside, and placenames (''ki Tamaki'', to Auckland).<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 57\">Biggs 1998: 57</ref>\n\n'''Personal''' bases take the personal article ''a'' after ''ki'', such as names of people (''ki a Hohepa'', to Joseph), personified houses, personal pronouns, ''wai?'' who? and ''Mea'', so-and-so.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 57\"/>\n\n=== Particles ===\nLike all other Polynesian languages, M\u0101ori has a rich array of particles, which include verbal particles, pronouns, locative particles, articles and possessives.\n\nVerbal particles indicate aspectual, tense related or modal properties of the verb to which they relate to. They include:\n\n* ''i'' (past)\n* ''e'' (non-past)\n* ''kei te'' (present continuous)\n* ''kua'' (perfect)\n* ''e ... ana'' (imperfect, continuous)\n* ''ka'' (inceptive, future)\n* ''kia'' (desiderative)\n* ''me'' (prescriptive)\n* ''kei'' (warning, \"lest\")\n* ''ina'' or ''ana'' (punctative-conditional, \"if and when\")<ref>Bauer 1997: 84-100</ref>\n* ''k\u0101ti'' (cessative)<ref>Bauer 1997: 447</ref>\n*''ai'' (habitual)<ref>Bauer 1997: 98</ref>\n\nLocative particles (prepositions) refer to position in time and/or space, and include:\n\n*''ki'' (to, towards)\n*''kei'' (at)\n*''i'' (past position)\n*''hei'' (future position)<ref>Bauer 1997: 30</ref>\n\nPossessives fall into one of two classes of prepositions marked by ''a'' and ''o'', depending on the dominant versus subordinate relationship between possessor and possessed: ''ng\u0101 tamariki a te matua'', the children of the parent but ''te matua o ng\u0101 tamariki'', the parent of the children.<ref>Biggs 1998: 42</ref>\n\n=== Articles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!'''Definite'''\n|      ''te''\n|  ''ng\u0101''\n|-\n!'''Indefinite'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |            ''he''\n|-\n!'''Proper'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |            ''a''\n|}\n\nDefinitives include the articles ''te'' (singular) and ''ng\u0101'' (plural)<ref>Biggs 1998: 7-8</ref> and the possessive prepositions ''t\u0101'' and ''t\u014d''.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\"/> These also combine with the pronouns.\n\nThe indefinite article ''he'' is usually positioned at the beginning of the phrase in which it is used. The indefinite article is used when the base is used indefinitely or nominally. These phrases can be identified as an indefinite nominal phrase. The article either can be translated to the English \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018some\u2019, but the number will not be indicated by ''he.'' The indefinite article ''he'' when used with mass nouns like water and sand will always mean 'some'.<ref>Biggs 1998: 7</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''He t\u0101ne''\n|A man\n|Some men\n|-\n|''He k\u014dtiro''\n|A girl\n|Some girls\n|-\n|''He k\u0101inga''\n|A village\n|Some villages\n|-\n|''He \u0101poro''\n|An apple\n|Some apples\n|}\nThe proper article ''a'' is used for personal nouns. The personal nouns do not have the definite or indefinite articles on the proper article unless it is an important part of its name.

Other definitives include ''t\u0113hea?'' (which?), and ''t\u0113tahi'', (a certain). The plural is formed just by dropping the ''t'': ''t\u0113nei'' (this), ''\u0113nei'' (these). The related adverbs are ''nei'' (here), ''n\u0101'' (there, near you)'', r\u0101'' (over there, near him).<ref>Bauer 1997: 152-154</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Adverb\n|-\n!Proximal\n|''t\u0113nei''\n|''\u0113nei''\n|''nei''\n|-\n!Medial\n|''t\u0113n\u0101''\n|''\u0113n\u0101''\n|''n\u0101''\n|-\n!Distal\n|''t\u0113r\u0101''\n|''\u0113r\u0101''\n|''r\u0101''\n|}\n\n=== Pronouns ===\n\n==== Personal pronouns ====\nPronouns have singular, dual and plural number.

For example: ''ia'' (he/she), ''r\u0101ua'' (they two), ''r\u0101tou'' (they, three or more). M\u0101ori pronouns and possessives further distinguish exclusive \"we\" from inclusive \"we\", second and third. It has the plural pronouns: ''m\u0101tou'' (we, exc), ''t\u0101tou'' (we, inc), ''koutou'' (you), ''r\u0101tou'' (they). The language features the dual pronouns: ''m\u0101ua'' (we two, exc), ''t\u0101ua'' (we two, inc), ''k\u014drua'' (you two), ''r\u0101ua'' (they two). The difference between [[Clusivity|exclusive and inclusive]] lies in the treatment of the person addressed. ''M\u0101tou'' refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (\"I and some others but not you\"), and ''t\u0101tou'' refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to and everyone else (\"you, I and others\"):<ref>Bauer 1997: 261-262</ref>\n\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 koe'': hello (to one person)\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 k\u014drua'': hello (to two people)\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 koutou'': hello (to more than two people)<ref>''[http://www.maorilanguage.net/maori-words-phrases/greetings-mihi/ Greetings - Mihi]'', M\u0101oriLanguage.net, Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n==== Possessive pronouns ====\nThe possessive pronouns vary according to person, number, clusivity, and possessive class (a class or o class). Example: t\u0101ku pene (my pen), \u0101ku pene (my pens). For dual and plural subject pronouns, the possessive form is analytical, by just putting the possessive particle ('''t\u0101/t\u014d''' for singular objects or '''\u0101/\u014d''' for plural objects) before the personal pronouns, e.g. ''t\u0101 t\u0101tou karaihe'' (our class), ''t\u014d r\u0101ua whare'' (their [dual] house); ''\u0101 t\u0101tou karaihe'' (our classes). The neuter one must be followed by a noun and only occur for singular first, second and third persons. ''Taku'' is my, ''aku'' is my (plural, for many possessed items). The plural is made by deleting the initial [t].<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Singular\n! colspan=\"3\" |Plural\n|-\n!Number\n!Person\n!a class\n!o class\n!neutral\n!a class\n!o class\n!neutral\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Singular\n!1\n|t\u0101ku\n|t\u014dku\n|taku\n|\u0101ku\n|\u014dku\n|aku\n|-\n!2\n|t\u0101u\n|t\u014du\n|t\u014d\n|\u0101u\n|\u014du\n|\u014d\n|-\n!3\n|t\u0101na\n|t\u014dna\n|tana\n|\u0101na\n|\u014dna\n|ana\n|}\n\n==== Interrogative pronouns ====\n* ''wai'' ('who')\n* ''aha'' ('what')\n* ''hea'' ('where')\n* ''n\u014d hea'' ('whence')\n* ''\u0101hea'' ('when')\n* ''e hia'' ('how many [things]')\n* ''tokohia'' ('how many [people]')\n* ''p\u0113hea'' ('how')\n* ''t\u0113hea'' ('which'), \u0113hea ('which [pl.]')\n* ''he aha ... ai'' ('why [reason]')\n* ''n\u0101 te aha ... ai'' ('why [cause]')<ref>''[https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/questions Questions]'', Kupu o te R\u0101, Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n=== Phrase grammar ===\nA phrase spoken in M\u0101ori can be broken up into two parts: the \u201cnucleus\u201d or \"head\" and \u201cperiphery\u201d (modifiers, determiners). The nucleus can be thought of as the meaning and is the centre of the phrase, whereas the periphery is where the grammatical meaning is conveyed and occurs before and/or after the nucleus.<ref>Biggs 1998: 4</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Periphery'''\n|'''Nucleus'''\n|'''Periphery'''\n|-\n|''te''\n|''whare''\n|''nei''\n|-\n|''ki te''\n|''whare''\n|\n|}\n\nThe nucleus ''whare'' can be translated as \"house\", the periphery ''te'' is similar to an article \"the\" and the periphery ''nei'' indicates proximity to the speaker. The whole phrase, ''te whare nei'', can then be translated as \"this house\".<ref>Biggs 1998: 5</ref>\n\n==== Phrasal particles ====\nA definite and declarative sentence (may be a copulative sentence) begins with the declarative particle ''ko''.<ref>Biggs 1998: 15-17</ref> If the sentence is topicalized (agent topic, only in non-present sentences) the particle '''''n\u0101''''' begins the sentence (past tense) or the '''''m\u0101''''' (future, imperfective) followed by the agent/subject. In these cases the word order changes to SVO. These agent topicalizing particles can contract with singular personal pronouns and vary according to the possessive classes: ''n\u0101ku'' can be though of as meaning \"as for me\" and behave like an emphatic or dative pronoun.<ref>Biggs 1998: 87-89</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agent topic pronouns\n!\n!Past\n!Future\n|-\n!1S\n|n\u0101ku/n\u014dku\n|m\u0101ku/m\u014dku\n|-\n!2S\n|n\u0101u/n\u014du\n|m\u0101u/m\u014d\n|-\n!3S\n|n\u0101na/n\u014dna\n|m\u0101na/m\u014dna\n|}\n\n==== Case particles ====\n* Nominative: ko<ref>Bauer 1997: 181</ref>\n* Accusative: i<ref>Bauer 1997: 175-176</ref>\n* Dative/directional locative: ki<ref>Bauer 1997: 176-179</ref>\n* Genitive: a/o<ref>Bauer 1997: 183-184</ref>\n\n=== Negation ===\nForming negative phrases in M\u0101ori is quite grammatically complex. There are several different negators which are used under various specific circumstances.<ref name=\":5\">Bauer 2001: 139</ref> The four main negators are as follows:<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Negator\n!Description\n|-\n|''k\u0101o''\n|Negative answer to a polar question.\n|-\n|''k\u0101ore/k\u0101hore/k\u0101re/''\n|The most common verbal negator.\n|-\n|''kore''\n|A strong negator, equivalent to 'never'.\n|-\n|''kaua e''\n|Negative imperatives; prohibitive \n|-\n|''ehara''\n|Negation for copulative phrases, topicalized and equative phrases\n|}\n\n''K\u012bhai'' and ''t\u0113'' are two negators which may be seen in specific dialects or older texts, but are not widely used.<ref name=\":5\" /> The most common negator is ''k\u0101hore'', which may occur in one of four forms, with the ''k\u0101o'' form only being used in response to a question.<ref name=\":5\" /> Negative phrases, besides using ''k\u0101ore,'' also affect the form of verbal particles, as illustrated below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Verbal Particles<ref name=\":5\" />\n!\n!Positive\n!Negative\n|-\n!Past\n|i\n|i\n|-\n!Future\n|ka\n|i/e\n|-\n!Present\n|kei te\n|i te\n|-\n!Imperfect\n| colspan=\"2\" |e...ana\n|-\n!Past perfect\n|kua\n|kia\n|}\n\nThe general usage of ''k\u0101hore'' can be seen in the following examples.

For example, -ia (or just -a if the verb ends in [i]). The other passive suffixes, some of which are very rare, are: -hanga/-hia/-hina/-ina/-kia/-kina/-mia/-na/-nga/-ngia/-ria/-rina/-tia/-whia/-whina/.<ref>Harlow, Ray (2015). ''A M\u0101ori Reference Grammar'', Wellington: Huia, p. 113</ref> The use of the passive suffix -ia is given in this sentence: ''Kua hanga'''ia''' te marae e ng\u0101 tohunga'' (The marae has been built by the experts). The active form of this sentence is rendered as: ''Kua hanga ng\u0101 tohunga i te marae'' (The experts have built the marae). It can seen that the active sentence contains the object marker 'i', that is not present in the passive sentence, while the passive sentence has the agent marker 'e', which is not present in the active sentence.<ref>''[https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/passive-sentences Kupu o te R\u0101: Passive sentences]'', Retrieved 14 September 2019</ref>\n\n=== Polar questions ===\nPolar questions (yes/no questions) can be made by just changing the intonation of the sentence. The answers may be \u0101e (yes) or k\u0101o (no).<ref>Bauer 1997: 424-427</ref>\n\n=== Derivational morphology ===\nAlthough M\u0101ori is mostly analytical there are several derivational affixes:\n\n* -anga, -hanga, -ranga, -tanga (-ness, -ity) (the suffix depends on whether the verb takes, respectively, the -ia, -hia, -ria or -tia passive suffixes) (e.g. ''p\u014dti'' 'vote', ''p\u014dtitanga'' 'election')\n* -nga (nominalizer)<ref>Bauer 1997: 517-524</ref>\n* kai- (agentive noun)<ref>Bauer 1997: 25-26</ref> (e.g. ''mahi'' 'work', ''kaimahi'' 'worker/employee')\n* ma- (adjectives)<ref>Harlow 2015: 112</ref>\n* tua- (ordinal numerals)<ref>Bauer 1997: 282-283</ref> (e.g. ''tahi'' 'one', ''tuatahi'' 'first/primary')\n*whaka- (causative prefix)<ref>Bauer 1997: 44-45</ref> \n\n== Calendar ==\nFrom missionary times, M\u0101ori used adaptations of English names for days of the week and for months of the year. Since about 1990 the M\u0101ori Language Commission has promoted new (\"traditional\") sets. Its days of the week have no pre-European equivalent but reflect the pagan origins of the English names (for example, Hina = moon). The commission based the months of the year on one of the traditional tribal [[lunar calendar]]s.<ref>''[https://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/en/learn/orthographics/ M\u0101ori Orthographic Conventions]'', Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori Language Commission), retrieved 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n{|style=\"background: transparent;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n{|style=\"margin-right: 2em;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5em;\" | Day\n!style=\"width: 8em;\" | Adaptation\n!Official\n|-\n|Monday || Mane || R\u0101hina\n|-\n|Tuesday || T\u016brei || R\u0101t\u016b\n|-\n|Wednesday || Wenerei || R\u0101apa\n|-\n|Thursday || T\u0101ite || R\u0101pare\n|-\n|Friday || Paraire || R\u0101mere\n|-\n|Saturday || R\u0101horoi/H\u0101terei || R\u0101horoi\n|-\n|Sunday || R\u0101tapu/Wiki || R\u0101tapu\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5em;\" | Month\n!style=\"width: 7em;\" | Adaptation\n!Official\n|-\n|January || H\u0101nuere || Kohi-t\u0101tea\n|-\n|February || P\u0113puere || Hui-tanguru\n|-\n|March || M\u0101ehe || Pout\u016b-te-rangi\n|-\n|April || \u0100perira || Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101\n|-\n|May || Mei || Haratua\n|-\n|June || Hune || Pipiri\n|-\n|July || H\u016brae || H\u014dngongoi\n|-\n|August || \u0100kuhata || Here-turi-k\u014dk\u0101\n|-\n|September || Hepetema || Mahuru\n|-\n|October || Oketopa || Whiringa-\u0101-nuku\n|-\n|November || Noema || Whiringa-\u0101-rangi\n|-\n|December || T\u012bhema || Hakihea\n|}\n|}\n\n== Influence on New Zealand English ==\n{{Main|M\u0101ori influence on New Zealand English}}\n[[New Zealand English]] has gained many loanwords from M\u0101ori, mainly the names of birds, plants, fishes and places. For example, the [[kiwi]], the [[national bird]], takes its name from ''te reo''. \"[[Kia ora]]\" (literally \"be healthy\") is a widely adopted greeting of M\u0101ori origin, with the intended meaning of \"hello\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swarbrick|first1=Nancy|title=Manners and social behaviour|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/manners-and-social-behaviour/page-7|website=teara.govt.nz|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en|date=5 September 2013}}</ref> It can also mean \"thank you\", or signify agreement with a speaker at a meeting. The M\u0101ori greetings \"t\u0113n\u0101 koe\" (to one person), \"t\u0113n\u0101 k\u014drua\" (to two people) or \"t\u0113n\u0101 koutou\" (to three or more people) are also widely used, as are farewells such as \"haere r\u0101\". The M\u0101ori phrase \"kia kaha\", \"be strong\", is frequently encountered as an indication of moral support for someone starting a stressful undertaking or otherwise in a difficult situation. Many other words such as \"[[wh\u0101nau]]\" (meaning \"family\") and \"kai\" (meaning \"food\") are also widely understood and used by New Zealanders.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Languages|New Zealand}}\n* [[M\u0101ori Language Week|M\u0101ori Language Week (Te Wiki o te Reo M\u0101ori)]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Banks, Sir Joseph]].

It started this period as the predominant language of New Zealand. In the 1860s, it became a [[minority language]] in the shadow of the English spoken by many settlers, missionaries, gold-seekers, and traders. In the late 19th century, the colonial governments of New Zealand and its provinces introduced an English-style school system for all New Zealanders. From the mid 1800s, due to the [[Native schools|Native Schools]] Act and later the Native Schools Code, the use of M\u0101ori in schools was slowly filtered out of the curriculum in order to become more European.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-3|title=Story: M\u0101ori education \u2013 m\u0101tauranga|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of M\u0101ori people learned English.\n\n=== Decline ===\nUntil the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939\u20131945), most M\u0101ori people spoke M\u0101ori as their first language.

This will ensure that public bodies are compelled to contribute to ''te reo''<nowiki/>'s revival and that key agencies are held properly accountable for the strategies they adopt. For instance, targets for the training of te reo teachers must be met, education curricula involving te reo must be approved, and public bodies in districts with a sufficient number and/or proportion of te reo speakers and schools with a certain proportion of M\u0101ori students must submit M\u0101ori language plans for approval.\n# These regional public bodies and schools must also consult [[iwi]] (M\u0101ori tribes or tribal confederations) in the preparation of their plans.

Some distinctive markings among the ''k\u014dwhaiwhai'' (rafter paintings) of meeting houses were used as mnemonics in reciting ''whakapapa'' (genealogy) but again, there was no systematic relation between marks and meanings.\n\nThe modern M\u0101ori alphabet has 15 letters, two of which are [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: A E H I K M N O P R T U W NG and WH.<ref>An underlined <u>k</u> sometimes appears when writing the Southern dialect, to indicate that the /k/ in question corresponds to the ''ng'' of the standard language. Both L and G are also encountered in the Southern dialect (qv), though not in standard M\u0101ori. Various methods are used to indicate glottal stops when writing the [[Whanganui|Wanganui]] dialect.</ref>  The five vowels have both short and long forms, with the long forms denoted by macrons marked above them - \u0100, \u0112, \u012a, \u014c and \u016a.

Bauer mentions that Biggs 1961 announced a similar finding.</ref>\n\nVowel length is phonemic; but four of the five long vowels occur in only a handful of word roots, the exception being {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}.<ref>Bauer 1997: 536. Bauer even raised the possibility of analysing M\u0101ori as really having six vowel phonemes, ''a, \u0101, e, i, o, u'' ({{IPA|[a, a\u02d0, \u025b, i, \u0254, \u0289]}}).</ref> As noted above, it has recently become standard in M\u0101ori spelling to indicate a long vowel with a macron. For older speakers, long vowels tend to be more peripheral and short vowels more centralised, especially with the low vowel, which is long {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} but short {{IPA|[\u0250]}}. For younger speakers, they are both {{IPA|[a]}}. For older speakers, {{IPA|/u/}} is only fronted after {{IPA|/t/}}; elsewhere it is {{IPA|[u]}}. For younger speakers, it is fronted {{IPA|[\u0289]}} everywhere, as with the corresponding phoneme in [[New Zealand English]].\n\nAs in many other Polynesian languages, diphthongs in M\u0101ori vary only slightly from sequences of adjacent vowels, except that they belong to the same syllable, and all or nearly all sequences of nonidentical vowels are possible. All sequences of nonidentical short vowels occur and are phonemically distinct.<ref>Harlow 1996: 1; Bauer 1997: 534</ref> With younger speakers, {{IPA|/ai, au/}} start with a higher vowel than the {{IPA|[a]}} of {{IPA|/ae, ao/}}.\n\nThe following table shows the five vowel phonemes and the allophones for some of them according to Bauer 1997 and Harlow 2006. Some of these phonemes occupy large spaces in the anatomical [[vowel triangle]] (actually a trapezoid) of tongue positions. For example, as above, {{IPA|/u/}} is sometimes realised as {{IPA|[\u0289]}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Central vowel|Central]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|i}} {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} \n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" |{{angbr|u}} {{IPA|[\u0289]}}, {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} \n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|e}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|{{angbr|o}} {{IPA|[\u0254]}}, {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} \n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" |{{angbr|a}} {{IPA|[\u0250]}}, {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}<ref>{{IPA|/a/}} is realised as {{IPA|[\u0252]}} by many speakers in certain environments, such as between {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[k]}} (Bauer 1993:540) For younger speakers, both are realised as {{IPA|[a]}}.</ref>\n|}\n\nBeside [[monophthong]]s M\u0101ori has many [[diphthong]] vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=69}} [[Formant]] frequency analysis distinguish {{IPA|/a\u012d/, /a\u0115/, /a\u014f/, /a\u016d/, /o\u016d/}} as diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=79}}\n\n=== Consonants ===\n\nThe consonant phonemes of M\u0101ori are listed in the following table. Seven of the ten M\u0101ori [[orthography|consonant letters]] have the same pronunciation as they do in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). For those that do not, the IPA [[phonetic transcription]] is included, enclosed in square brackets per IPA convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''m'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''n'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''ng'''<br /> {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''p'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''k'''\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"| [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''wh'''<br />{{IPA|[f, \u0278]}}\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''h'''\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Flap consonant|Tap]]\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''r'''<br />{{IPA|[\u027e]}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''w'''\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\nThe pronunciation of {{angbr|wh}} is extremely variable,<ref>Bauer 1997: 532 lists seven allophones (variant pronunciations).</ref> but its most common pronunciation (its canonical allophone) is the [[Voiceless labiodental fricative|labiodental fricative]], IPA {{IPA|[f]}} (as found in English). Another allophone is the [[bilabial]] fricative, IPA {{IPA|[\u0278]}}, which is usually supposed to be the sole pre-European pronunciation, although linguists are not sure of the truth of this supposition. At least until the 1930s, the bilabial fricative was considered to be the correct pronunciation.<ref>Williams, H. W. and W. L (1930). ''First Lessons in Maori''. Whitcombe and Tombs Limited. p. 6.</ref> The fact that English {{angbr|f}} gets substituted by {{angbr|p}} and not {{angbr|wh}} in borrowings (for example, English ''February'' becomes ''P\u0113puere'' instead of *''Wh\u0113puere'') would strongly hint that the M\u0101ori did not perceive English {{IPA|/f/}} to be the same sound as their {{angbr|wh}}.\n\nBecause English stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} primarily have aspiration, speakers of English often hear the M\u0101ori nonaspirated stops as English {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}. However, younger M\u0101ori speakers tend to aspirate {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} as in English. English speakers also tend to hear M\u0101ori {{IPA|/r/}} as English {{IPA|/l/}} in certain positions (cf. [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers|Japanese]] r). These ways of hearing have given rise to place-name spellings which are incorrect in M\u0101ori, like [[Tolaga Bay]] in the North Island and [[Otago]] and [[Waihola]] in the South Island.\n{{IPA|/t/}} becomes an affricate {{IPA|[[Voiceless alveolar affricate|ts]]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} in modern M\u0101ori.\n\n{{IPA|/\u014b/}} can come at the beginning of a word (like ''sing-along'' without the \"si\"), which is difficult for English speakers outside of New Zealand to manage.\n\n{{IPA|/h/}} is pronounced as a glottal stop, {{IPAblink|\u0294}}, and the sound of {{angbr|wh}} as {{IPA|[\u0294w]}}, in some western areas of North Island.\n\n{{IPA|/\u027e/}} is typically a [[alveolar flap|flap]], especially before {{IPA|/a/}}. However, elsewhere it is sometimes [[alveolar trill|trilled]].\n\nIn borrowings from English, many consonants are substituted by the nearest available M\u0101ori consonant. For example, the English fricatives {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} are replaced by {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/f/}} becomes {{IPA|/p}}/, and {{IPA|/l/}} becomes {{IPA|/\u027e/}} (the {{IPA|/l/}} is sometimes retained in the southern dialect, as noted below).\n\n=== Syllables and phonotactics ===\n[[Syllable]]s in M\u0101ori have one of the following forms: '''V, VV, CV, CVV'''. This set of four can be summarised by the notation, '''(C)V(V)''', in which the segments in parentheses may or may not be present. A syllable cannot begin with two consonant sounds (the '''[[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]''' ''ng'' and ''wh'' represent single consonant '''sounds'''), and cannot end in a consonant, although some speakers may occasionally devoice a final vowel. All possible '''CV''' combinations are grammatical, though ''wo'', ''who'', ''wu'', and ''whu'' occur only in a few loanwords from English such as ''wuru'', \"wool\" and ''whutuporo'', \"football\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MaoriLanguage/Pronunciation/en |title=MAORI LANGUAGE \u2013 Pronunciation |year=1966 |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=A.

For example, \"Presbyterian\" has been borrowed as ''Perehipeteriana''; no consonant position in the loanword has been deleted, but /s/ and /b/ have been replaced with /h/ and /p/, respectively.\n\nStress is typically within the last four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four moras. However, stressed moras are longer than unstressed moras, so the word does not have the precision in M\u0101ori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.\n\n== Dialects ==\n[[File:M\u0101ori dialects map.svg|thumb|North Island dialects<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harlow|first1=Ray|title=M\u0101ori, A Linguistic Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107407626|page=42}}</ref>]]\nBiggs proposed that historically there were two major dialect groups, North Island and South Island, and that South Island M\u0101ori is extinct.<ref>Biggs 1988: 65</ref> Biggs has analysed North Island M\u0101ori as comprising a western group and an eastern group with the boundary between them running pretty much along the island's north\u2013south axis.<ref>Bauer 1997: xxvi</ref>\n\nWithin these broad divisions regional variations occur, and individual regions show tribal variations. The major differences occur in the pronunciation of words, variation of vocabulary, and idiom. A fluent speaker of M\u0101ori has no problem understanding other dialects.\n\nThere is no significant variation in grammar between dialects. \"Most of the tribal variation in grammar is a matter of preferences: speakers of one area might prefer one grammatical form to another, but are likely on occasion to use the non-preferred form, and at least to recognise and understand it.\"<ref>Bauer 1993: xxi\u2013xxii</ref> Vocabulary and pronunciation vary to a greater extent, but this does not pose barriers to communication.\n\n=== North Island dialects ===\nIn the southwest of the island, in the [[Whanganui]] and [[Taranaki]] regions, the phoneme /h/ is a [[glottal stop]] and the phoneme /wh/ is [\u0294w]. This difference was the subject of considerable debate during the 1990s and 2000s over the then-proposed change of the name of the city Wanganui to Whanganui.\n\nIn [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe|T\u016bhoe]] and the Eastern [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] (northeastern North Island) ''ng'' has merged with ''n''. In parts of the Far North, ''wh'' has merged with ''w''.\n\n=== South Island dialects ===\nIn the extinct South Island dialects, ''ng'' merged with ''k'' in many regions. Thus ''K\u0101i Tahu'' and ''[[Ng\u0101i Tahu]]'' are variations in the name of the same [[iwi]] (the latter form is the one used in acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing ''ng'' with ''k''. New Zealand's highest mountain, known for centuries as ''Aoraki'' in southern M\u0101ori dialects that merge ''ng'' with ''k'', and as ''Aorangi'' by other M\u0101ori, was later named \"Mount Cook\", in honour of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]. Now its sole official name is ''[[Aoraki/Mount Cook]]'', which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the M\u0101ori name for [[Stewart Island]], ''Rakiura'', is cognate with the name of the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] town of [[Rangiora]]. Likewise, [[Dunedin]]'s main research library, the [[Hocken Collections]], has the name ''Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena'' rather than the northern (standard) ''Te Whare Taonga o H\u0101kena''.<ref>The Hocken Library contains several early journals and notebooks of early missionaries documenting the vagaries of the southern dialect. Several of them are shown at Blackman, A. \"[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/thehockenblog/2011/07/07/some-sources-for-southern-maori-dialect/ Some Sources for Southern Maori dialect]\", Hocken Library, 7 July 2001. Retrieved 3 December 2014.</ref> Maarire Goodall and [[George Griffiths (historian)|Griffiths]] say there is also a voicing of ''k'' to ''g'' \u2013 this is why the region of [[Otago]] (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after \u2013 [[Otakou]] (standard M\u0101ori) \u2013 vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) pp. 46\u20138.</ref> Westland's [[Waitangitaona River]] became two distinct rivers after an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]], each named in a differing dialect. While the northern river was named the ''Waitangit\u0101huna River'', the southern river became the ''Waitakit\u0101huna-ki-te-Toka'', using the more usual southern spelling (''ki-te-Toka'', \"of the south\", would be rendered ''ki-te-Tonga'' in standard M\u0101ori).\n\nThe standard M\u0101ori ''r'' is also found occasionally changed to an ''l'' in these southern dialects and the ''wh'' to ''w''. These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as [[Lake Waihola]]<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) p. 50: ''Southern dialect for 'wai' \u2013 water, 'hora' \u2013 spread out.''</ref> and the nearby coastal settlement of [[Wangaloa]] (which would, in standard M\u0101ori, be rendered ''Whangaroa''), and [[Little Akaloa]], on [[Banks Peninsula]]. Goodall and Griffiths claim that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as [[schwa]] or that they are [[Elision|elided]] (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly-bastardised place names as [[The Kilmog]], which in standard M\u0101ori would have been rendered ''Kirimoko'', but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced very much as the current name suggests.<ref>Goodall & Griffiths (1980) p. 45: ''This hill <nowiki>[The Kilmog]</nowiki>...has a much debated name, but its origins are clear to Kaitahu and the word illustrates several major features of the southern dialect. First we must restore the truncated final vowel (in this case to both parts of the name, 'kilimogo'). Then substitute r for l, k for g, to obtain the northern pronunciation, 'kirimoko'.... Though final vowels existed in Kaitahu dialect, the elision was so nearly complete that [[p\u0101keh\u0101]] recorders often omitted them entirely.''</ref> This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, ''kainga'' in standard M\u0101ori), near [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] and [[Akaroa]], and the early spelling of [[Lake Wakatipu]] as ''Wagadib''. In standard M\u0101ori, Wakatipu would have been rendered ''Whakatipua'', showing further the elision of a final vowel.\n\nDespite being officially regarded as extinct,<ref>As with many \"dead\" languages, there is a possibility that the southern dialect may be revived, especially with the encouragement mentioned. \"The [[Murihiku]] language \u2013 Mulihig' being probably better expressive of its state in 1844 \u2013 lives on in Watkin's vocabulary list and in many [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbirding]] terms still in use, and may flourish again in the new climate of [[Maoritanga|Maoritaka]].\" (Natusch, S.

The personal pronouns have a distinction in [[clusivity]], singular, dual and plural numbers,<ref>Biggs 1998: 32-33</ref> and the genitive pronouns have different classes (''a'' class, ''o'' class and neutral) according to whether the possession is [[Alienable and inalienable possession|alienable]] or the possessor has control of the relationship (''a'' category), or the possession is [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] or the possessor has no control over the relationship (''o'' category), and a third [[Possessive determiner|neutral class]] that only occurs for singular pronouns and must be followed by a noun.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\">Biggs 1998: 46-48</ref>\n\n=== Bases ===\nBiggs (1998) developed an analysis that the basic unit of M\u0101ori speech is the phrase rather than the word.<ref>Biggs 1998: 3</ref> The lexical word forms the \"base\" of the phrase. \"Nouns\" include those bases that can take a definite article, but cannot occur as the nucleus of a verbal phrase; for example: ''ika'' (fish) or ''r\u0101kau'' (tree).<ref>Biggs 1998: 54-55</ref> Plurality is marked by various means, including the definite article (singular ''te'', plural ''ng\u0101''),<ref>Bauer 1997: 144-147</ref> deictic particles \"t\u0113r\u0101 r\u0101kau\" (that tree), \"\u0113r\u0101 r\u0101kau\" (those trees),<ref>Bauer 1997: 153-154</ref> possessives \"taku whare\" (my house), \"aku whare\" (my houses).<ref>Bauer 1997: 394-396</ref> A few nouns lengthen a vowel in the plural, such as ''wahine'' (woman); ''w\u0101hine'' (women).<ref>Bauer 1997: 160</ref> In general, bases used as qualifiers follow the base they qualify, e.g. \"matua wahine\" (mother, female elder) from \"matua\" (parent, elder) \"wahine\" (woman).<ref>Biggs 1998: 153</ref>\n\nStatives serve as bases usable as verbs but not available for passive use, such as ''ora'', alive or ''tika'', correct.<ref>Biggs 1998: 55</ref> Grammars generally refer to them as \"stative verbs\". When used in sentences, statives require different syntax than other verb-like bases.<ref>Biggs 1998: 23-24</ref>\n\n'''Locative bases''' can follow the locative particle ''ki'' (to, towards) directly, such as ''runga'', above, ''waho'', outside, and placenames (''ki Tamaki'', to Auckland).<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 57\">Biggs 1998: 57</ref>\n\n'''Personal''' bases take the personal article ''a'' after ''ki'', such as names of people (''ki a Hohepa'', to Joseph), personified houses, personal pronouns, ''wai?'' who? and ''Mea'', so-and-so.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 57\"/>\n\n=== Particles ===\nLike all other Polynesian languages, M\u0101ori has a rich array of particles, which include verbal particles, pronouns, locative particles, articles and possessives.\n\nVerbal particles indicate aspectual, tense related or modal properties of the verb to which they relate to. They include:\n\n* ''i'' (past)\n* ''e'' (non-past)\n* ''kei te'' (present continuous)\n* ''kua'' (perfect)\n* ''e ... ana'' (imperfect, continuous)\n* ''ka'' (inceptive, future)\n* ''kia'' (desiderative)\n* ''me'' (prescriptive)\n* ''kei'' (warning, \"lest\")\n* ''ina'' or ''ana'' (punctative-conditional, \"if and when\")<ref>Bauer 1997: 84-100</ref>\n* ''k\u0101ti'' (cessative)<ref>Bauer 1997: 447</ref>\n*''ai'' (habitual)<ref>Bauer 1997: 98</ref>\n\nLocative particles (prepositions) refer to position in time and/or space, and include:\n\n*''ki'' (to, towards)\n*''kei'' (at)\n*''i'' (past position)\n*''hei'' (future position)<ref>Bauer 1997: 30</ref>\n\nPossessives fall into one of two classes of prepositions marked by ''a'' and ''o'', depending on the dominant versus subordinate relationship between possessor and possessed: ''ng\u0101 tamariki a te matua'', the children of the parent but ''te matua o ng\u0101 tamariki'', the parent of the children.<ref>Biggs 1998: 42</ref>\n\n=== Articles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!'''Definite'''\n|      ''te''\n|  ''ng\u0101''\n|-\n!'''Indefinite'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |            ''he''\n|-\n!'''Proper'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |            ''a''\n|}\n\nDefinitives include the articles ''te'' (singular) and ''ng\u0101'' (plural)<ref>Biggs 1998: 7-8</ref> and the possessive prepositions ''t\u0101'' and ''t\u014d''.<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\"/> These also combine with the pronouns.\n\nThe indefinite article ''he'' is usually positioned at the beginning of the phrase in which it is used. The indefinite article is used when the base is used indefinitely or nominally. These phrases can be identified as an indefinite nominal phrase. The article either can be translated to the English \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018some\u2019, but the number will not be indicated by ''he.'' The indefinite article ''he'' when used with mass nouns like water and sand will always mean 'some'.<ref>Biggs 1998: 7</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''He t\u0101ne''\n|A man\n|Some men\n|-\n|''He k\u014dtiro''\n|A girl\n|Some girls\n|-\n|''He k\u0101inga''\n|A village\n|Some villages\n|-\n|''He \u0101poro''\n|An apple\n|Some apples\n|}\nThe proper article ''a'' is used for personal nouns. The personal nouns do not have the definite or indefinite articles on the proper article unless it is an important part of its name.

Other definitives include ''t\u0113hea?'' (which?), and ''t\u0113tahi'', (a certain). The plural is formed just by dropping the ''t'': ''t\u0113nei'' (this), ''\u0113nei'' (these). The related adverbs are ''nei'' (here), ''n\u0101'' (there, near you)'', r\u0101'' (over there, near him).<ref>Bauer 1997: 152-154</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Adverb\n|-\n!Proximal\n|''t\u0113nei''\n|''\u0113nei''\n|''nei''\n|-\n!Medial\n|''t\u0113n\u0101''\n|''\u0113n\u0101''\n|''n\u0101''\n|-\n!Distal\n|''t\u0113r\u0101''\n|''\u0113r\u0101''\n|''r\u0101''\n|}\n\n=== Pronouns ===\n\n==== Personal pronouns ====\nPronouns have singular, dual and plural number.

For example: ''ia'' (he/she), ''r\u0101ua'' (they two), ''r\u0101tou'' (they, three or more). M\u0101ori pronouns and possessives further distinguish exclusive \"we\" from inclusive \"we\", second and third. It has the plural pronouns: ''m\u0101tou'' (we, exc), ''t\u0101tou'' (we, inc), ''koutou'' (you), ''r\u0101tou'' (they). The language features the dual pronouns: ''m\u0101ua'' (we two, exc), ''t\u0101ua'' (we two, inc), ''k\u014drua'' (you two), ''r\u0101ua'' (they two). The difference between [[Clusivity|exclusive and inclusive]] lies in the treatment of the person addressed. ''M\u0101tou'' refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (\"I and some others but not you\"), and ''t\u0101tou'' refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to and everyone else (\"you, I and others\"):<ref>Bauer 1997: 261-262</ref>\n\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 koe'': hello (to one person)\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 k\u014drua'': hello (to two people)\n* ''T\u0113n\u0101 koutou'': hello (to more than two people)<ref>''[http://www.maorilanguage.net/maori-words-phrases/greetings-mihi/ Greetings - Mihi]'', M\u0101oriLanguage.net, Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n==== Possessive pronouns ====\nThe possessive pronouns vary according to person, number, clusivity, and possessive class (a class or o class). Example: t\u0101ku pene (my pen), \u0101ku pene (my pens). For dual and plural subject pronouns, the possessive form is analytical, by just putting the possessive particle ('''t\u0101/t\u014d''' for singular objects or '''\u0101/\u014d''' for plural objects) before the personal pronouns, e.g. ''t\u0101 t\u0101tou karaihe'' (our class), ''t\u014d r\u0101ua whare'' (their [dual] house); ''\u0101 t\u0101tou karaihe'' (our classes). The neuter one must be followed by a noun and only occur for singular first, second and third persons. ''Taku'' is my, ''aku'' is my (plural, for many possessed items). The plural is made by deleting the initial [t].<ref name=\"Biggs 1998: 46-48\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Singular\n! colspan=\"3\" |Plural\n|-\n!Number\n!Person\n!a class\n!o class\n!neutral\n!a class\n!o class\n!neutral\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Singular\n!1\n|t\u0101ku\n|t\u014dku\n|taku\n|\u0101ku\n|\u014dku\n|aku\n|-\n!2\n|t\u0101u\n|t\u014du\n|t\u014d\n|\u0101u\n|\u014du\n|\u014d\n|-\n!3\n|t\u0101na\n|t\u014dna\n|tana\n|\u0101na\n|\u014dna\n|ana\n|}\n\n==== Interrogative pronouns ====\n* ''wai'' ('who')\n* ''aha'' ('what')\n* ''hea'' ('where')\n* ''n\u014d hea'' ('whence')\n* ''\u0101hea'' ('when')\n* ''e hia'' ('how many [things]')\n* ''tokohia'' ('how many [people]')\n* ''p\u0113hea'' ('how')\n* ''t\u0113hea'' ('which'), \u0113hea ('which [pl.]')\n* ''he aha ... ai'' ('why [reason]')\n* ''n\u0101 te aha ... ai'' ('why [cause]')<ref>''[https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/questions Questions]'', Kupu o te R\u0101, Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n=== Phrase grammar ===\nA phrase spoken in M\u0101ori can be broken up into two parts: the \u201cnucleus\u201d or \"head\" and \u201cperiphery\u201d (modifiers, determiners). The nucleus can be thought of as the meaning and is the centre of the phrase, whereas the periphery is where the grammatical meaning is conveyed and occurs before and/or after the nucleus.<ref>Biggs 1998: 4</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Periphery'''\n|'''Nucleus'''\n|'''Periphery'''\n|-\n|''te''\n|''whare''\n|''nei''\n|-\n|''ki te''\n|''whare''\n|\n|}\n\nThe nucleus ''whare'' can be translated as \"house\", the periphery ''te'' is similar to an article \"the\" and the periphery ''nei'' indicates proximity to the speaker. The whole phrase, ''te whare nei'', can then be translated as \"this house\".<ref>Biggs 1998: 5</ref>\n\n==== Phrasal particles ====\nA definite and declarative sentence (may be a copulative sentence) begins with the declarative particle ''ko''.<ref>Biggs 1998: 15-17</ref> If the sentence is topicalized (agent topic, only in non-present sentences) the particle '''''n\u0101''''' begins the sentence (past tense) or the '''''m\u0101''''' (future, imperfective) followed by the agent/subject. In these cases the word order changes to SVO. These agent topicalizing particles can contract with singular personal pronouns and vary according to the possessive classes: ''n\u0101ku'' can be though of as meaning \"as for me\" and behave like an emphatic or dative pronoun.<ref>Biggs 1998: 87-89</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Agent topic pronouns\n!\n!Past\n!Future\n|-\n!1S\n|n\u0101ku/n\u014dku\n|m\u0101ku/m\u014dku\n|-\n!2S\n|n\u0101u/n\u014du\n|m\u0101u/m\u014d\n|-\n!3S\n|n\u0101na/n\u014dna\n|m\u0101na/m\u014dna\n|}\n\n==== Case particles ====\n* Nominative: ko<ref>Bauer 1997: 181</ref>\n* Accusative: i<ref>Bauer 1997: 175-176</ref>\n* Dative/directional locative: ki<ref>Bauer 1997: 176-179</ref>\n* Genitive: a/o<ref>Bauer 1997: 183-184</ref>\n\n=== Negation ===\nForming negative phrases in M\u0101ori is quite grammatically complex. There are several different negators which are used under various specific circumstances.<ref name=\":5\">Bauer 2001: 139</ref> The four main negators are as follows:<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Negator\n!Description\n|-\n|''k\u0101o''\n|Negative answer to a polar question.\n|-\n|''k\u0101ore/k\u0101hore/k\u0101re/''\n|The most common verbal negator.\n|-\n|''kore''\n|A strong negator, equivalent to 'never'.\n|-\n|''kaua e''\n|Negative imperatives; prohibitive \n|-\n|''ehara''\n|Negation for copulative phrases, topicalized and equative phrases\n|}\n\n''K\u012bhai'' and ''t\u0113'' are two negators which may be seen in specific dialects or older texts, but are not widely used.<ref name=\":5\" /> The most common negator is ''k\u0101hore'', which may occur in one of four forms, with the ''k\u0101o'' form only being used in response to a question.<ref name=\":5\" /> Negative phrases, besides using ''k\u0101ore,'' also affect the form of verbal particles, as illustrated below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Verbal Particles<ref name=\":5\" />\n!\n!Positive\n!Negative\n|-\n!Past\n|i\n|i\n|-\n!Future\n|ka\n|i/e\n|-\n!Present\n|kei te\n|i te\n|-\n!Imperfect\n| colspan=\"2\" |e...ana\n|-\n!Past perfect\n|kua\n|kia\n|}\n\nThe general usage of ''k\u0101hore'' can be seen in the following examples.

For example, -ia (or just -a if the verb ends in [i]). The other passive suffixes, some of which are very rare, are: -hanga/-hia/-hina/-ina/-kia/-kina/-mia/-na/-nga/-ngia/-ria/-rina/-tia/-whia/-whina/.<ref>Harlow, Ray (2015). ''A M\u0101ori Reference Grammar'', Wellington: Huia, p. 113</ref> The use of the passive suffix -ia is given in this sentence: ''Kua hanga'''ia''' te marae e ng\u0101 tohunga'' (The marae has been built by the experts). The active form of this sentence is rendered as: ''Kua hanga ng\u0101 tohunga i te marae'' (The experts have built the marae). It can seen that the active sentence contains the object marker 'i', that is not present in the passive sentence, while the passive sentence has the agent marker 'e', which is not present in the active sentence.<ref>''[https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/passive-sentences Kupu o te R\u0101: Passive sentences]'', Retrieved 14 September 2019</ref>\n\n=== Polar questions ===\nPolar questions (yes/no questions) can be made by just changing the intonation of the sentence. The answers may be \u0101e (yes) or k\u0101o (no).<ref>Bauer 1997: 424-427</ref>\n\n=== Derivational morphology ===\nAlthough M\u0101ori is mostly analytical there are several derivational affixes:\n\n* -anga, -hanga, -ranga, -tanga (-ness, -ity) (the suffix depends on whether the verb takes, respectively, the -ia, -hia, -ria or -tia passive suffixes) (e.g. ''p\u014dti'' 'vote', ''p\u014dtitanga'' 'election')\n* -nga (nominalizer)<ref>Bauer 1997: 517-524</ref>\n* kai- (agentive noun)<ref>Bauer 1997: 25-26</ref> (e.g. ''mahi'' 'work', ''kaimahi'' 'worker/employee')\n* ma- (adjectives)<ref>Harlow 2015: 112</ref>\n* tua- (ordinal numerals)<ref>Bauer 1997: 282-283</ref> (e.g. ''tahi'' 'one', ''tuatahi'' 'first/primary')\n*whaka- (causative prefix)<ref>Bauer 1997: 44-45</ref> \n\n== Calendar ==\nFrom missionary times, M\u0101ori used adaptations of English names for days of the week and for months of the year. Since about 1990 the M\u0101ori Language Commission has promoted new (\"traditional\") sets. Its days of the week have no pre-European equivalent but reflect the pagan origins of the English names (for example, Hina = moon). The commission based the months of the year on one of the traditional tribal [[lunar calendar]]s.<ref>''[https://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/en/learn/orthographics/ M\u0101ori Orthographic Conventions]'', Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori Language Commission), retrieved 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n{|style=\"background: transparent;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n{|style=\"margin-right: 2em;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5em;\" | Day\n!style=\"width: 8em;\" | Adaptation\n!Official\n|-\n|Monday || Mane || R\u0101hina\n|-\n|Tuesday || T\u016brei || R\u0101t\u016b\n|-\n|Wednesday || Wenerei || R\u0101apa\n|-\n|Thursday || T\u0101ite || R\u0101pare\n|-\n|Friday || Paraire || R\u0101mere\n|-\n|Saturday || R\u0101horoi/H\u0101terei || R\u0101horoi\n|-\n|Sunday || R\u0101tapu/Wiki || R\u0101tapu\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5em;\" | Month\n!style=\"width: 7em;\" | Adaptation\n!Official\n|-\n|January || H\u0101nuere || Kohi-t\u0101tea\n|-\n|February || P\u0113puere || Hui-tanguru\n|-\n|March || M\u0101ehe || Pout\u016b-te-rangi\n|-\n|April || \u0100perira || Paenga-wh\u0101wh\u0101\n|-\n|May || Mei || Haratua\n|-\n|June || Hune || Pipiri\n|-\n|July || H\u016brae || H\u014dngongoi\n|-\n|August || \u0100kuhata || Here-turi-k\u014dk\u0101\n|-\n|September || Hepetema || Mahuru\n|-\n|October || Oketopa || Whiringa-\u0101-nuku\n|-\n|November || Noema || Whiringa-\u0101-rangi\n|-\n|December || T\u012bhema || Hakihea\n|}\n|}\n\n== Influence on New Zealand English ==\n{{Main|M\u0101ori influence on New Zealand English}}\n[[New Zealand English]] has gained many loanwords from M\u0101ori, mainly the names of birds, plants, fishes and places. For example, the [[kiwi]], the [[national bird]], takes its name from ''te reo''. \"[[Kia ora]]\" (literally \"be healthy\") is a widely adopted greeting of M\u0101ori origin, with the intended meaning of \"hello\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swarbrick|first1=Nancy|title=Manners and social behaviour|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/manners-and-social-behaviour/page-7|website=teara.govt.nz|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en|date=5 September 2013}}</ref> It can also mean \"thank you\", or signify agreement with a speaker at a meeting. The M\u0101ori greetings \"t\u0113n\u0101 koe\" (to one person), \"t\u0113n\u0101 k\u014drua\" (to two people) or \"t\u0113n\u0101 koutou\" (to three or more people) are also widely used, as are farewells such as \"haere r\u0101\". The M\u0101ori phrase \"kia kaha\", \"be strong\", is frequently encountered as an indication of moral support for someone starting a stressful undertaking or otherwise in a difficult situation. Many other words such as \"[[wh\u0101nau]]\" (meaning \"family\") and \"kai\" (meaning \"food\") are also widely understood and used by New Zealanders.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Languages|New Zealand}}\n* [[M\u0101ori Language Week|M\u0101ori Language Week (Te Wiki o te Reo M\u0101ori)]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Banks, Sir Joseph]].

Rocky, a small-time [[club fighter]], gets a shot at the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]]. The film also stars [[Talia Shire]] as Adrian, [[Burt Young]] as Adrian's brother Paulie, [[Burgess Meredith]] as Rocky's trainer [[Mickey Goldmill]], and [[Carl Weathers]] as the reigning champion, [[Apollo Creed]].\n\nThe film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a [[sleeper hit]]; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the [[1976 in film|highest-grossing film of 1976]]. The film was critically acclaimed and solidified Stallone's career as well as commenced his rise to prominence as a major [[movie star]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml|title=Inside the Actors Studio with Sylvester Stallone|publisher=[[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041106/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 28, 2006}}</ref> Among other accolades, it went on to receive ten [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". ''Rocky'' is considered to be one of [[List of films considered the best#Sports|the greatest sports films ever made]] and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]'', by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2008.\n\nThe film has spawned [[Rocky (film series)|seven sequels]]: ''[[Rocky II]]'' (1979), ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982), ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985), ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990), ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006), ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015), and ''[[Creed II]]'' (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all eight films, wrote seven of the eight films, and directed four of the six titular installments. In July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please try to refrain from expanding the plot, adding POV style information and including aspects of the fight that the reader doesn't need to know and can learn from renting the film.

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nCreed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], a journeyman [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a loan shark. Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens under the presumption that Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as [[punching bag]]s.\n\nRocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, an former [[bantamweight]] fighter who turned trainer and whose gym Rocky frequents, about training him further. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and sees him as a wasted talent, but eventually accepts the offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish [[pet shop]], culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie helps him get a date for his sister and even offered to work as a corner man with him, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meat packing business]] Paulie works for as part of the upcoming fight. Rocky turned him down. The night before the fight, a sleepless Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone. That is he can go the distance and still standing he won't be another bum from a neighborhood.\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut in order to restore his vision. Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]] (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino]]\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill]]\n* [[Thayer David]] as [[List of Rocky characters#George \"Miles\" Jergens|George \"Miles\" Jergens]]\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Tony Gazzo|Tony Gazzo]]\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]\n* [[Pedro Lovell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Spider Rico|Spider Rico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975.

The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards. Real-life boxer [[Ken Norton]] was initially sought for the role of [[Apollo Creed]], but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to [[Carl Weathers]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vellin|first1=Bob|title=Former heavyweight champion Ken Norton dies at 70|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/09/18/former-heavywegith-champion-ken-norton-die/2834521/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|date=September 19, 2013}}</ref> Norton had had three fights with [[Muhammad Ali]], upon whom Creed was loosely based. According to ''The Rocky Scrapbook'', [[Carrie Snodgress]] was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. [[Susan Sarandon]] auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character. After [[Talia Shire]]'s ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, along with Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nBoxer [[Joe Frazier]] has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film. The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] who fought Frazier three times. During the [[49th Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. Some of the plot's most memorable moments\u2014Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], as part of his training regimen\u2014are taken from the real-life exploits of Joe Frazier, for which he received no credit.<ref name = \"Joe Frazier Inspiration\">{{cite news|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|work=The Guardian|first=Donald|last=McRae|date=November 11, 2008|accessdate=October 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\nDue to the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles.

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nCreed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], a journeyman [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a loan shark. Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens under the presumption that Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as [[punching bag]]s.\n\nRocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, an former [[bantamweight]] fighter who turned trainer and whose gym Rocky frequents, about training him further. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and sees him as a wasted talent, but eventually accepts the offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish [[pet shop]], culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie helps him get a date for his sister and even offered to work as a corner man with him, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meat packing business]] Paulie works for as part of the upcoming fight. Rocky turned him down. The night before the fight, a sleepless Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone. That is he can go the distance and still standing he won't be another bum from a neighborhood.\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut in order to restore his vision. Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]] (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino]]\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill]]\n* [[Thayer David]] as [[List of Rocky characters#George \"Miles\" Jergens|George \"Miles\" Jergens]]\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Tony Gazzo|Tony Gazzo]]\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]\n* [[Pedro Lovell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Spider Rico|Spider Rico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975.

Osmond first gained fame performing with four of his elder brothers as [[the Osmonds]], earning several top ten hits and gold albums. Then, in the early 1970s, Osmond began a solo career, earning several additional top ten hits, including \"[[Go Away Little Girl]],\" (U.S. No. 1) \"[[Puppy Love (Paul Anka song)#Donny Osmond version|Puppy Love]],\" (U.S. No. 3) and later, \"[[Soldier of Love (Donny Osmond song)|Soldier of Love]]\" (U.S. No. 2). He also recorded the popular song \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\" for the 1998 Disney film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\nOsmond further gained fame due to the success of the [[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|1976\u201379 self-titled variety series Donny & Marie]]. The ''Donny & Marie'' duo released a series of top ten hits and gold albums and hosted a syndicated and [[Daytime Emmy Award]]-nominated [[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|1998\u20132000 talk show]]. He also hosted ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' from 2002-2004. Most recently, Donny & Marie headlined an 11-year Las Vegas residency at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]] (2008-2019).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/18/marie-donny-osmond-fight-tears-during-last-las-vegas-show/4233723002/ |title=Marie and Donny Osmond fight back tears during last Las Vegas show |website=Usatoday.com |date=2019-11-18 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref>[https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/donny-marie-osmond-end-long-running-vegas-residency-67104017  Donny and Marie Osmond end their long-running Vegas residency with emotional show] Good Morning America. 18 November 2019. Retrieved 13 April 2020.</ref> \n\nOsmond also successfully competed on two reality TV shows, winning [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 9)|season 9]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and being named runner-up for [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|season 1]] of ''[[The Masked Singer (U.S. TV series)|The Masked Singer]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nOsmond was born on December 9, 1957 in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah, the seventh son of [[Olive Osmond|Olive May]] (n\u00e9e Davis; 1925&ndash;2004) and [[George Osmond|George Virl Osmond]] (1917&ndash;2007). He is the brother of [[Alan Osmond|Alan]], [[Jay Osmond|Jay]], [[Jimmy Osmond|Jimmy]], [[Merrill Osmond|Merrill]], [[Wayne Osmond|Wayne]], [[Marie Osmond|Marie]], [[Tom Osmond|Tom]], and Virl Osmond. Alan, Jay, Merrill, Wayne, and Donny were members of the popular singing group [[the Osmonds]] (also known as the Osmond Brothers). Osmond was raised as a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in Utah along with his siblings. Osmond has traced some of his family ancestry back to [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales; his journey was documented in a [[BBC Wales]] program, ''Donny Osmond Coming Home''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1287475.stm |title=Osmond Traces Welch Ancestors |work=[[BBC News]] |date=April 20, 2001 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> On the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The One Show]]'', a plaque was unveiled in the town to commemorate 'the ancestors of Donny Osmond.'

In short order, the group was invited to audition for ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''. Williams initially had reservations about featuring children on the program, however, encouraged by his father to try them out, they proved in a short period of time to become an asset to the program, and soon became regulars on the show and gained popularity quickly.  In 1963, Donny Osmond made his debut on the show at the age of five singing \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\". The brothers continued to perform on the show throughout the 1960s along with a visit from their sister Marie.\n\nOsmond became a [[teen idol]] in the early 1970s as a solo singer, while continuing to sing with his older brothers. Osmond was one of the biggest \"Cover Boy\" pop stars for ''[[Tiger Beat]]'' magazine in the early 1970s. His first solo hit was a cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s 1958 recording of \"[[Sweet and Innocent (Donny Osmond song)|Sweet and Innocent]]\", which peaked at No. 7 in the U.S. in 1971.  Osmond's follow-ups \"Go Away Little Girl\" (1971) (U.S. No. 1), \"Puppy Love\" (U.S. No. 3), and \"[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]/[[I Knew You When (song)|I Knew You When]]\" (U.S. No. 9) (1972) vaulted him into international fame, further advanced by his November 20, 1972 appearance on the ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' show, where he sang \"[[Too Young (popular song)|Too Young]]\" to Lucy's niece, played by [[Eve Plumb]], and sang with [[Lucie Arnaz]] (\"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\").\n\n===Comeback: 1989\u20131990===\nIn the 1980s, all of the Osmonds abandoned their earlier image that had originally been crafted to appeal to young viewers, hoping to reach a more adult audience. While his brothers moved toward country music to modest success, Donny was able to revive his career in popular music. He made an unlikely appearance as one of several celebrities and unknowns auditioning to sing for guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] in the video for Beck's 1985 single \"Ambitious\" \u2013 which was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich \u2013 followed in 1986 by an equally unlikely cameo in the animated [[Luis Cardenas]] music video \"Runaway\".<ref>{{YouTube|gWAh9SFqZMI|Luis Cardenas Runaway Video with Osmond as the Angry Neighbor}}</ref>  He spent several years as a performer, before hiring the services of music and entertainment guru [[Steven Machat]], who got Osmond together with English singer-songwriter [[Peter Gabriel]] to see whether Machat and Gabriel could turn the TV Osmond's image into a contemporary young pop act.  They succeeded, returning Osmond to the US charts in 1989 with the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 song \"[[Soldier of Love (Donny Osmond song)|Soldier of Love]]\" and its top twenty follow-up \"[[Sacred Emotion]]\". Launching an extensive tour in support of the [[Eyes Don't Lie]] record, he enlisted [[Earth Wind & Fire]] and [[Kenny Loggins]] guitarist [[Dick Smith (musician)|Dick Smith]] along with keyboardist [[Mark Jackson (musician)|Mark Jackson]].\n\nOsmond was often reluctant to perform his earliest songs, in particular \"Go Away Little Girl\", but was convinced to sing the song live for [[KLOS-FM]]'s ''Mark & Brian Christmas Show'' on December 21, 1990. Now he embraces his initial recording period with fondness, and recognizes that his many fans around the world are always excited and appreciative to hear his earliest chart successes.\n\n===Current music career: 1991\u2013present===\nOsmond was the guest vocalist on [[Dweezil Zappa]]'s star-studded version of the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" which appeared on Zappa's 1991 album ''Confessions''. The song also included guitar solos from [[Zakk Wylde]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Warren DeMartini]], [[Nuno Bettencourt]], and [[Tim Pierce]]. Osmond sang \"No One Has To Be Alone\", which was heard at the end of the film ''[[The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water]]''. He also sang \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" for Disney's ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\nIn the 2000s, he released a Christmas album, an album of his favorite Broadway songs, and a compilation of popular love songs. In 2004, he returned to the UK Top 10 for the first time as a solo artist since 1973, with the [[George Benson]]-sampling \"Breeze On By\", co-written with former teen idol [[Gary Barlow]], from the 1990s UK boy band [[Take That]], reaching number 8.\n\nHis forthcoming 16th album ''The Soundtrack of My Life'' features a collection of cover songs with personal meaning to Osmond. He enlisted [[Stevie Wonder]] to play harmonica on track \"My Cherie Amour\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6319888/donny-osmond-stevie-wonder-my-cherie-amour |title=Donny Osmond Sings 'My Cherie Amour' With Stevie Wonder on Harmonica: Exclusive |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 17, 2014 |first=Joe |last=Lynch |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Donny & Marie in Las Vegas===\n[[File:Flamingo (20675275461).jpg|thumb|\"Donny & Marie\" marquee at the Flamingo Las Vegas]]\nFollowing Marie's stint on ''Dancing with the Stars'' in 2007, the pair teamed up for a limited six-week engagement in Las Vegas.

[[Fred Silverman]] offered them a show of their own, ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|The Donny & Marie Show]]'', a television variety series which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1976 and 1979. In honor of their impact on American pop culture, Donny and Marie received the Pop Culture Award at the 2015 [[TV Land Awards]]. In the past, Osmond has expressed regret that the show was canceled, as opposed to Marie and he deciding when to bring the show to conclusion.  \n\nDonny and Marie also co-hosted an eponymous and syndicated talk show ''[[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]'' from 1998 to 2000. Though they received back-to-back nominations for the [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] in [[27th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Talk Show Hosts|2000]] and [[28th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Talk Show Hosts|2001]],<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005287/awards| title=Awards for Donny Osmond| publisher=IMDb.com| accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref> the show was ultimately canceled.  In a 1999 episode featuring [[Jefferson Starship]] promoting their album ''Windows of Heaven'', the hosts performed a rendition of \"[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]]\" live with the band.\n\n===Other hosting opportunities===\nOsmond went on to host ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', a syndicated version of the [[Dick Clark]]-hosted television game show that ran two seasons in the US from 2002 to 2004, and a British version of ''Pyramid'' on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in 2007.  For his performance on Pyramid, Osmond was nominated for a [[30th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outsanding Game Show Host|Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Shown Host]] in 2003. \n\nOsmond returned to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as host of ''[[The Great American Dream Vote]]'', a prime-time reality/game show that debuted in March 2007.

As of January 2012, ''The Donny Osmond Show'' is no longer broadcasting on [[The Breeze (radio network)|The Breeze]].\n\n===Music===\n\nOsmond's name was used in the lyrics of Alice Cooper's song [[Department of Youth (song)|Department of Youth]] on the album, [[Welcome to My Nightmare]]. As the song fades, Cooper can be heard asking the youth choir backing him up, \"Who's got the power?\" to which a crowd of young people screams \"we do!\" After a couple of repetitions, this changes to \"We've got the power\" with a cheering response. On the final repetition, Cooper changes the question to \"...and who gave it to you?\" The crowd answers, \"Donny Osmond!\" Cooper then responds \"What?!\" Donny Osmond is also featured in the song \"Start the Par-dee\" with the artist [[Lil Yachty]]. His most iconic line is \"My name is Donny O, and you know I love my ravio's\".\n\n===Musical theater===\nHis first foray into Broadway musical theater was the lead role in a revival of the 1904 [[George M.

In 1982, he co-starred with [[Priscilla Barnes]] and [[Joan Collins]] in the television movie ''[[The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch]]'' for [[Aaron Spelling]].\n\nIn 1978, he appeared in ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' with sister Marie.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077620|Goin' Coconuts}}</ref> {{citation span|1=His future wife Debbie made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1998, Osmond was chosen as the singing voice of Shang in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''Mulan''. He sang \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\".\n\nAlso in 1999, he starred as [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] in the movie version of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s request who said, \"to me, there is no better selection.\"\n\nIn 2002 he sang \"No One Has to Be Alone\" for the end credits of ''[[The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water]]''.\n\nIn the ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' special \"Built to be Wild\", he played Jackaroo the pickup truck.\n\nOsmond remarked in an interview recently that his movie appearance on ''[[College Road Trip]]'' and upcoming appearances on two Disney Channel shows that he would be coming about full circle since he and his family were discovered by [[Walt Disney]].\n\nOsmond appears in the music video of [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s song \"[[White & Nerdy]]\". The song is a parody of [[Chamillionaire]]'s \"[[Ridin']]\"; Osmond's role is analogous to that of [[Krayzie Bone]]'s role in the original video. Yankovic asked Osmond to appear because \"if you have to have a white and nerdy icon in your video, like who else do you go for?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/weirdal/index.html |title=The World's Greatest Pop Culture Site |publisher=retroCRUSH |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220045444/http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/weirdal/index.html |archive-date=February 20, 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, he was revealed to be the Peacock on '' [[The Masked Singer (U.S. TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' where he was the runner-up.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spellberg |first1=Claire |title=\u2018The Masked Singer\u2019 Finale Reveals T-Pain, Gladys Knight, and Donny Osmond |url=https://decider.com/2019/02/28/the-masked-singer-monster-t-pain-bee-gladys-knight-peacock-donny-osmond/ |website=Decider |accessdate=February 28, 2019 |language=en |date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Dancing with the Stars''===\nOsmond and professional [[Kym Johnson]] were paired for [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 9)|the 2009 ninth season of ''Dancing with the Stars'']]. He participated in the show to prove he was a better dancer than his sister. It was very difficult for him to manage to get to rehearsals and host his show in Las Vegas with sister [[Marie Osmond|Marie]]. For the first week, the two were assigned to dance a [[Foxtrot]] and a 30-second [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]]. His Foxtrot was said to be \"too theatrical\" and was scored 20/30 from the judges. He, however, managed to maintain a good score when his Salsa scored 10 points and was safe that week. He danced a [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] the following week which was guest judged by [[Baz Luhrmann]]. He scored 25 and was scored second place, called first to be safe. That following week he danced a [[Ballroom rumba|Rumba]] and scored 21.\n\nAfter his comments, he \"toyed with\" openly gay judge [[Bruno Tonioli]], first kissing him, before embracing him and tipping him back in a mock-passionate move after Bruno called Osmond's dance \"a bit airy-fairy\". The following week introduced four new dances including the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] which he danced and scored 24. That following week, the two danced an [[Argentine Tango]] which scored 29/30, the highest scored dance to date until it was beaten by then top scorer and future runner-up [[M\u00fda]] and her 70s-themed [[Samba]]. He had also received that week's encore.\n\nFollowing that week, Osmond and Johnson danced a train-station themed [[Jitterbug]] and was scored a 24. He then danced a [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]] against all couples and was eliminated 6th receiving seven points for a total of 31/40. The following week, he danced a [[Quickstep]] which he quotes \"was one of the worst moments of my life\" and scored 24 and a Team [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] along with [[Joanna Krupa]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]] and received 28/30 and the encore.\n\nIn the 8th week of competition, Osmond was required to dance a Ballroom and decade-themed Latin dance. His Ballroom [[Viennese Waltz]] received 26 but his 1980s themed [[Paso Doble]] received 24 being quoted by judge [[Len Goodman]] as \"the scariest, bizarre Paso Doble we've ever seen\" being awarded the last place on the judges' leaderboard for the first time. Following that week, he danced a Tango and got advice from past runner-up [[Gilles Marini]]. He got tangled in Johnson's dress and received 21 and saying the cause was that \"I saw Marie.\" He then danced the samba to a song originally recorded by his brothers and himself called \"[[One Bad Apple]]\", receiving 26 and a Jitterbug scored 27. He once again was scored last place.\n\nFor the finals week, he danced a [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha-Cha]] (27), a Megamix dance alongside Mya and Kelly Osbourne (28), the only perfect-scoring [[street dance|Freestyle]] (30) and a repeat of his Argentine Tango (30) and won the competition. As he accepted his trophy, he hugged fellow finalist Mya and grabbed his wife, Debbie, and his sister, Marie, on stage.\n\nOn Season 18, he guests judged week five on Disney Night. Again, in October 2014 he guests judged on the British version of the show, ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', on week 3 (movie week) of the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 12)|12th series]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align: center;

Osmond first gained fame performing with four of his elder brothers as [[the Osmonds]], earning several top ten hits and gold albums. Then, in the early 1970s, Osmond began a solo career, earning several additional top ten hits, including \"[[Go Away Little Girl]],\" (U.S. No. 1) \"[[Puppy Love (Paul Anka song)#Donny Osmond version|Puppy Love]],\" (U.S. No. 3) and later, \"[[Soldier of Love (Donny Osmond song)|Soldier of Love]]\" (U.S. No. 2). He also recorded the popular song \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\" for the 1998 Disney film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\nOsmond further gained fame due to the success of the [[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|1976\u201379 self-titled variety series]]. The ''Donny & Marie'' duo released a series of top ten hits and gold albums and hosted a syndicated and [[Daytime Emmy Award]]-nominated [[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|1998\u20132000 talk show]]. He also hosted ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' from 2002-2004. Most recently, Donny & Marie headlined an 11-year Las Vegas residency at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]] (2008-2019).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/18/marie-donny-osmond-fight-tears-during-last-las-vegas-show/4233723002/ |title=Marie and Donny Osmond fight back tears during last Las Vegas show |website=Usatoday.com |date=2019-11-18 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref>[https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/donny-marie-osmond-end-long-running-vegas-residency-67104017  Donny and Marie Osmond end their long-running Vegas residency with emotional show] Good Morning America. 18 November 2019. Retrieved 13 April 2020.</ref> \n\nOsmond also successfully competed on two reality TV shows, winning [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 9)|season 9]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and being named runner-up for [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|season 1]] of ''[[The Masked Singer (U.S. TV series)|The Masked Singer]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nOsmond was born on December 9, 1957 in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah, the seventh son of [[Olive Osmond|Olive May]] (n\u00e9e Davis; 1925&ndash;2004) and [[George Osmond|George Virl Osmond]] (1917&ndash;2007). He is the brother of [[Alan Osmond|Alan]], [[Jay Osmond|Jay]], [[Jimmy Osmond|Jimmy]], [[Merrill Osmond|Merrill]], [[Wayne Osmond|Wayne]], [[Marie Osmond|Marie]], [[Tom Osmond|Tom]], and Virl Osmond. Alan, Jay, Merrill, Wayne, and Donny were members of the popular singing group [[the Osmonds]] (also known as the Osmond Brothers). Osmond was raised as a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in Utah along with his siblings. Osmond has traced some of his family ancestry back to [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales; his journey was documented in a [[BBC Wales]] program, ''Donny Osmond Coming Home''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1287475.stm |title=Osmond Traces Welch Ancestors |work=[[BBC News]] |date=April 20, 2001 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> On the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The One Show]]'', a plaque was unveiled in the town to commemorate 'the ancestors of Donny Osmond.'

In short order, the group was invited to audition for ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''. Williams initially had reservations about featuring children on the program, however, encouraged by his father to try them out, they proved in a short period of time to become an asset to the program, and soon became regulars on the show and gained popularity quickly.  In 1963, Donny Osmond made his debut on the show at the age of five singing \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\". The brothers continued to perform on the show throughout the 1960s along with a visit from their sister Marie.\n\nOsmond became a [[teen idol]] in the early 1970s as a solo singer, while continuing to sing with his older brothers. Osmond was one of the biggest \"Cover Boy\" pop stars for ''[[Tiger Beat]]'' magazine in the early 1970s. His first solo hit was a cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s 1958 recording of \"[[Sweet and Innocent (Donny Osmond song)|Sweet and Innocent]]\", which peaked at No. 7 in the U.S. in 1971.  Osmond's follow-ups \"Go Away Little Girl\" (1971) (U.S. No. 1), \"Puppy Love\" (U.S. No. 3), and \"[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]/[[I Knew You When (song)|I Knew You When]]\" (U.S. No. 9) (1972) vaulted him into international fame, further advanced by his November 20, 1972 appearance on the ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' show, where he sang \"[[Too Young (popular song)|Too Young]]\" to Lucy's niece, played by [[Eve Plumb]], and sang with [[Lucie Arnaz]] (\"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\").\n\n===Comeback: 1989\u20131990===\nIn the 1980s, all of the Osmonds abandoned their earlier image that had originally been crafted to appeal to young viewers, hoping to reach a more adult audience. While his brothers moved toward country music to modest success, Donny was able to revive his career in popular music. He made an unlikely appearance as one of several celebrities and unknowns auditioning to sing for guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] in the video for Beck's 1985 single \"Ambitious\" \u2013 which was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich \u2013 followed in 1986 by an equally unlikely cameo in the animated [[Luis Cardenas]] music video \"Runaway\".<ref>{{YouTube|gWAh9SFqZMI|Luis Cardenas Runaway Video with Osmond as the Angry Neighbor}}</ref>  He spent several years as a performer, before hiring the services of music and entertainment guru [[Steven Machat]], who got Osmond together with English singer-songwriter [[Peter Gabriel]] to see whether Machat and Gabriel could turn the TV Osmond's image into a contemporary young pop act.  They succeeded, returning Osmond to the US charts in 1989 with the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 song \"[[Soldier of Love (Donny Osmond song)|Soldier of Love]]\" and its top twenty follow-up \"[[Sacred Emotion]]\". Launching an extensive tour in support of the [[Eyes Don't Lie]] record, he enlisted [[Earth Wind & Fire]] and [[Kenny Loggins]] guitarist [[Dick Smith (musician)|Dick Smith]] along with keyboardist [[Mark Jackson (musician)|Mark Jackson]].\n\nOsmond was often reluctant to perform his earliest songs, in particular \"Go Away Little Girl\", but was convinced to sing the song live for [[KLOS-FM]]'s ''Mark & Brian Christmas Show'' on December 21, 1990. Now he embraces his initial recording period with fondness, and recognizes that his many fans around the world are always excited and appreciative to hear his earliest chart successes.\n\n===Current music career: 1991\u2013present===\nOsmond was the guest vocalist on [[Dweezil Zappa]]'s star-studded version of the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" which appeared on Zappa's 1991 album ''Confessions''. The song also included guitar solos from [[Zakk Wylde]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Warren DeMartini]], [[Nuno Bettencourt]], and [[Tim Pierce]]. Osmond sang \"No One Has To Be Alone\", which was heard at the end of the film ''[[The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water]]''. He also sang \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" for Disney's ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\nIn the 2000s, he released a Christmas album, an album of his favorite Broadway songs, and a compilation of popular love songs. In 2004, he returned to the UK Top 10 for the first time as a solo artist since 1973, with the [[George Benson]]-sampling \"Breeze On By\", co-written with former teen idol [[Gary Barlow]], from the 1990s UK boy band [[Take That]], reaching number 8.\n\nHis forthcoming 16th album ''The Soundtrack of My Life'' features a collection of cover songs with personal meaning to Osmond. He enlisted [[Stevie Wonder]] to play harmonica on track \"My Cherie Amour\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6319888/donny-osmond-stevie-wonder-my-cherie-amour |title=Donny Osmond Sings 'My Cherie Amour' With Stevie Wonder on Harmonica: Exclusive |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 17, 2014 |first=Joe |last=Lynch |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Donny & Marie in Las Vegas===\n[[File:Flamingo (20675275461).jpg|thumb|\"Donny & Marie\" marquee at the Flamingo Las Vegas]]\nFollowing Marie's stint on ''Dancing with the Stars'' in 2007, the pair teamed up for a limited six-week engagement in Las Vegas.

[[Fred Silverman]] offered them a show of their own, ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|The Donny & Marie Show]]'', a television variety series which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1976 and 1979. In honor of their impact on American pop culture, Donny and Marie received the Pop Culture Award at the 2015 [[TV Land Awards]]. In the past, Osmond has expressed regret that the show was canceled, as opposed to Marie and he deciding when to bring the show to conclusion.  \n\nDonny and Marie also co-hosted an eponymous and syndicated talk show ''[[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]'' from 1998 to 2000. Though they received back-to-back nominations for the [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] in [[27th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Talk Show Hosts|2000]] and [[28th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Talk Show Hosts|2001]],<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005287/awards| title=Awards for Donny Osmond| publisher=IMDb.com| accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref> the show was ultimately canceled.  In a 1999 episode featuring [[Jefferson Starship]] promoting their album ''Windows of Heaven'', the hosts performed a rendition of \"[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]]\" live with the band.\n\n===Other hosting opportunities===\nOsmond went on to host ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', a syndicated version of the [[Dick Clark]]-hosted television game show that ran two seasons in the US from 2002 to 2004, and a British version of ''Pyramid'' on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in 2007.

As the song fades, Cooper can be heard asking the youth choir backing him up, \"Who's got the power?\" to which a crowd of young people screams \"we do!\" After a couple of repetitions, this changes to \"We've got the power\" with a cheering response. On the final repetition, Cooper changes the question to \"...and who gave it to you?\" The crowd answers, \"Donny Osmond!\" Cooper then responds \"What?!\" Donny Osmond is also featured in the song \"Start the Par-dee\" with the artist [[Lil Yachty]]. His most iconic line is \"My name is Donny O, and you know I love my ravio's\".\n\n===Musical theater===\nHis first foray into Broadway musical theater was the lead role in a revival of the 1904 [[George M.

He has also done guest spots on numerous other television shows such as ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' and ''[[Hannah Montana]]''. He also appeared in a [[Pepsi Twist]] commercial during the [[Super Bowl]] with his sister, Marie, and [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]]. In 1982, he co-starred with [[Priscilla Barnes]] and [[Joan Collins]] in the television movie ''[[The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch]]'' for [[Aaron Spelling]].\n\nIn 1978, he appeared in ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' with sister Marie.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077620|Goin' Coconuts}}</ref> {{citation span|1=His future wife Debbie made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1998, Osmond was chosen as the singing voice of Shang in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''Mulan''. He sang \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\".\n\nAlso in 1999, he starred as [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] in the movie version of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s request who said, \"to me, there is no better selection.\"\n\nIn 2002 he sang \"No One Has to Be Alone\" for the end credits of ''[[The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water]]''.\n\nIn the ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' special \"Built to be Wild\", he played Jackaroo the pickup truck.\n\nOsmond remarked in an interview recently that his movie appearance on ''[[College Road Trip]]'' and upcoming appearances on two Disney Channel shows that he would be coming about full circle since he and his family were discovered by [[Walt Disney]].\n\nOsmond appears in the music video of [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s song \"[[White & Nerdy]]\". The song is a parody of [[Chamillionaire]]'s \"[[Ridin']]\"; Osmond's role is analogous to that of [[Krayzie Bone]]'s role in the original video.

He participated in the show to prove he was a better dancer than his sister. It was very difficult for him to manage to get to rehearsals and host his show in Las Vegas with sister [[Marie Osmond|Marie]]. For the first week, the two were assigned to dance a [[Foxtrot]] and a 30-second [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]]. His Foxtrot was said to be \"too theatrical\" and was scored 20/30 from the judges. He, however, managed to maintain a good score when his Salsa scored 10 points and was safe that week. He danced a [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] the following week which was guest judged by [[Baz Luhrmann]]. He scored 25 and was scored second place, called first to be safe. That following week he danced a [[Ballroom rumba|Rumba]] and scored 21.\n\nAfter his comments, he \"toyed with\" openly gay judge [[Bruno Tonioli]], first kissing him, before embracing him and tipping him back in a mock-passionate move after Bruno called Osmond's dance \"a bit airy-fairy\". The following week introduced four new dances including the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] which he danced and scored 24. That following week, the two danced an [[Argentine Tango]] which scored 29/30, the highest scored dance to date until it was beaten by then top scorer and future runner-up [[M\u00fda]] and her 70s-themed [[Samba]]. He had also received that week's encore.\n\nFollowing that week, Osmond and Johnson danced a train-station themed [[Jitterbug]] and was scored a 24. He then danced a [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]] against all couples and was eliminated 6th receiving seven points for a total of 31/40. The following week, he danced a [[Quickstep]] which he quotes \"was one of the worst moments of my life\" and scored 24 and a Team [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] along with [[Joanna Krupa]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]] and received 28/30 and the encore.\n\nIn the 8th week of competition, Osmond was required to dance a Ballroom and decade-themed Latin dance. His Ballroom [[Viennese Waltz]] received 26 but his 1980s themed [[Paso Doble]] received 24 being quoted by judge [[Len Goodman]] as \"the scariest, bizarre Paso Doble we've ever seen\" being awarded the last place on the judges' leaderboard for the first time. Following that week, he danced a Tango and got advice from past runner-up [[Gilles Marini]]. He got tangled in Johnson's dress and received 21 and saying the cause was that \"I saw Marie.\" He then danced the samba to a song originally recorded by his brothers and himself called \"[[One Bad Apple]]\", receiving 26 and a Jitterbug scored 27. He once again was scored last place.\n\nFor the finals week, he danced a [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha-Cha]] (27), a Megamix dance alongside Mya and Kelly Osbourne (28), the only perfect-scoring [[street dance|Freestyle]] (30) and a repeat of his Argentine Tango (30) and won the competition. As he accepted his trophy, he hugged fellow finalist Mya and grabbed his wife, Debbie, and his sister, Marie, on stage.\n\nOn Season 18, he guests judged week five on Disney Night. Again, in October 2014 he guests judged on the British version of the show, ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', on week 3 (movie week) of the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 12)|12th series]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align: center;

About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers\u2019 guilds, consumers\u2019 organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures.\"<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism \"Guild Socialism\".

H. Tawney]], [[L.T. Hobhouse]] and [[J. A. Hobson]]. He made contributions in his early writings about [[industrial democracy]] and workers' self-management.\n\nThe theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). A National Building Guild was established after [[World War I]] but collapsed after funding was withdrawn in 1921.<ref name=\"PH94\"/>{{rp|110}}\n\nAdmiration of guild socialism led to a more \"individualistic\" form of it being suggested as a natural outcome for a united humanity in the science fiction work of Olaf Stapledon-although hundreds of years in the future.\n\nCole's ideas were also promoted by prominent anti-communist intellectuals<ref>\u201c[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Warner.html Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949-50].\u201d [[Central Intelligence Agency]], 27 June 2008,  </ref> such as the British logician [[Bertrand Russell]], first through his 1918 essay Roads to Freedom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guild socialism restated|last=1889-1959.|first=Cole, G.
