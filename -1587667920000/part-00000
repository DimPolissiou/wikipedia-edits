Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]].\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.\n\nAdobe entered [[NASDAQ]] in August 1986.

Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.\n\nIn 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software.

The king of Amer (the former seat of Jaipur state) ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present-day city of Alwar.

Examples include the [[Khanzada Rajputs]], the [[Nikumbha|Nikumbh]] , the [[bargujar|Badgujjar]] , and finally the Naruka ([[Kachwaha]]) Rajputs who took the control over this area. Bhadanakas (Bhadana) clan of [[Gurjar]], The [[Maratha Empire]] also ruled this region for a short period. A Rajput, Partap Singh, took the Alwar Fort from the Jat Raja of Bharatpur and laid down the foundation for modern day Alwar.\n\nThe Hindu King [[Hemu|Hemchandra Vikramaditya]] (Hemu), born into a [[Brahmin]] family in Machari, Rajgarh, a village in Alwar, was a Hindu emperor of North India during the 16th century. This was a period when the Mughals and Afghans were vying for power in the region.

The eastern area of the village is in the same flat area, and the lowland continues for around 1.5-2 km. This area extends to the great forest farms that extend through the valley to the Sava River. About 50 to 100 meters to the east of the road is also the same plane on which supplements a gentle hills difference in altitude is not greater than 10-20 km compared to his village and this flat, and not too steep. Beyond the hilltops is a plain (plateau) which extends about 4-5 km and descends towards Pounje (river valley Una).\n\n==Population==\nIn 1991, \u017divaja had 726 residents, and in 1969 there were 800.

The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village. From the list of 1981.g. with 800 inhabitants, there was a drop to 726 on the list 1991.g.\n\n==Traffic connections==\n[[Highways_in_Croatia#State_roads|State Road]] D224 passes through \u017divaja village from south-east to north-west.\n\n\u017divaja village is a place that has a station for local trains on the searches.

It is spread over approximately 30 square kilometers. Due to its position between two rivers, the [[Sava]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]], the village takes a horseshoe shape.\n\nThe village features dense housing, as well as typical suburban housing on either side of the main road. The railroad runs parallel to the road from south-east to north-west (direction Hr.Dubica-Sisak) on the east side. This part of the village is a mostly flat, lowland area. The eastern area of the village is in the same flat area, and the lowland continues for around 1.5-2 km. This area extends to the great forest farms that extend through the valley to the Sava River. About 50 to 100 meters to the east of the road is also the same plane on which supplements a gentle hills difference in altitude is not greater than 10-20 km compared to his village and this flat, and not too steep. Beyond the hilltops is a plain (plateau) which extends about 4-5 km and descends towards Pounje (river valley Una).\n\n==Population==\nIn 1991, \u017divaja had 726 residents, and in 1969 there were 800.

The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village. From the list of 1981.g. with 800 inhabitants, there was a drop to 726 on the list 1991.g.\n\n==Traffic connections==\n[[Highways_in_Croatia#State_roads|State Road]] D224 passes through \u017divaja village from south-east to north-west.\n\n\u017divaja village is a place that has a station for local trains on the searches.
