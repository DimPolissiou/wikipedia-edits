It is famous as the hometown of [[Martin Luther]]; hence, its official name is '''[[Lutherstadt]] Eisleben'''. As of 2015, Eisleben had a population of 24,198. It lies on the [[Halle\u2013Kassel railway]].\n\nEisleben is divided into old and new towns (Altstadt and Neustadt), the latter of which was created for Eisleben's miners in the 14th century.\n\nEisleben was the capital of the district of [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfelder Land]] and is the seat of the ''[[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft]]'' (\"collective municipality\") [[Lutherstadt Eisleben (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Lutherstadt Eisleben]].\n\n==History==\n\nEisleben was first mentioned in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The [[House of Mansfeld|counts of Mansfeld]] governed the area until the 18th century. During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Count Hoyer VI of Mansfeld-Vorderort (1477\u20131540) remained loyal to his Catholic faith, but the family's Mittelort and Hinterort branches sided with [[Martin Luther]], who ended up dying in Eisleben, as discussed below. The [[German Peasants' War]] devastated the area, about a century before the [[Thirty Years War]]. Count Albert VII of Mansfeld-Hinterort (1480\u20131560) signed the Protestant [[Augsburg Confession]] in 1530 and joined the [[Schmalkaldic League]], a defensive confederation of Protestant princes which ultimately lost the [[Schmalkaldic War]] over Saxony to the forces of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] but gained Lutheranism's recognition as an official religion within the Holy Roman Empire, letting princes determine the official religion within their lands.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, the Countess of Mansfield, [[Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben]] (a Protestant canoness at the Abbey of [[Gerresheim]] to the east) converted Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the [[Archbishop of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]] to [[Calvinism]]. Their marriage and his declaration of religious parity throughout his lands caused another round of religious war, the [[Cologne War]]. The couple fled numerous times through various German states before Gerhard relinquished his claims in 1588. He died and was buried in [[Strassbourg]] in 1601, having failed in his attempt to convert his electorate into a dynasty. His lady (who could not return to the convent) came under the protection of the [[List of rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg|Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and died in 1601, terminating the family's Mittelort branch.\n\nIn 1574, the surviving Mansfeld counts Hans Hoyer, Hans Georg, Hans Albrecht and Bruno concluded an agreement with the [[Elector of Saxony]] to repay the family's extensive debts, but some properties were forfeited by 1579 anyway.

It is famous as the hometown of [[Martin Luther]]; hence, its official name is '''[[Lutherstadt]] Eisleben'''. As of 2015, Eisleben had a population of 24,198. It lies on the [[Halle\u2013Kassel railway]].\n\nEisleben is divided into old and new towns (Altstadt and Neustadt), the latter of which was created for Eisleben's miners in the 14th century.\n\nEisleben was the capital of the district of [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfelder Land]] and is the seat of the ''[[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft]]'' (\"collective municipality\") [[Lutherstadt Eisleben (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Lutherstadt Eisleben]].\n\n==History==\n\nEisleben was first mentioned in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The [[House of Mansfeld|counts of Mansfeld]] governed the area until the 18th century. During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Count Hoyer VI of Mansfeld-Vorderort (1477\u20131540) remained loyal to his Catholic faith, but the family's Mittelort and Hinterort branches sided with [[Martin Luther]], who ended up dying in Eisleben, as discussed below. The [[German Peasants' War]] devastated the area, about a century before the [[Thirty Years War]]. Count Albert VII of Mansfeld-Hinterort (1480\u20131560) signed the Protestant [[Augsburg Confession]] in 1530 and joined the [[Schmalkaldic League]], a defensive confederation of Protestant princes which ultimately lost the [[Schmalkaldic War]] over Saxony to the forces of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] but gained Lutheranism's recognition as an official religion within the Holy Roman Empire, letting princes determine the official religion within their lands.\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, the Countess of Mansfield, [[Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben]] (a Protestant canonness at the Abbey of [[Gerresheim]] to the east) converted Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the [[Archbishop of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]] to [[Calvinism]]. Their marriage and his declaration of religious parity throughout his lands caused another round of religious war, the [[Cologne War]]. The couple fled numerous times through various German states before Gerhard relinquished his claims in 1588. He died and was buried in [[Strassbourg]] in 1601, having failed in his attempt to convert his electorate into a dynasty. His lady (who could not return to the convent) came under the protection of the [[List of rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg|Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and died in 1601, terminating the family's Mittelort branch.\n\nIn 1574, the surviving Mansfeld counts Hans Hoyer, Hans Georg, Hans Albrecht and Bruno concluded an agreement with the [[Elector of Saxony]] to repay the family's extensive debts, but some properties were forfeited by 1579 anyway. The Hinterort branches died out in 1666, but the Mansfeld-Vorderort line lasted until 1780, when it too became extinct and Eisleben came directly under the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended, the [[Vienna Congress]] assigned Eisleben to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which had long been allied with [[House of Welf]] which held the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], and after secularization in 1680 was administered by the [[Elector of Brandenburg]].\n\nThe Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] became part of the [[Free State of Prussia]] after World War I. It was the scene of fighting during the [[March Action]] in 1921.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Eisleben became part of the new state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] (with Magdeburg as its capitol), part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) until Germany's reunification in 1990.\n\nOn 6 June 1927, American aviator [[Clarence D. Chamberlin]] landed in a wheat field outside Eisleben, completing the first transatlantic passenger flight ([[Charles Albert Levine]] was the passenger), and breaking [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s distance record that set only two weeks earlier in [[Paris, France]].\n\n==Helfta==\n[[File:Helfta Convent (Lutherstadt Eisleben), houses for the nuns.jpg|thumb|Modern accommodation for nuns, Helfta Convent (Lutherstadt Eisleben).]]\nThe Counts of Mansfield in 1229 endowed a monastery for women on the grounds of their castle, then built a separate monastery at Helfta near Eisleben, which opened in 1258.

However, Duke Albrecht of [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]] destroyed the nunnery in 1342. Rebuilt the following year, it was sometimes called the \"Queen of German Convents.\" It closed in 1524, during the religious wars sometimes associated with Martin Luther, as discussed below, but reopened on a smaller scale until 1542, after which it became secularized, and controlled by local farmers. In 1712 it became a farm run by the Prussian state, and the buildings reused accordingly. In 1950, the GDR turned it into a fruit farm. In 1994, after Germany's reunification, the Catholic [[Diocese of Magdeburg]] bought the property using donations from all over the world and soon began restoration.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].
