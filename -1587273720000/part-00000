He is widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation. \n\nBorn in [[Birkenhead]], he began his career at his hometown club [[Tranmere Rovers]] before moving on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the club he had supported as a child. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at [[Notts County]]. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt, which in later years would become iconic at the club.\n\n==Early years==\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] and [[Arrowe Park]], and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/03/09/dixie-dean-i-never-had-any-lessons-at-school-no-maths-no-english-nothing-except-football/|title=Interview with John Roberts|last=Roberts|first=John|publisher=SportingIntelligence.com|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football&nbsp;... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&nbsp;... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school&nbsp;... I never had any lessons.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> When he turned 11 he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a [[borstal]] school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nHe left school at 14 and worked for [[Wirral Railway]] as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was 11 years old<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> for [[Great Western Railway]]. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England. He was initiated in Randle Holme Lodge, No. 3261 on 18 February 1931 in Birkenhead,The Wirral.<ref>Article \"The Beautiful Game\" by Patrick Kidd and Matthew Scanlan, published in \"Freemasonry Today,\" No.11, Summer 2010</ref>\n\nAfter retiring, he went on to run the Dublin Packet [[public house|pub]] in [[Chester]] (Everton and the Dublin Packet commemorate this with memorabilia) and work at [[Littlewoods]] [[football pools]] as a porter at their Walton Hall Avenue offices (where he was remembered by fellow workers as a quiet, unassuming man).\n\n==Declining health and death==\n\nIn January 1972, Dean was admitted to St. Catherine's hospital in Birkenhead suffering from the effects of [[influenza]]<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=20 January 1972|work=The Times|page=2}}</ref> and was released a month later.<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=21 February 1972|work=The Times|page=4}}</ref> In November 1976, he had his right leg amputated due to a [[thrombosis|blood clot]]; Dean's health was declining, and he became increasingly homebound.\n\nDean died on 1 March 1980 at age 73 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at Everton's home ground [[Goodison Park]] whilst watching a match against their closest rivals, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

March 1980) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played as a centre forward.\n\nBorn in [[Birkenhead]], he began his career at his hometown club [[Tranmere Rovers]] before moving on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the club he had supported as a child. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at [[Notts County]]. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt, which in later years would become iconic at the club.\n\n==Early years==\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] and [[Arrowe Park]], and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/03/09/dixie-dean-i-never-had-any-lessons-at-school-no-maths-no-english-nothing-except-football/|title=Interview with John Roberts|last=Roberts|first=John|publisher=SportingIntelligence.com|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football&nbsp;... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&nbsp;... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school&nbsp;... I never had any lessons.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> When he turned 11 he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a [[borstal]] school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nHe left school at 14 and worked for [[Wirral Railway]] as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was 11 years old<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> for [[Great Western Railway]]. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England.

To counter the increasing Chinese intrusions into disputed territory, then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] asked for strategies for dealing with them. However, the proposal put forward by the [[Indian Army]] was rejected. Instead, he approved a plan proposed by a bureaucrat called the \"Forward Policy\". This called for the establishment of a number of small posts facing the Chinese. Due the severe rise in public criticism against Chinese intrusions, Nehru implemented the \"Forward Policy\" against the advice of the army.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=73}} The army's concern was that the Chinese had geographical advantage. Additionally, maintaining numerous small posts would be untenable if the Chinese superior forces attacked. This was ruled out by Nehru who believed the Chinese would not attack. But the Chinese did, initiating the Sino-India War.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=74}}\n\n====Battle at Bum La====\nOn 9 September 1962, then [[Defence Minister of India]] [[Krishna Menon]] made a decision to evict the Chinese troops south of Thala Ridge. This decision was endorsed by Nehru, who was in [[London]] to attend the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. Subsequently, the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade|7th Infantry Brigade]], which included 1 Sikh, was ordered to move to [[Namka Chu]], which was considered as militarily unsound and an advantageous ground for the Chinese. This move was strongly criticized by the [[Indian media]], who publicized it with \"sensational headlines\", arguing India's military offensive capability.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=69}}\n\nThe Chinese, aware of these developments, attacked the unprepared Indian post at Namka Chu. Though the Indian troops resisted the attack, they took heavy casualties due to inadequate ammunition and weak communication lines. Soon after the attack, the Chinese advanced to [[Tawang]]. Midway they encountered an Indian post at the [[Bum La Pass]], held by a platoon of 20 men from 1 Sikh.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=69}}<ref name=\"The Story of Subedar Joginder Singh \u2013 Who Crushed Waves Of Chinese Attacks At Bum La In Tawang In 1962\" /> The post was under the command of Singh, now a [[subedar]].{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=69}} The Chinese attacked the post in three waves, each comprising 200 men.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|p=58}} Though the initial two attacks were repelled successfully, by that time, the platoon was depleted to half of its original strength. Singh was also wounded, but refused evacuation. Soon the ammunition was exhausted, and the survivors were only left with their [[bayonet]]s.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=70}}\n\nThe Sikh soldiers then charged towards the Chinese, shouting the war cry ''Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh''.{{efn|{{lang-en|Hail the [[Khalsa]] who belongs to the Lord God! Hail the Lord God to whom belongs the victory}}.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|p=59}}}} The Chinese lines were scattered at this sight and many were bayoneted. Due to heavy numbers and superior weapons, the Chinese were able to withstand the last charge by Singh and his remaining soldiers.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=70}} Before Singh was overpowered and captured by the Chinese, he single-handedly killed several Chinese soldiers with his bayonet. He later succumbed to his injuries and died in Chinese captivity.<ref name=\"The Story of Subedar Joginder Singh \u2013 Who Crushed Waves Of Chinese Attacks At Bum La In Tawang In 1962\" />\n\n=== Param Vir Chakra ===\nThough being heavily outnumbered, Singh led his men, and kept their morale up, in the face of enemy. For his action of gallantry on 23 October 1962, he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|p=59}} The citation reads:\n{{Quotation|\nSubedar Joginder Singh was the commander of a platoon of the Sikh Regiment holding a defensive position at a ridge near Tongpen La in NEFA. At 0530 hours on 23 October 1962, the Chinese opened a very heavy attack on the Bum la axis with the intention of breaking through to Towang. The leading battalion of the enemy attacked the ridge in three waves, each about 200 strong. Subedar Joginder Singh and his men mowed down the first wave, and the enemy was temporarily halted by the heavy losses it suffered. With in a few minutes, a second wave came over and was dealt with similarly. But the platoon had, by then, lost half its men. Subedar Joginder Singh was wounded in the thigh but refused to be evacuated. Under his inspiring leadership the platoon stubbornly held its ground and would not withdraw. Meanwhile the position was attacked for the third time. Subedar Joginder Singh himself manned a light machine-gun and shot down a number of the enemy.

To counter the increasing Chinese intrusions into disputed territory, then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] asked for strategies for dealing with them. However, the proposal put forward by the [[Indian Army]] was rejected. Instead, he approved a plan proposed by a bureaucrat called the \"Forward Policy\". This called for the establishment of a number of small posts facing the Chinese. Due the severe rise in public criticism against Chinese intrusions, Nehru implemented the \"Forward Policy\" against the advice of the army.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=73}} The army's concern was that the Chinese had geographical advantage. Additionally, maintaining numerous small posts would be untenable if the Chinese superior forces attacked. This was ruled out by Nehru who believed the Chinese would not attack.

This decision was endorsed by Nehru, who was in [[London]] to attend the [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. Subsequently, the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade|7th Infantry Brigade]], which included 1 Sikh, was ordered to move to [[Namka Chu]], which was considered as militarily unsound and an advantageous ground for the Chinese. This move was strongly criticized by the [[Indian media]], who publicized it with \"sensational headlines\", arguing India's military offensive capability.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=69}}\n\nThe Chinese, aware of these developments, attacked the unprepared Indian post at Namka Chu. Though the Indian troops resisted the attack, they took heavy casualties due to inadequate ammunition and weak communication lines. Soon after the attack, the Chinese advanced to [[Tawang]].

He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon's successor, [[Sennacherib]], has slain. For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him. After Sennacherib's death, Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh, where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street. That night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. His blindness subsequently leads him to falsely accuse his wife, Anna, of stealing a baby goat she had received as partial payment for work she had done.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1PhMAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA445&ots=aSMtmyd64_&dq=tobit%20false%20accusation%20kid&pg=PA446#v=onepage&q=%22falsely%20accused%20her%20of%20stealing%20a%20kid%22&f=false \"Tobit, book of\", ''Cyclop\u00e6dia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 10'']</ref> This strains his marriage and, ultimately, he prays for death.<ref name=je>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14422-tobit-book-of \"Tobit, book of\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in faraway [[Medes|Media]], a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair. The [[demon]] of lust, [[Asmodeus]] (\"the worst of demons\"), abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. God sends the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], disguised as a human, to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon.<ref name=je/>\n\nThe main narrative is dedicated to Tobit's son, Tobiah or Tobiyah (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03a4\u03c9\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}} ''Tobias''), who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog.\n\nAlong the way, while washing his feet in the river [[Tigris]], a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, he captures it and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+6&version=GNT |title= Tobit 6 GNT \u2013 Tobias Catches a Fish \u2013 So Tobias and |publisher= Bible Gateway |accessdate= 2014-03-11}}</ref>\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 147.png|thumb|right|''Tobias and Sara Sleep'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nUpon arriving in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, whom Tobias has the right to marry because he is her cousin and closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night.<ref name=Drum>{{cite book|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14749c.htm|chapter=Book of Tobias|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1909|publisher= }}</ref>\nThe two marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to [[Upper Egypt]], where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, he orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money.<ref name=Drum/>\n\nAfter the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, and Tobit sings a hymn of praise.<ref name=Drum/>\n\nTobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy (compare the [[Book of Nahum]]). After the prayer, Tobit dies at an advanced age.<ref>\nTobit's age at death is variously given as 127 years in Greek I, 117 years in Greek II and the [[Vetus Latina]], and 102 years in most manuscripts of the [[Vulgate]], 112 years in others,\n* (158) \"an hundred and eight and fifty years old\" in [[s:Bible (King James)/Tobit#14:11|Tobit 14:11 KJV]] (Wikisource)\n* (102) \"a hundred and two years\" {{bibleref|Tobit|14:2|63}} Douay-Rheims (Biblegateway)\n</ref>\nAfter burying his father and mother, Tobias returns to Media with his family.\n\n==Liturgical and religious significance==\nReadings from the book are used in the [[Latin Rite]]. Because of the book's praise for the purity of marriage, it is often read during weddings in many rites.

Tobit may have been originally composed either in [[Aramaic]] or Hebrew, since fragments of Tobit in both languages have been discovered at [[Qumran]].\n\n===Genre===\nThe book is closely related to Jewish [[wisdom literature]].

In the two Greek versions, the first two and a half chapters are written in the first person; in the [[Vulgate]] version, they are written in the third person.<ref>''Septuaginta: Editio altera/Revised Edition,'' 2006: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 1002-1039; ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata,'' vierte, verbesserte Auflage 1994: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 676-690.</ref> Tobit, raised by his paternal grandmother, Deborah, remains loyal to the worship of [[God]] at the [[temple in Jerusalem]], refusing the cult of the [[golden calf|golden calves]] that [[Jeroboam]], king of the northern kingdom of Israel, set up at [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon's successor, [[Sennacherib]], has slain. For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him. After Sennacherib's death, Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh, where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street. That night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. His blindness subsequently leads him to falsely accuse his wife, Anna, of stealing a baby goat she had received as partial payment for work she had done.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1PhMAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA445&ots=aSMtmyd64_&dq=tobit%20false%20accusation%20kid&pg=PA446#v=onepage&q=%22falsely%20accused%20her%20of%20stealing%20a%20kid%22&f=false \"Tobit, book of\", ''Cyclop\u00e6dia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 10'']</ref> This strains his marriage and, ultimately, he prays for death.<ref name=je>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14422-tobit-book-of \"Tobit, book of\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in faraway [[Medes|Media]], a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair. The [[demon]] of lust, [[Asmodeus]] (\"the worst of demons\"), abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. God sends the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], disguised as a human, to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon.<ref name=je/>\n\nThe main narrative is dedicated to Tobit's son, Tobiah or Tobiyah (Greek: {{lang|el|\u03a4\u03c9\u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}} ''Tobias''), who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog.\n\nAlong the way, while washing his feet in the river [[Tigris]], a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, he captures it and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+6&version=GNT |title= Tobit 6 GNT \u2013 Tobias Catches a Fish \u2013 So Tobias and |publisher= Bible Gateway |accessdate= 2014-03-11}}</ref>\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 147.png|thumb|right|''Tobias and Sara Sleep'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nUpon arriving in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, whom Tobias has the right to marry because he is her cousin and closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night.<ref name=Drum>{{cite book|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14749c.htm|chapter=Book of Tobias|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1909|publisher= }}</ref>\nThe two marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to [[Upper Egypt]], where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, he orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money.<ref name=Drum/>\n\nAfter the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, and Tobit sings a hymn of praise.<ref name=Drum/>\n\nTobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy (compare the [[Book of Nahum]]). After the prayer, Tobit dies at an advanced age.<ref>\nTobit's age at death is variously given as 127 years in Greek I, 117 years in Greek II and the [[Vetus Latina]], and 102 years in most manuscripts of the [[Vulgate]], 112 years in others,\n* (158) \"an hundred and eight and fifty years old\" in [[s:Bible (King James)/Tobit#14:11|Tobit 14:11 KJV]] (Wikisource)\n* (102) \"a hundred and two years\" {{bibleref|Tobit|14:2|63}} Douay-Rheims (Biblegateway)\n</ref>\nAfter burying his father and mother, Tobias returns to Media with his family.\n\n==Liturgical and religious significance==\nReadings from the book are used in the [[Latin Rite]]. Because of the book's praise for the purity of marriage, it is often read during weddings in many rites.

Also used to describe [[log building]]), '''corner post construction''', '''post-and-plank''', '''St\u00e4nderbohlenbau''' (German) and '''skiftesverk''' (Swedish). This traditional building method is believed to be the predecessor to half-timber construction widely known by its German name ''fachwerkbau'' which has wall infill of [[wattle and daub]], brick, or stone. This carpentry was used from parts of Scandinavia to Switzerland to western Russia. Though relatively rare now, two types are found in a number of regions in North America, more common are the walls with planks or timbers which slide in a groove in the posts and less common is a type where horizontal logs are tenoned into individual mortises in the posts. This method is not the same as the [[plank-frame buildings]] in North America with vertical plank walls.\n\n==Other names==\n* French: Pi\u00e8ce sur pi\u00e8ce poteaux et pi\u00e8ce coulissante (piece on piece sliding in a groove), pi\u00e8ce sur pi\u00e8ce en coulisse,  poteaux et piece coulissante, pieces sur pieces, poiteau cannale,<ref>Brumbaugh, G.

Also used to describe [[log building]]), '''corner post construction''', '''post-and-plank''', '''St\u00e4nderbohlenbau''' (German) and '''skiftesverk''' (Swedish). This traditional building method is believed to be the predecessor to half-timber construction widely known by its German name ''fachwerkbau'' which has wall infill of [[wattle and daub]], brick, or stone. This carpentry was used from parts of Scandinavia to Switzerland to western Russia. Though relatively rare now, two types are found in a number of regions in North America, more common are the walls with planks or timbers which slide in a groove in the posts and less common is a type where horizontal logs are tenoned into individual mortises in the posts. This method is not the same as the [[plank-frame buildings]] in North America with vertical plank walls.\n\n==Other names==\n* French: Pi\u00e8ce sur pi\u00e8ce poteaux et pi\u00e8ce coulissante (piece on piece sliding in a groove), pi\u00e8ce sur pi\u00e8ce en coulisse,  poteaux et piece coulissante, pieces sur pieces, poiteau cannale,<ref>Brumbaugh, G.
