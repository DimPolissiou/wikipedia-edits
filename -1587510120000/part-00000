Paddy demonstrates the dedication of the soap's writers towards maintaining a comedic tone in plotlines. While he has appeared at the centre of some grave storylines, Paddy is often a manifestation of the faintly ridiculous. His bumbling ways and perpetual ill luck act as an amusing antithesis to the sometimes traumatic incidents which befall those around him.\n\nPaddy is one of the longest-serving characters currently in the programme. He has been married three times: to [[Mandy Dingle]] ([[Lisa Riley]]) in 1999, to [[Emily Kirk|Emily Dingle]] ([[Kate McGregor]]) in 2002, and to [[Rhona Goskirk]] ([[Zoe Henry]]) in 2012. He has also had several affairs since arriving, notably with [[Viv Hope]] ([[Deena Payne]]) and [[Tess Harris]] ([[Nicola Stephenson]]). Brunt took a break from the show with Paddy departing on 18 April 2016 and returning on 29 August 2016.\n\n==Storylines==\nPaddy comes to Emmerdale as a locum for [[Zoe Tate]] ([[Leah Bracknell]]). He is drawn to [[Mandy Dingle]] ([[Lisa Riley]]) and they are smitten but their relationship is rocky. Paddy's mother, [[Barbara Kirk|Barbara]] (Judi Jones), disapproves of Mandy and offers her money to marry someone else. Needing money to stop her family from being evicted, Mandy takes it and marries her cousin, [[Butch Dingle|Butch]] ([[Paul Loughran]]), leaving Paddy depressed. After a bad date with [[Bernice Blackstock]] ([[Samantha Giles]]), Paddy proposes to Mandy and she accepts. They marry the following year but over the next two years, Mandy is frequently absent as her father, Caleb, is ill. She misses Paddy but begins an affair with her father's carer and their marriage breaks down.\n\nA heartbroken Paddy becomes close to [[Emily Dingle]] ([[Kate McGregor]]). They begin dating and later get engaged. On the day that [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and Tricia Stokes ([[Sheree Murphy]]) were supposed to marry, Tricia gets cold feet so Emily and Paddy get married instead. Their marriage is happy and they become foster parents, looking after several children including [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie Jones]] ([[Charley Webb]]) but over time, the marriage loses its spark. Emily tries to make things work but Paddy tells Emily about his affair with [[Viv Hope|Viv Windsor]] ([[Deena Payne]]), after Viv jokes to Paddy that she told Emily. When it becomes public knowledge, Paddy is punched by Viv's estranged husband, [[Bob Hope (Emmerdale)|Bob Hope]] ([[Antony Audenshaw]]) and [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]). Soon after, Emily leaves the village with Debbie's baby daughter, Sarah.\n\nPaddy begins internet dating and goes to Portugal after [[Jo Stiles]] ([[Roxanne Pallett]]), plays a practical joke by pretending to be his Internet lover Fireblade and suggesting they meet. He goes but realizes he was tricked and returns with [[Toni Daggert]] ([[Kerry Stacey]]). A horrified Jo thinks Toni wants Paddy's money and is relieved when Paddy and Toni reveal they were paying her back. Paddy later develops feelings for Toni but she didn't feel the same so he moves on and starts dating [[Del Dingle]] ([[Hayley Tamaddon]]),  making Toni realize that she is in love with Paddy. Toni tries to split them up but it fails but Paddy and Del's relationship ends after Del accidentally burns Toni with hot fat in The Woolpack kitchen. Paddy admits that he loves Toni but the relationship breaks down when Toni learns Paddy does not want to marry her.\n\nPaddy's cousin [[Ross Kirk]] ([[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]]) comes to the village. One morning, Ross accidentally hits [[Gennie Walker]] ([[Sian Reese-Williams]]), and knocks her off her moped. Gennie seems fine and Ross, afraid of losing his job, persuades Paddy to say he was responsible. Gennie soon collapses and is intensive care. Ross refuses to own up so Paddy tells Ross's colleague, [[Shane Doyle]] ([[Paul McEwan (actor)|Paul McEwan]]), what really happened. Shane convinces Paddy that he will be jailed for perverting the course of justice so he remains silent. After he learns about Ross's affair with Marlon's wife, [[Donna Windsor|Donna]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]), Paddy throws Ross out.\n\nPaddy begins a relationship with [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) and deals with her wayward son, [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]). The problems aren't helped by [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]), telling Paddy that he and Chas slept together. At first Paddy refuses to believe it, thinking that he was just stirring things but realises it is true and evicts Chas but lets Aaron stay and they build up a father-son relationship and Paddy helps Aaron come to terms with his homosexuality.\n\n[[Rhona Goskirk]] ([[Zoe Henry]]) returns to the village. She and Marlon reignite their relationship but Rhona falls in love with Paddy and ends it with Marlon. Rhona learns she is expecting Marlon's baby and he initially decides not to be part of the baby's life but has a change of heart once he learns that the baby may have Down's Syndrome. They repair their friendship and Rhona gives birth to a baby boy, Leo, in 2011. Paddy gets a job in New Zealand and Marlon decides to go too but changes his mind. The Kirks and Marlon go to court over Leo when Marlon refuses to allow them to take Leo out of the country. Paddy creates a distraction for Rhona and Leo going to New Zealand by fighting with a police officer but has to stay in the country to face charges of assaulting a police officer and his veterinary licence is suspended. This leads to the job in New Zealand being withdrawn and Marlon tells Paddy to tell Rhona to come home voluntarily or risk being arrested for not attending a court hearing and brought back under arrest. Rhona and Leo return and Rhona takes over Paddy's work and gets an old friend, [[Vanessa Woodfield]] ([[Michelle Hardwick]]), to help her. Paddy resents her for doing his job but he and Vanessa later learn to get on and Vanessa later buys a share of the business. When Paddy's suspension was over, he, Rhona and Vanessa all had their names above the door.\n\nPaddy and Rhona's marriage faces a major test after Rhona becomes addicted to the painkillers she was prescribed for a back injury. Paddy and Vanessa become worried as Rhona's mood swings are visible and matters get worse when Rhona begins buying pills from a dealer named Gary, leading her to attack Paddy physically when he confronts her. Eventually, Rhona collapses from taking too many painkillers and is rushed to hospital where she learns that her kidneys are about to collapse. Consequently, Marlon removes Leo and Rhona goes to rehab. Eventually, when Marlon is satisfied that Rhona is capable, Leo returns to live with her and Paddy.\n\nPaddy became involved in Aaron's affair with [[Robert Sugden]] ([[Ryan Hawley]]), after Aaron tells him in February 2015. Paddy and Chas tried to keep Aaron and Robert apart, with little luck. In July, Paddy was worried that Aaron and Robert were continuing their affair and found he was right when he caught them half dressed at the scrapyard. Paddy sent a note to Robert's wife, [[Chrissie White (Emmerdale)|Chrissie White]] ([[Louise Marwood]]), telling her to 'rein her cheating husband in'. While helping out at the farm, Paddy fell into a grain pit and injured his leg. Robert then turned on the grain pit to scare Paddy after he discovered that Paddy sent the note to his wife. Paddy fell unconscious and was about to drown when Robert turned the machine off and went to help, only to be scared off by [[Andy Sugden]]'s ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) approach. Paddy spent a night in hospital. He suspected Robert of being responsible and this was confirmed when Robert threatened him and his family. A while later, Paddy told Aaron so Aaron planned a night at a lodge with Robert to get him to confess. Worried what Robert might do, Paddy went to the lodge and was shot by Robert. Paddy helped Robert stitch his wound and persuaded him to let him and Aaron leave but Aaron retaliated by telling Chrissie about his affair with Robert. Paddy demanded Aaron leave Robert alone, telling him that it'd be his fault if something happened to his family.\n\nFollowing the helicopter crash, Paddy discovered Rhona and Marlon had kissed at [[Debbie Dingle]]'s ([[Charley Webb]]) wedding so he set up an online dating profile for Marlon. Marlon invites Paddy to a night out and meets a woman named [[Tess Harris]] ([[Nicola Stephenson]]). He offloads on her about the situation regarding Robert and Aaron and they end up having sex in her car. Tess turns out to be Leo's teaching assistant, who is also married. They break things off, but resume things after a short while. Feeling broody after Vanessa gives birth to her son, [[Johnny Woodfield|Johnny]], Rhona suggests to Paddy that they adopt a child and Paddy eventually agrees. Amongst others, Aaron and Tess are asked to be references for the social worker. After Tess gives her reference, she texts Paddy but Rhona finds the phone and asks why he has a second phone, Paddy says that it's Aaron's and consequently tells him about the affair. Reeling, Aaron tells the social worker that Paddy and Rhona are having marital issues. After Aaron blames Tess, she is furious and reminds Paddy that she can take everything away from him in an instant.\n\nIn February 2016, Paddy and the Dingles are informed by Cain, that Aaron was sexually abused as a child by his father, [[Gordon Livesy|Gordon]] ([[Gary Mavers]]). Tess and Paddy's affair comes to an abrupt end when a drunken [[Kirin Kotecha]] (Adam Fielding) accidentally kills her. Tess dies during surgery. Rhona learns about the affair after Paddy goes to Tess's funeral but is spotted by [[Megan Macey]] ([[Gaynor Faye]]). After a series of rows, which includes Paddy telling Rhona about Aaron and Robert's affair, nearly dying in the grain pit, getting shot by Robert and also revealing that Robert killed [[Katie Sugden]] ([[Sammy Winward]]), Rhona decides that the conversation never happened and that they should continue as normal. Unfortunately they try to make it work but Rhona is haunted by the extent of Paddy's deceit and cannot forgive him so they agree that he should take a new job in Germany and cancel the adoption plans.\n\nIn October, he is involved in a car pile up, caused by [[Emma Barton (Emmerdale)|Emma Barton]] ([[Gillian Kearney]]) pushing her husband [[James Barton (Emmerdale)|James Barton]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) off a bridge along with several other villagers, such as Rhona and Paddy is badly injured but asks Pierce to help him survive which he does, but in the ambulance, tells him if Rhona doesn't survive then Paddy will suffer. Paddy watches as Rhona gets more and more involved with Pierce but every time someone suggests to Rhona that Pierce isn't quite what he seems to be, she refuses to listen. As they still work together, Pierce reluctantly accepts that Paddy is still part of Rhona's life but when he learns that Rhona and Paddy kissed just before his and Rhona's wedding, he confronts her on their wedding night and rapes her. Rhona reports Pierce to the police but Pierce initially convinces him and Marlon that she's back on the painkillers and making up stories about him to cover herself but Rhona and Vanessa tell them the truth. Disgusted, Paddy and Marlon support Rhona.\n\nPaddy and Chas rekindle their relationship. In early 2018, Chas learns that she is pregnant.\n\n==Reception==\nBrunt was nominated in the category of \"Best Actor\" at the 2011 [[British Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|title=British Soap Awards 2011 voting opens|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=7 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x0jSLWib?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|url-status=live|archivedate=7 March 2011 }}</ref> In August 2017, Brunt was longlisted for Funniest Male at the [[Inside Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harp|first1=Justin|title=Coronation Street, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks all make the Inside Soap Awards longlist|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a836154/inside-soap-awards-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|accessdate=22 August 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=22 August 2017}}</ref> He later made the viewer-voted shortlist.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Inside Soap Awards 2017 shortlist revealed \u2013 which Corrie, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks stars are up for prizes?|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a841879/inside-soap-awards-2017-shortlist/|accessdate=31 October 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=31 October 2017}}</ref> On 6 November 2017, Brunt won the \"Funniest Male\" accolade.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Emmerdale wins best soap at the Inside Soap Awards for the third year running|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a842388/emmerdale-wins-best-soap-inside-soap-awards/|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=6 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/paddy Paddy Kirk] at [[itv.com]]\n\n{{Emmerdale characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirk, Paddy}}\n[[Category:Emmerdale characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional veterinarians]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1997]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2013}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{In-universe|subject = television|category = television|date = October 2009}}\n{{Tone|date=December 2007}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2016}}\n}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|image = Paddy Kirk.jpg\n|imagesize = 200px\n|name = Paddy Kirk\n|portrayer = [[Dominic Brunt]]\n|first = Episode 2169 <br /> {{Start date|1997|02|20|df=y}}\n|last =\n|years = 1997\u2013\n|introducer = Mervyn Watson\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Present cast|Present; regular]]\n|spinoffs = ''The Dingles in Venice'' (1999)<br />''Paddy and Marlon's Big Night In'' (2011)\n|home = The Woolpack\n|occupation = Veterinary surgeon\n|father = [[Bear Wolf (Emmerdale)|Bear Wolf]]\n|adoptivefather = Kenneth Kirk\n|mother = [[Barbara Kirk]]\n|wife = {{plainlist|\n*[[Mandy Dingle]] {{nowrap|(1999\u20132001)}}\n*[[Emily Kirk|Emily Dingle]] (2002\u20132006)\n*[[Rhona Goskirk]] {{nowrap|(2012\u20132017)}}\n}}\n|halfbrothers = Colin Kirk\n|daughters = [[Grace Dingle]]<br> [[List of Emmerdale characters (2019)#Eve Dingle|Eve Dingle]]\n|adoptivesons = [[Aaron Livesy]] \n|stepsons = [[Leo Goskirk]]\n|cousins = [[Jason Kirk]]<br />[[Ross Kirk]]\n}}\n'''Patrick \"Paddy\" Kirk''' is a fictional character from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Dominic Brunt]].

In an artfully constructed depiction of how Europe is sleepwalking toward disaster, starring Angus Deayton in fiction scenes from a postEU future, the film pairs an imagined view from a dystopian future with insightful, cross national analysis by ordinary Europeans and high level experts on how and why things are going so wrong. Notable interviewees include French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Martin Wolf]], chief economic commentator at the Financial Times, former EU trade commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]], and many former ministers and high level EU officials in various European countries.\n\nIn an authored piece of committed journalism, the filmmakers argue powerfully that, while economic crisis and popular anger are pushing Europe dangerously towards disintegration, the EU is in need of major reform but well worth saving. Subtle, moving, thought provoking and witty, \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d is far more than a political film but instead frames Europe through the eyes of those who are most important to its success: the Europeans themselves.\n\n'''Reception'''\n\nThe Great European Disaster Movie is a BBC/ARTE and 7 other European broadcasters coproduction, which has now been watched by 2.360.000 viewers, one million of which in France and Germany.

The film is an unique document to analyses Europe's role on the global stage in light of today's challenges from the perspective of the person called upon to implement a shared European vision, which is sorely elusive.\n\nPiras is a regular member of the BBC ''[[Dateline London]]'' panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isthebbcbiased.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/dateline-guest-of-dishonour.html|title=Dateline Guests}}</ref>\nShe also provided [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/piras-annalisa analysis] on European and Italian Current Affairs for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/piras-annalisa}}</ref>\n\nAs a political and social commentator she frequently appears on BBC News, Sky News, CNN, Al Jazeera and CNBC.\n\n== Girlfriend in a Coma ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn 2012 Annalisa Piras produced, co-wrote and directed the first independent feature documentary on Italy as seen from abroad, Girlfriend in a Coma,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://girlfriendinacoma.eu|title=Girlfriend In A Coma website}}</ref> working with Bill Emmott, former editor of The Economist, as co-author and narrator.<ref>''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2315588/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2 \"Girlfriend in a Coma\"]'', IMDb, imdb.com, May 29, 2015</ref> The film was made by Springshot Productions.\n\nThe documentary is inspired by Emmott\u2019s book Good Italy, Bad Italy (Yale University Press), as well as by Piras\u2019s patriotic passion and insight about the country she left in the early 1990s.\nThe film aims to introduce Italians and the World to the dark side of the country's political, economic and social decline, the product of a moral collapse in the West. It was broadcast on BBC Four, Sky Italia and La7 TV channels early in 2013, and subsequently on other channels worldwide as well as in public screenings. https://uniondocs.org/event/2013-10-13-girlfriend-in-a-coma/\n\n\nThe \u201cGirlfriend in a Coma\u201d title is a citation of a British musical hit by The Smiths from their album Strangeways (1987).\n\n== The Great European Disaster Movie ==\n\nIn 2014 Annalisa Piras wrote, directed and produced with [[Bill Emmott]] the documentary  \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d on the crisis of the [[European Union]]. In an artfully constructed depiction of how Europe is sleepwalking toward disaster, starring Angus Deayton in fiction scenes from a postEU future, the film pairs an imagined view from a dystopian future with insightful, cross national analysis by ordinary Europeans and high level experts on how and why things are going so wrong. Notable interviewees include French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Martin Wolf]], chief economic commentator at the Financial Times, former EU trade commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]], and many former ministers and high level EU officials in various European countries.\n\nIn an authored piece of committed journalism, the filmmakers argue powerfully that, while economic crisis and popular anger are pushing Europe dangerously towards disintegration, the EU is in need of major reform but well worth saving. Subtle, moving, thought provoking and witty, \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d is far more than a political film but instead frames Europe through the eyes of those who are most important to its success: the Europeans themselves.\n\n'''Reception'''\n\nThe Great European Disaster Movie is a BBC/ARTE and 7 other European broadcasters coproduction, which has now been watched by 2.360.000 viewers, one million of which in France and Germany. The film premi\u00e8red on BBC Four, as part of the Storyville strand, on 1 March 2015. It was subsequently broadcast in 12 countries (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Japan) and has been translated in 10 languages, including Japanese.\n\n\u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d has won the prestigious German CIVIS media prize in the information category. The film has been selected among 930 applications by media programmes from all over Europe. The prize was bestowed by the German Federal President Joachim Gauck and the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz at a star studded event in the German Federal Foreign Office in Berlin in the presence of EU broadcasters yesterday evening May 12.

The BBC broadcast was followed by a live studio debate on Newsnight, the BBC\u2019s news and current affairs programme, during which exec producer Bill Emmott faced several prominent eurosceptic critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishinfluence.org/the_great_european_disaster_movie_was_meant_to_stimulate_robust_debate_on_europe_s_future_what_we_got_was_a_theological_war|title=The Great European Disaster Movie was meant to stimulate robust debate on Europe's future.

After the death of a prominent white man Will Taylor was discovered, all the other white men pledged to go and murder every single man in the Coe Ridge Colony. The residents of the Coe Ridge Colony learned of this pledge and defended themselves by leaving their homes in the middle of the night, which the white folk were ready to set on fire with everyone inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> Upon returning to the Coe Ridge Colony, residents were assigned shifts to protect the borders of the colony against further attacks. Tensions eventually calmed down, though the arrival of more divorced/disenfranchised white women to the Coe Ridge Colony would temporarily flare tensions once again. As the Chestnut trees were lost to the blight, and the Coe Ridge Colony turned to [[Moonshine|moonshining]] and bootlegging, the colony became a riotous place to live.

[[Moonshine|Moonshining]] and bootlegging were major factors in the extinction of the colony. Judge Wells was the first county law official to confront the Coe Ridge Colony residents about their riotous living, and stated that whiskey was the root of their problem.<ref name=\":1\" /> Moonshining was such an integral part of the culture of Coe Ridge Colony that even the women and children were part of the moonshining business.<ref name=\":1\" /> Children were taught to make whiskey at an early age. The Cumberland County Sheriff Department led frequent raids against the Coe Ridge Colony moonshiners, to the great displeasure of those involved in the moonshinig business. The Coe Ridge Colony residents developed a warning system as a means of notifying each other when Law Enforcement officers were nearby, using the catch-phrase \u201cPig oooey, Pig oooey\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, despite their best efforts, the moonshiners in Coe Ridge Colony steadily were eradicated. Without any real means of income, residents turned to burglary. However, thieves were often caught, and when caught were punished with exile from the colony, and a warning to never return. A lack of economical resources, a propensity for crime, and a tendency of neighboring communities towards blatant persecution drove out all of the residents of Coe Ridge Colony. Only three houses remain on the 300 acres of Coe Ridge, slowly being reclaimed by the wilderness surrounding it, and forgotten in the annals of history.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Carlton|date=1971|title=Review of The Saga of Coe Ridge: A Study in Oral History|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42623234|journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=228\u2013230|issn=0040-3261}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of Coe Ridge Colony ==\nThe history of Coe Ridge Colony is an example of a multi-racial community in a time where racial tensions were high, and co-existence seemed nearly impossible.

A massive fight broke out between the members of Coe Ridge Colony and their white neighbors. Members of both sides were killed in the fight, and it eventually calmed down as each side returned to their homes to lick their wounds. After the death of a prominent white man Will Taylor was discovered, all the other white men pledged to go and murder every single man in the Coe Ridge Colony. The residents of the Coe Ridge Colony learned of this pledge and defended themselves by leaving their homes in the middle of the night, which the white folk were ready to set on fire with everyone inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> Upon returning to the Coe Ridge Colony, residents were assigned shifts to protect the borders of the colony against further attacks. Tensions eventually calmed down, though the arrival of more divorced/disenfranchised white women to the Coe Ridge Colony would temporarily flare tensions once again. As the Chestnut trees were lost to the blight, and the Coe Ridge Colony turned to [[Moonshine|moonshining]] and bootlegging, the colony became a riotous place to live. Alcholism, murder, and violence became commonplace even amongst the members of the Coe Ridge Colony themselves.<ref name=\":1\" />[[File:Four African American men lynched on the \"old proctor lynching tree\" where \"a total of nine men lynched on this tree\" \"taken at dawn August 1, '08\" at \"Russellville, Logan County, Kentucky\"- (NBY 4084) (cropped).jpg|thumb|An example of the extreme actions taking by racist groups and people during this time <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Keil|first=Thomas J.|last2=Vito|first2=Gennaro F.|date=2009-03-20|title=Lynching and the Death Penalty in Kentucky, 1866\u20131934: Substitution or Supplement?|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15377930802711813|journal=Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=53\u201368|doi=10.1080/15377930802711813|issn=1537-7938}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kleber|first=John E.|date=1992|title=Myth and Reality in Kentucky History|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23382494|journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society|volume=90|issue=1|pages=45\u201363|issn=0023-0243}}</ref> |link=File:Four_African_American_men_lynched_on_the_%22old_proctor_lynching_tree%22_where_%22a_total_of_nine_men_lynched_on_this_tree%22_%22taken_at_dawn_August_1,_'08%22_at_%22Russellville,_Logan_County,_Kentucky%22-_(NBY_4084)_(cropped).jpg|alt=]]\n\n=== The Decline of Coe Ridge Colony: 1911-1958 ===\nBy 1904, residents of Coe Ridge Colony had established their reputation as moonshiners and by the 1920-30s rumors spread that the Coe Ridge residents were fighting amongst themselves and killing members of their own races. [[Moonshine|Moonshining]] and bootlegging were major factors in the extinction of the colony. Judge Wells was the first county law official to confront the Coe Ridge Colony residents about their riotous living, and stated that whiskey was the root of their problem.<ref name=\":1\" /> Moonshining was such an integral part of the culture of Coe Ridge Colony that even the women and children were part of the moonshining business.<ref name=\":1\" /> Children were taught to make whiskey at an early age. The Cumberland County Sheriff Department led frequent raids against the Coe Ridge Colony moonshiners, to the great displeasure of those involved in the moonshinig business. The Coe Ridge Colony residents developed a warning system as a means of notifying each other when Law Enforcement officers were nearby, using the catch-phrase \u201cPig oooey, Pig oooey\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, despite their best efforts, the moonshiners in Coe Ridge Colony steadily were eradicated. Without any real means of income, residents turned to burglary. However, thieves were often caught, and when caught were punished with exile from the colony, and a warning to never return. A lack of economical resources, a propensity for crime, and a tendency of neighboring communities towards blatant persecution drove out all of the residents of Coe Ridge Colony. Only three houses remain on the 300 acres of Coe Ridge, slowly being reclaimed by the wilderness surrounding it, and forgotten in the annals of history.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Carlton|date=1971|title=Review of The Saga of Coe Ridge: A Study in Oral History|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42623234|journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=228\u2013230|issn=0040-3261}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of Coe Ridge Colony ==\nThe history of Coe Ridge Colony is an example of a multi-racial community in a time where racial tensions were high, and co-existence seemed nearly impossible. [[Lynching in the United States|Lynching]], the [[Ku Klux Klan|Klu Klux Klan]], and other forms/groups of racial persecution raged across the entire United States of America, and more specifically across Kentucky.<ref name=\":3\" /> The unique mix of previously enslaved African Americans, Native Americans, and disenfranchised white women was a very rare occurrence during this time period. In a time when separate but equal [[Apartheid|segregation]] was legalized, Coe Ridge Colony showed that different races could live together in harmony.<ref name=\":6\" /> While this harmony didn't last (due to economic collapse, lack of local justice system, and external persecution),<ref name=\":1\" /> Coe Ridge colony proved that interracial harmony wasn't an impossible feat. Additionally, while the persecution of the residents of Coe Ridge Colony was despicable, it added another case to the ever increasing list of white persecution and oppression against minorities in the United States.<ref name=\":4\" /> These instances would prove essential in the battle for racial equality and protecting minority groups from blatant persecution.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Djgonzophd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coe_Ridge_Colony"}
