The film stars [[Emma Roberts]], [[Dave Franco]] and [[Juliette Lewis]], and revolves around an online objective [[truth or dare]] online game, which allows people to enlist as \"players\" or \"watchers\" and  as the game progresses further, the players are contacted and invited to participate in more dangerous and risky dares than their prior ones.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[School of Visual Arts|SVA Theater]] on July 12, 2016<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Photos/Nerve-premieres-in-New-York-City/10392/|title='Nerve' premieres in New York City (NYC) - Photos|date=July 13, 2016|agency=[[United Press International]]|access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref> and was theatrically released on July 27, 2016, by [[Lionsgate]].

Her friend Sydney becomes popular in ''Nerve'': an online reality game where people either enlist as \"players\" or register to watch as \"watchers\". Players accept dares as they're invited by watchers and receive monetary rewards if they successfully complete those dares.\n\nSydney chastises Vee's unadventurous nature so Vee signs up as a player, learning that all dares must be recorded on the player's phone, earned money will be revoked if a player fails or bails on a dare, and that \"snitches get stitches.\" \n\nVee's first dare is to kiss a stranger at a [[diner]]. At the diner she kisses Ian, who dances and sings to Vee, revealing he's another player on a dare. The watchers dare Ian to take her into [[Manhattan]] on his motorcycle.\n\nIn Manhattan they are dared to try on expensive [[formal attire]]. Their street clothes are stolen and the watchers dare them to leave the store, so they flee in their [[undergarments]]. They return to Ian's motorbike where they find the expensive clothes paid for by the watchers.\n\nVee is dared to get a [[tattoo]] chosen by Ian, and Ian is dared to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60&nbsp;mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian become among ''Nerve''{{'}}s top players.\n\nJealous of Vee's popularity, Sydney accepts a dare at a party to cross a ladder between two buildings. Sydney bails and is eliminated from the game. Vee catches Sydney making out with J.P., a boy Vee likes. Vee and Sydney have a major argument. Tommy reveals that he was watching Ian's profile; Ian had accepted a dare to make Vee and Sydney fight. Vee completes the ladder dare herself.  Realizing that game players could die, she reports the game to a policeman but he doesn\u2019t believe her. As punishment for \"snitching\", all the money in her family\u2019s bank accounts vanishes. Highly ranked player Ty accepts a dare to knock her unconscious.\n\nVee wakes up in a [[Intermodal container|shipping container]] with \"snitches get stitches\" on the walls. She escapes and finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend was killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were confiscated. Vee has now joined them in the secret third category of the game: \"prisoners\". If a prisoner can reach and win the day\u2019s final round, they regain everything.\n\nVee, Tommy, and Sydney recruit Tommy's [[hacker]] friends to alter the game's online code, but it is impossible to simply shut down ''Nerve'', as all the watchers phones act as a [[Distributed computing|distributed server]].\n\nVee and Ian earn the two spots in the final dare, which takes place at [[Battery Weed]]. The winner will be whoever shoots the other with the handguns they\u2019ve been given. Ian offers her the win, but when she also refuses to shoot, Ty jumps from the audience to take Ian's place and shoots her, and she dies in Ian's arms.\n\nJust then, Tommy and his hackers modify ''Nerve''{{'}}s source code to decrypt the watcher's code names and send them all a message: \"You are an accessory to murder\". All watchers immediately log out, closing down the game's servers and effectively ending it. Ian aims his gun at Ty and Vee suddenly sits up, revealing that she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding ''Nerve''. Tommy's hacker friends restore the stolen money and identities.\n\nA few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Vee and Ian are a couple, and Vee is attending California Arts. Ian reveals his real name to be Sam whilst another person is secretly recording them on their phone.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n<!--order, names, character names per closing credits-->\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Vee, a player of ''Nerve''.\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Ian / Sam, Vee's fellow player.\n* [[Emily Meade]] as Sydney, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Miles Heizer]] as Tommy, one of Vee's friends who has an unrequited crush on her.\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Nancy, Vee's mother.\n* [[Kimiko Glenn]] as Liv, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Marc John Jefferies]] as Wes\n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Ty, Vee's main opponent in the game.\n* Brian Marc as J.P.\n* Ed Squires as Chuck\n* [[Samira Wiley]] as Hacker Kween, one of Tommy\u2019s hacker friends.\n*[[Casey Neistat]] as himself, another player.\n*[[Chloe Wise]] as herself, another player.{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirectors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost had previously dealt with similar themes in their documentary ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]''.<ref name=\"screenrantinterview\">{{cite web|last1=Puchko|first1=Kristy|title=Nerve Directors On Technology Advancements & Future Projects|url=http://screenrant.com/nerve-movie-interview-henry-joost-ariel-schulman/|website=Screenrant|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> On their attraction to a film based around the Internet, they stated, \"Most things aren\u2019t black and white.

Her friend Sydney becomes popular in ''Nerve'': an online reality game where people either enlist as \"players\" or register to watch as \"watchers\". Players accept dares as they're invited by watchers and receive monetary rewards if they successfully complete those dares.\n\nSydney chastises Vee's unadventurous nature so Vee signs up as a player, learning that all dares must be recorded on the player's phone, earned money will be revoked if a player fails or bails on a dare, and that \"snitches get stitches.\" \n\nVee's first dare is to kiss a stranger at a [[diner]]. At the diner she kisses Ian, who dances and sings to Vee, revealing he's another player on a dare. The watchers dare Ian to take her into [[Manhattan]] on his motorcycle.\n\nIn Manhattan they are dared to try on expensive [[formal attire]]. Their street clothes are stolen and the watchers dare them to leave the store, so they flee in their [[undergarments]]. They return to Ian's motorbike where they find the expensive clothes paid for by the watchers.\n\nVee is dared to get a [[tattoo]] chosen by Ian, and Ian is dared to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60&nbsp;mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian become among ''Nerve''{{'}}s top players.\n\nJealous of Vee's popularity, Sydney accepts a dare at a party to cross a ladder between two buildings. Sydney bails and is eliminated from the game. Vee catches Sydney making out with J.P., a boy Vee likes. Vee and Sydney have a major argument. Tommy reveals that he was watching Ian's profile; Ian had accepted a dare to make Vee and Sydney fight. Vee completes the ladder dare herself.  Realizing that game players could die, she reports the game to a policeman but he doesn\u2019t believe her. As punishment for \"snitching\", all the money in her family\u2019s bank accounts vanishes. Highly ranked player Ty accepts a dare to knock her unconscious.\n\nVee wakes up in a [[Intermodal container|shipping container]] with \"snitches get stitches\" on the walls. She escapes and finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend was killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were confiscated. Vee has now joined them in the secret third category of the game: \"prisoners\". If a prisoner can reach and win the day\u2019s final round, they regain everything.\n\nVee, Tommy, and Sydney recruit Tommy's [[hacker]] friends to alter the game's online code, but it is impossible to simply shut down ''Nerve'', as all the watchers phones act as a [[Distributed computing|distributed server]].\n\nVee and Ian earn the two spots in the final dare, which takes place at [[Battery Weed]]. The winner will be whoever shoots the other with the handguns they\u2019ve been given. Ian offers her the win, but when she also refuses to shoot, Ty jumps from the audience to take Ian's place and shoots her, and she dies in Ian's arms.\n\nJust then, Tommy and his hackers modify ''Nerve''{{'}}s source code to decrypt the watcher's code names and send them all a message: \"You are an accessory to murder\". All watchers immediately log out, closing down the game's servers and effectively ending it. Ian aims his gun at Ty and Vee suddenly sits up, revealing that she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding ''Nerve''. Tommy's hacker friends restore the stolen money and identities.\n\nA few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Vee and Ian are a couple, and Vee is attending California Arts. Ian reveals his real name to be Sam whilst another person is secretly recording them on their phone.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n<!--order, names, character names per closing credits-->\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Vee, a player of ''Nerve''.\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Ian / Sam, Vee's fellow player.\n* [[Emily Meade]] as Sydney, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Miles Heizer]] as Tommy, one of Vee's friends who has an unrequited crush on her.\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Nancy, Vee's mother.\n* [[Kimiko Glenn]] as Liv, one of Vee's friends.\n* [[Marc John Jefferies]] as Wes\n* [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Colson Baker]] as Ty, Vee's main opponent in the game.\n* Brian Marc as J.P.\n* Ed Squires as Chuck\n* [[Samira Wiley]] as Hacker Kween, one of Tommy\u2019s hacker friends.\n*[[Casey Neistat]] as himself, another player.\n*[[Chloe Wise]] as herself, another player.{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirectors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost had previously dealt with similar themes in their documentary ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]''.<ref name=\"screenrantinterview\">{{cite web|last1=Puchko|first1=Kristy|title=Nerve Directors On Technology Advancements & Future Projects|url=http://screenrant.com/nerve-movie-interview-henry-joost-ariel-schulman/|website=Screenrant|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> On their attraction to a film based around the Internet, they stated, \"Most things aren\u2019t black and white.

In the [[Globalization|globalized world]] of today, the creation and consumption of music through satellite TV or on the Internet is a driving force for cultural change in Sudan, popular with local audiences as well as with [[:Category:Sudanese diaspora|Sudanese living abroad]].   \n\nEven after the secession of [[South Sudan]] in 2011, the [[Sudan]] of today is very diverse, with [[Sudan#Ethnic groups|five hundred plus ethnic groups]] spread across the country's territory, which makes it the third largest country in Africa.

Thus, it has a rich and very diverse musical culture, ranging from traditional folk music to Sudanese popular urban music of the 20th century and up to the internationally influenced [[African pop music|African popular music]] of today. Despite religious and cultural objections towards music and dance in public life, musical traditions have always enjoyed great popularity with most Sudanese. Even during times of wide-ranging restrictions of public life, public concerts or the celebration of weddings and other social events, music and dance have always been part of cultural life in Sudan.\n  \nFor music in [[South Sudan]], which was a part of Sudan until 2011, see the main article'': [[Culture of South Sudan]]''\n\n{{Further|List of Sudanese singers}}\n\n== Folk music and other traditional musical forms ==\n[[File:Sudanese Traditional music instrument.JPG|thumb|A man playing traditional Sudanese drums.]]\n{{Further|Sub-Saharan African music traditions}}\n\n=== Rural traditional music and dance ===\nAs in other African regions, the traditional musical styles of Sudan are ancient, rich and diverse, with different [[Regions of Africa|regions]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] having many distinct musical traditions.

As Sudan was administered as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]] from 1899 to 1955, [[Marching band#Military Style|British military bands]] have left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]] or even the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s. Until today, these marching bands represent a characteristic element in the parades for [[History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|Independence Day]] or other official celebrations.\n\n==The 1920s - Haqibah and the origins of modern Sudanese music==\nModern Sudanese music has its roots in [[haqibah]] style music (pronounced ''hagee-ba'' and meaning ''\"briefcase\"''). It originated in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Islamic praise of the prophet, known as [[madeeh]]. Haqibah is essentially a [[harmonic]] vocal style, with percussion coming from the [[tambourine]]-like [[riq]] and from other instruments. Occasionally, tonal instruments such as the [[piano]] and the [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]] (a stringed instrument) are used.\n\n{{Quote|text=The original Briefcase (translated from the Arabic El Haqiba), is a large and somewhat ill-defined collection of Sudanese songs from the mid 20th century, combining strong words and songs by both Sudanese and non-Sudanese poets and musicians. The name comes from the briefcase that the radio presenter Ahmed Osman used to carry the records in and from which he selected the different tracks to play on his radio show back in the 1920s.

This period was marked by the introduction of tonal instruments from both East and West, such as the [[violin]], [[accordion]], [[oud]], [[tabla]] and [[bongo drum|bongo]]. A [[big band]] style came into existence, mirroring trends in the [[Western world|West]]. Post-haqibah, like haqibah, was based on the [[pentatonic]] scale.

Al Kashif began to sing under the influence of Haj Mohamed Ahmed Sarour and relied on what the pioneer of Sudanese singing Abdel-Karim Karouma had started, renewing these popular singing styles.

As Sudan was administered as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]] from 1899 to 1955, [[Marching band#Military Style|British military bands]] have left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]] or even the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s. Until today, these marching bands represent a characteristic element in the parades for [[History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|Independence Day]] or other official celebrations.\n\n==The 1920s - Haqibah and the origins of modern Sudanese music==\nModern Sudanese music has its roots in [[haqibah]] style music (pronounced ''hagee-ba'' and meaning ''\"briefcase\"''). It originated in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Islamic praise of the prophet, known as [[madeeh]]. Haqibah is essentially a [[harmonic]] vocal style, with percussion coming from the [[tambourine]]-like [[riq]] and from other instruments. Occasionally, tonal instruments such as the [[piano]] and the [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]] (a stringed instrument) are used.\n\n{{Quote|text=The original Briefcase (translated from the Arabic El Haqiba), is a large and somewhat ill-defined collection of Sudanese songs from the mid 20th century, combining strong words and songs by both Sudanese and non-Sudanese poets and musicians. The name comes from the briefcase that the radio presenter Ahmed Osman used to carry the records in and from which he selected the different tracks to play on his radio show back in the 1920s.

This period was marked by the introduction of tonal instruments from both East and West, such as the [[violin]], [[accordion]], [[oud]], [[tabla]] and [[bongo drum|bongo]]. A [[big band]] style came into existence, mirroring trends in the [[Western world|West]]. Post-haqibah, like haqibah, was based on the [[pentatonic]] scale.  Haqibah mixed with Egyptian and European elements is called ''al-aghani al-hadith''(modern songs).\n\nThe 1940s saw an influx of new names due to the rise of live radio shows at Radio Omdurman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.voanews.com/music-time-in-africa/2009/12/16/the-golden-era-of-omdurman-songs/|title=The Golden Era of Omdurman Songs \u00ab Music Time in Africa|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Early performers included Ismail Abdul Mennen, Hassan Atya, and Ahmed al Mustafa. Ismael Abdul Queen was a pioneer who strived to adapt to the new conditions and deserted the old style. He was followed by a singer-songwriter called Ahmed Ibrahim Falah. But both were soon overtaken by [[Ibrahim al Kashif]], who became known as the \"Father of modern singing\". Al Kashif began to sing under the influence of Haj Mohamed Ahmed Sarour and relied on what the pioneer of Sudanese singing Abdel-Karim Karouma had started, renewing these popular singing styles. For live performances, there were also two dance halls in Khartoum, St James' and the Gordon Music Hall.\n\n== The 1960s up to the 1980s - International influence of Western and African pop music ==\n\nStarting his career in the late 1950s, the Nubian singer, songwriter and instrumentalist [[Mohammed Wardi]] became one of Sudan's first [[Superstar|superstars]].

The lyrics were also poetic and popular. Up to the 2010s, Sharhabil's band has been one of the leading names in Sudanese music, performing both at home as well as internationally.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, female singers became socially acceptable with the rise of Mihera bint Abboud, Um el Hassan el Shaygiya and [[Aisha Musa Ahmad|Aisha al Falatiya]], who as early as 1943 was the first woman to sing on Sudanese radio.

Currently the largest of the Formosan languages, it is spoken from [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in the north to [[Taitung City|Taitung]] in the south, with another population near the southern end of the island, though the northern varieties are considered to be separate languages.\n\nGovernment services in counties where many [[Amis people]] live in Taiwan, such as the Hualien and Taitung railway stations, broadcast in Amis alongside Mandarin. However, few Amis under the age of 20 in 1995 spoke the language, and it is not known how many of the 138,000 ethnic Amis are speakers.\n\n==Dialects==\nAmis is a [[dialect cluster]]. There are five dialects, Southern Amis, Tavalong-Vataan, Central Amis, Chengkung-Kwangshan, and Northern Amis (Nanshi Amis, which includes Nataoran).\n\n[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]] is a moribund language spoken among the northernmost ethnic Amis but is mutually unintelligible with the Northern Amis dialect.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following discussion covers the central dialect of Amis (Maddieson & Wright).\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximants]]\n| w || || || j || || ||\n|}\n\nThe voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k \u02a1/}} and the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} are [[Unreleased stop|released]] in clusters, so that ''cecay'' \"one\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u1d4at\u0361saj]}}; as is {{IPA|/s/}}: ''sepat'' \"four\" is {{IPA|[s\u1d4apat\u02b0]}}. The glottal stop is an exception, frequently having no audible release in final position. The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] fricatives, {{IPA|/v \u026e \u0263/}} (the latter found only in loanwords) are devoiced to {{IPA|[f \u026c x]}} in utterance-final and sometimes initial position. {{IPA|/\u026e/}} may be [[interdental]] or post-dental. The sibilants, {{IPA|/t\u0361s s/}}, are optionally palatalized ({{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255 \u0255]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in word-initial position. {{IPA|/\u027a/}} is often post-alveolar, and in final position it is released: {{IPA|[\u02a1u\u02a1u\u027a\u0320\u1d4a]}} \"fog\".\n\n{{IPA|/\u026e/}} shows dramatic dialectical variation. In [[Fengbin, Hualien|Fengbin]], a town in the center of Amis territory, it is pronounced as a [[Central consonant|central]] dental fricative, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}}, whereas in the town of Kangko, only {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away, it is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u032a]}}. In Northern Amis, it is a plosive {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}, which may be laxed to {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}} intervocalically. The epiglottals are also reported to have different pronunciations in the north, but the descriptions are contradictory. In Central Amis, {{IPA|/\u029c/}} is always voiceless and {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} is often accompanied by vibrations that suggest it involves an epiglottal trill {{IPAblink|\u02a2}}. Edmondson and Elsing report that these are true epiglottals initially and medially, but in utterance-final position they are [[epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto\u2013pharyngeal]].\n\nSakizaya, considered to be a separate language, contrasts a voiced {{IPA|/z/}} with voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\nIn the practical orthography, {{IPA|/ts/}} is written {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} {{angle bracket|'}}, {{IPA|/\u0294/}} {{angle bracket|^}}, {{IPA|/\u026e/}} {{angle bracket|d}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} {{angle bracket|ng}}, and {{IPA|/\u029c/}} {{angle bracket|x}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !! Front !! Central !! Back\n|-\n! Closed\n| i ||   || u\n|-\n! Mid\n|   || (\u0259\u0306) || \n|-\n! Open\n|  || a ||\n|}\n\nAmis has three common vowels, {{IPA|/i a u/}}. Despite the fact that a great deal of latitude is afforded by only needing to distinguish three vowels, Amis vowels stay close to their cardinal values, though there is more movement of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} toward each other (tending to the {{IPA|[o]}} range) than there is in front-vowel space (in the {{IPA|[e]}} range).\n\nA voiceless epenthetic schwa optionally breaks up consonant clusters, as noted above. However, there are a small number of words where a short schwa (written ''e)'' may be phonemic. However, no contrast involving the schwa is known, and if it is also epenthetic, then Amis has words with no phonemic vowels at all. Examples of this ''e'' are ''malmes'' \"sad\", pronounced {{IPA|[ma\u027a\u0259\u0306m\u02d0\u0259\u0306s]}}, and ''\u2019nem'' \"six\", pronounced {{IPA|[\u02a1n\u0259\u0306m]}} or {{IPA|[\u02a1\u0259\u0306n\u0259\u0306m]}}.\n\n== Examples of words ==\n{|width=\"100%\"|\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*lotong: monkey/ape\n*fafoy: pig\n*wacu: dog\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*cecay: one\n*tosa: two\n*tolo: three\n*sepat: four\n*lima: five\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*enem: six\n*pito: seven\n*falo: eight\n*siwa: nine\n*polo': ten\n|-\n|}\n\n* Compare with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] baboy (pig), tatlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anim (6), pito (7), walo (8)\n* Compare with [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] asu (dog), atlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anam (6), pitu/pito (7), walu/walo (8), siyam (9), apulu/apulo (10) and ama (father) and ima (mother)\n* Compare with [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] baboy(pig), aso (dog), maysa (1), dua (2), tallo (3), uppat (4), lima (5), inem (6), pito (7), walo (8), siam (9), sangapulo  (10)\n* Compare with Javanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), asu (dog), siji (1), loro (2), telu (3), papat (4), lima (5), enem (6), pitu (7), wolu (8), sanga (9), sepuluh (10)\n* Compare with Sundanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), hiji (1), dua (2), tilu (3), opat (4), lima (5), genep (6), tujuh (7), dalapan (8), salapan (9), sapuluh (10)\n* Compare with [[Malay language|Malay]] lotong (monkey), babi (pig), satu (1), dua (2), telu (3), empat (4), lima (5), enam (6), sembilan (9), sepuluh (10)\n*maolah kako mimali = I like to play sports.\n*takaraw ko pita\u2019kod = I jump very high.\n*kalamkam ko kacomikay = I run very fast.\n*Ira ko tata\u2019angay a mata ako = I have big eyes\n*mamangay a ngoyos\u2019= A small mouth\n*takaya\u2019ay a fokes = long hair\n*sowal san ko kahacecay a tamdaw makapahay kako = Everyone tells me that I am beautiful.\n*mafana\u2019ay miasik, misawsaw to kaysing, milidong to fodoy = I can sweep the floor, wash dishes and clothing.\n*maolah midemak kako to tayal no loma\u2019 = I love to do household chores.\n*nawhani maolah kako to loma\u2019 no mako = Because I love my home.\n\n==Grammar==\nVerbs in the Amis language have some inflections including [[existential clause]], [[active voice]], [[grammatical voice|passive voice]], disposal sentence, [[imperative mood]], [[optative mood]], and [[prohibitive mood]].\n\nThere are two [[word order]]s in Amis language, called '''\"General\" Word Order''' and '''\"Special\" Word Order'''.\n\nBelow are some examples of Amis sentence:\n\n===\"General\" Word Order Sentence I : Verb\u2013subject===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Currently the largest of the Formosan languages, it is spoken from [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in the north to [[Taitung City|Taitung]] in the south, with another population near the southern end of the island, though the northern varieties are considered to be separate languages.\n\nGovernment services in counties where many [[Amis people]] live in Taiwan, such as the Hualien and Taitung railway stations, broadcast in Amis alongside Mandarin. However, few Amis under the age of 20 in 1995 spoke the language, and it is not known how many of the 138,000 ethnic Amis are speakers.\n\n==Dialects==\nAmis is a [[dialect cluster]]. There are five dialects, Southern Amis, Tavalong-Vataan, Central Amis, Chengkung-Kwangshan, and Northern Amis (Nanshi Amis, which includes Nataoran).\n\n[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]] is a moribund language spoken among the northernmost ethnic Amis but is mutually unintelligible with the Northern Amis dialect.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following discussion covers the central dialect of Amis (Maddieson & Wright).\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximants]]\n| w || || || j || || ||\n|}\n\nThe voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k \u02a1/}} and the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} are [[Unreleased stop|released]] in clusters, so that ''cecay'' \"one\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u1d4at\u0361saj]}}; as is {{IPA|/s/}}: ''sepat'' \"four\" is {{IPA|[s\u1d4apat\u02b0]}}. The glottal stop is an exception, frequently having no audible release in final position. The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] fricatives, {{IPA|/v \u026e \u0263/}} (the latter found only in loanwords) are devoiced to {{IPA|[f \u026c x]}} in utterance-final and sometimes initial position. {{IPA|/\u026e/}} may be [[interdental]] or post-dental. The sibilants, {{IPA|/t\u0361s s/}}, are optionally palatalized ({{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255 \u0255]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in word-initial position. {{IPA|/\u027a/}} is often post-alveolar, and in final position it is released: {{IPA|[\u02a1u\u02a1u\u027a\u0320\u1d4a]}} \"fog\".\n\n{{IPA|/\u026e/}} shows dramatic dialectical variation. In [[Fengbin, Hualien|Fengbin]], a town in the center of Amis territory, it is pronounced as a [[Central consonant|central]] dental fricative, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}}, whereas in the town of Kangko, only {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away, it is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u032a]}}. In Northern Amis, it is a plosive {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}, which may be laxed to {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}} intervocalically. The epiglottals are also reported to have different pronunciations in the north, but the descriptions are contradictory. In Central Amis, {{IPA|/\u029c/}} is always voiceless and {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} is often accompanied by vibrations that suggest it involves an epiglottal trill {{IPAblink|\u02a2}}. Edmondson and Elsing report that these are true epiglottals initially and medially, but in utterance-final position they are [[epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto\u2013pharyngeal]].\n\nSakizaya, considered to be a separate language, contrasts a voiced {{IPA|/z/}} with voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\nIn the practical orthography, {{IPA|/ts/}} is written {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} {{angle bracket|'}}, {{IPA|/\u0294/}} {{angle bracket|^}}, {{IPA|/\u026e/}} {{angle bracket|d}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} {{angle bracket|ng}}, and {{IPA|/\u029c/}} {{angle bracket|x}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!

Despite the fact that a great deal of latitude is afforded by only needing to distinguish three vowels, Amis vowels stay close to their cardinal values, though there is more movement of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} toward each other (tending to the {{IPA|[o]}} range) than there is in front-vowel space (in the {{IPA|[e]}} range).\n\nA voiceless epenthetic schwa optionally breaks up consonant clusters, as noted above. However, there are a small number of words where a short schwa (written ''e)'' may be phonemic. However, no contrast involving the schwa is known, and if it is also epenthetic, then Amis has words with no phonemic vowels at all. Examples of this ''e'' are ''malmes'' \"sad\", pronounced {{IPA|[ma\u027a\u0259\u0306m\u02d0\u0259\u0306s]}}, and ''\u2019nem'' \"six\", pronounced {{IPA|[\u02a1n\u0259\u0306m]}} or {{IPA|[\u02a1\u0259\u0306n\u0259\u0306m]}}.\n\n== Examples of words ==\n{|width=\"100%\"|\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*lotong: monkey/ape\n*fafoy: pig\n*wacu: dog\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*cecay: one\n*tosa: two\n*tolo: three\n*sepat: four\n*lima: five\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*enem: six\n*pito: seven\n*falo: eight\n*siwa: nine\n*polo': ten\n|-\n|}\n\n* Compare with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] baboy (pig), tatlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anim (6), pito (7), walo (8)\n* Compare with [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] asu (dog), atlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anam (6), pitu/pito (7), walu/walo (8), siyam (9), apulu/apulo (10) and ama (father) and ima (mother)\n* Compare with [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] baboy(pig), aso(dog), maysa(1), dua(2), tallo(3), uppat(4), lima(5), inem(6), pito(7), walo(8), siam(9), sangapulo(10)\n* Compare with Javanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), asu (dog), siji (1), loro (2), telu (3), papat (4), lima (5), enem (6), pitu (7), wolu (8), sanga (9), sepuluh (10)\n* Compare with Sundanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), hiji (1), dua (2), tilu (3), opat (4), lima (5), genep (6), tujuh (7), dalapan (8), salapan (9), sapuluh (10)\n* Compare with [[Malay language|Malay]] lotong (monkey), babi (pig), satu (1), dua (2), telu (3), empat (4), lima (5), enam (6), sembilan (9), sepuluh (10)\n*maolah kako mimali = I like to play sports.\n*takaraw ko pita\u2019kod = I jump very high.\n*kalamkam ko kacomikay = I run very fast.\n*Ira ko tata\u2019angay a mata ako = I have big eyes\n*mamangay a ngoyos\u2019= A small mouth\n*takaya\u2019ay a fokes = long hair\n*sowal san ko kahacecay a tamdaw makapahay kako = Everyone tells me that I am beautiful.\n*mafana\u2019ay miasik, misawsaw to kaysing, milidong to fodoy = I can sweep the floor, wash dishes and clothing.\n*maolah midemak kako to tayal no loma\u2019 = I love to do household chores.\n*nawhani maolah kako to loma\u2019 no mako = Because I love my home.\n\n==Grammar==\nVerbs in the Amis language have some inflections including [[existential clause]], [[active voice]], [[grammatical voice|passive voice]], disposal sentence, [[imperative mood]], [[optative mood]], and [[prohibitive mood]].\n\nThere are two [[word order]]s in Amis language, called '''\"General\" Word Order''' and '''\"Special\" Word Order'''.\n\nBelow are some examples of Amis sentence:\n\n===\"General\" Word Order Sentence I : Verb\u2013subject===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 1901 he sang Borrachio in the premiere of [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (opera)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and soon appeared in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in light opera and [[Edwardian musical comedy]]. He appeared regularly at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] between 1908 and 1924, becoming known for roles in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, among others, both in Britain and America.<ref name=Oxford/> He was also in demand as a concert artist.

His twin brothers, Harry and Charles, were two years older. The family had musical inclinations. Hyde later recalled:\n<blockquote>\nMy earliest recollection of things musical is going to church one Sunday morning with my father, who was principal tenor in the choir. I was presented to an elderly, dignified gentleman, who asked me to sing \"Doh, re, mi.\" With all the assurance that the mature age of six could command, I stammered, `Yes, sir.' There was a touch of comedy behind all this, because the smallest [[surplice]] was much too large for my tiny body. However, it was placed upon me, and I walked up the aisle with the other members of the choir \u2013 holding huge folds of starched linen in my, then, small hands \u2013 I was a choir boy.
