Historically, locksmiths would make the entire lock, working for hours hand cutting screws and doing much file-work.  Lock designs became significantly more complicated in the 18th century, and locksmiths often specialised in repairing or designing locks. After the rise of cheap mass production, the vast majority of locks are repaired by swapping of parts or like-for-like replacement or upgraded to modern mass-production items. Until more recently, safes and strongboxes were the exceptions to this, and to this day large vaults are custom designed and built at great cost, as the cost of this is lower than the very limited scope for mass production would allow, and the risk of a copy being obtained and defeated as practice is removed.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nAlthough fitting of keys to replace lost keys to automobiles and homes and the changing of keys for homes and businesses to maintain security are still an important part of locksmithing, locksmiths today are primarily involved in the installation of higher quality lock-sets and the design, implementation and management of keying and key control systems. Most locksmiths also do [[electronic lock]] servicing, such as making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and the implementation and application of access control systems protecting individuals and assets for many large institutions.<ref name=\"OOH1976\">{{cite book |last1=Statistics |first1=United States Bureau of Labor |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook |date=1976 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Division of Occupational Outlook |pages=416-417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00lIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA416 |accessdate=15 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of physical security, a locksmith's work frequently involves making a determination of the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommending and implementing appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create \"security layers\" which exceed the reasonable gain to an intruder or attacker. The more different security layers are implemented, the more the requirement for additional skills and knowledge and tools to defeat them all. But because each layer comes at an expense to the customer, the application of appropriate levels without exceeding reasonable costs to the customer is often very important and requires a skilled and knowledgeable locksmith to determine.\n\n==Employment==\nLocksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional (employed by an institution) or investigatory (forensic locksmiths) or may specialise in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician.<ref name=\"OOH1976\" /> Many are also security consultants, but not every security consultant has the skills and knowledge of a locksmith. Locksmiths are frequently certified in specific skill areas or to a level of skill within the trade. This is separate from certificates of completion of training courses. In determining skill levels, certifications from manufacturers or locksmith associations are usually more valid criteria than certificates of completion. Some locksmiths decide to call themselves \"Master Locksmiths\" whether they are fully trained or not, and some training certificates appear quite authoritative.\n\nIn the UK, there is no current government regulation for locksmithing, so effectively anyone can trade and operate as a locksmith with no skill or knowledge of the industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/are-locksmiths-licensed/|title=Are locksmiths licensed in the UK?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, licensing for locksmiths was introduced in 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psa.gov.ie/en/PSA/Pages/NS16000015|title=Licensing of Locksmiths}}</ref> with locksmiths having to obtain a PSA license.\n\nThe majority of locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, not just locking mechanisms. This includes door closer's, door hinges, electric strikes, frame repairs and other door hardware.\n\n==Full disclosure==\n\nThe issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing, in a 19th-century controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community, or revealed to the public.\n\nAccording to [[A.

This is a fallacy. Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.\n\nRogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it among themselves, as they have lately done. If a lock, let it have been made in whatever country, or by whatever maker, is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be, surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the dishonest are tolerably certain to apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.\n\nIt cannot be too earnestly urged that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better for all parties.

Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418).

In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''{{nihongo|[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]|\u7d05\u767d\u6b4c\u5408\u6226}}'' (''Red/White Singing Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges, audience members at the [[NHK Hall]], and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-19, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over.

[[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".  At midnight, everyone toasts and greets each other and fireworks are lit.\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with friends and family. At exactly midnight, all radio and television programmes operated by [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast the sound of the [[Pummerin]], the bell of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]], followed by the ''Donauwalzer'' (\"[[The Blue Danube]]\") by [[Johann Strauss II]]. Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

(23741249829).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Prague]] New Year Fireworks]]\nNew Year's Eve (''Silvestr/Silvester'') celebrations and traditions in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are very similar. New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

Some people eat [[ice cream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}</ref>\n\nThe holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.\n\nDinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes [[zampone]] or [[cotechino]] (a meal made with [[pig's trotters]] or entrails), and lentils. At 20:30, the President reads a television message of greetings to Italians.\n\nAt midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the country. Rarely followed today is the tradition that consist in eating [[lentil]] stew when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent coins.\n\n===Malta===\n[[Malta]] organized its first New Year's street party in 2009 in [[Floriana]]. The event was not highly advertised and proved controversial, due to the closing of an arterial street for the day. In 2010 there were the first national celebrations in [[St. George's Square]], [[Valletta]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maltanewyearseve.com |title=Official New Year's Eve Street Celebrations Website in Malta |publisher=Maltanewyearseve.com |accessdate=31 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206100908/http://www.maltanewyearseve.com/ |archivedate=6 December 2010  }}</ref> Although professional fireworks are very popular in Malta, they are almost totally absent on New Year's Eve.

It is usually celebrated with family or friends, at home or outside. Restaurants, clubs, caf\u00e9s and hotels organize celebrations with food and music.\n\n===Netherlands===\nNew Year's Eve (''Oud en Nieuw'' or ''Oudejaarsavond'') in the [[Netherlands]] is usually celebrated as a cozy evening with family or friends, although many people attend big organized parties. Traditional snack foods are ''[[oliebol]]len'' (oil dumplings) and ''appelbeignets'' (apple slice [[fritter]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/netherlands/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in the Netherlands}}</ref> On television, the main feature is the ''[[oudejaarsconference]]'', a performance by one of the major Dutch [[Kleinkunst|cabaretiers]] (comparable to [[stand-up comedy]], but more serious, generally including a satirical review of the year's politics).

In rural areas, the tradition of [[:nl:Carbidschieten]] (''blasting off footballs or churnlids with [[Calcium carbide]] gas filled milk churns'') is performed instead of lighting fireworks.\n\n===North Macedonia===\nNew Year's Eve is celebrated across [[North Macedonia]]. New Year's Day is celebrated by day-long fireworks shows. The day is celebrated together with family or friends at home or in restaurants, clubs, caf\u00e9s and hotels. During the day-time celebration, children get gifts. Evening celebrations include food, music, and dancing to both traditional Macedonian folk music, and modern music. New Year's Eve is celebrated on 31 December and also on 14 January according to the Macedonian Orthodox Calendar.\n\n===Norway===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn [[Norway]] New Year's Eve (''Nytt\u00e5rsaften'') is the second biggest celebration of the year, after [[Christmas Eve]]. While Christmas Eve is a family celebration, New Year's Eve is an opportunity to celebrate with friends.\n\nTraditionally, there is first a feast, commonly consisting of stuffed, roast turkey with potatoes, sprouts, gravy and [[Waldorf salad]]. The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]].<ref name=\"onet\">{{cite web|last=\u015awierczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv \u2013 sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na \u017cywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Krak\u00f3w]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117013012/http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|archivedate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Similar festivities are held in other cities around Poland.\n\nFor those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination. [[Zakopane]], located in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], is the most popular Polish mountain resort in winter.\n\nAlso, New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations are in [[Katowice]], near the [[Spodek]] arena.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]]. New Year's Eve is also marked by a national all-night telecast on [[Romanian Television]], which also celebrates its anniversary on this holiday, having opened its doors in the New Year's Eve of 1956.\n\n===Russia===\n{{main|Novy God}}\n[[File:S novym godom 2012.ogv|thumb|left|Midnight at Red Square in 2012.]]\nThe most prominent public celebration of the New Year is held at [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] under the [[Kremlin Clock]]\u2014whose chimes at midnight are traditionally followed by the playing of the [[Russian national anthem]], and a fireworks display.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/world/russia-unveils-new-national-anthem-joining-old-soviet-tune-older-unsoviet-god.html|title=Russia Unveils New National Anthem Joining the Old Soviet Tune to the Older, Unsoviet God|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=31 December 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=31 December 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The [[President of Russia|President's]] [[New Year Address by President of Russia|New Year's address]] is traditionally televised shortly before midnight in each time zone, reflecting on the previous year and the state of the country; in 1999, unpopular president [[Boris Yeltsin]] used the New Year's address to announce his resignation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/world/yeltsin-resigns-overview-yeltsin-resigns-naming-putin-acting-president-run-march.html|title=YELTSIN RESIGNS: THE OVERVIEW; Yeltsin Resigns, Naming Putin as Acting President To Run in March Election|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1 January 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=15 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2016/12/20/survival-guide-how-to-survive-new-year-russian-style_663723|title=Survival guide: How to survive New Year, Russian-style|last=Zubtsov|first=Vitaly|date=29 December 2016|website=Russia Beyond|language=en-US|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themoscowtimes.com/articles/the-10-best-places-to-spend-new-years-eve-in-moscow-42618|title=The 10 Best Places to Spend New Year's Eve in Moscow|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Secularity|Secular]] celebrations of the New Year in Russia, also known as ''Novy God'', are derived from traditions associated with [[Christmas]]; [[New Year tree]]s (''yolka'') are put up in homes and in public, and [[Ded Moroz]] (''Grandfather Frost'') delivers presents to children for New Year's Day in a similar manner to [[Santa Claus]]. The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne.\n\nThe Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday with musical guests, four bingo games, and surprises.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race.

After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's Eve. (New Year's Eve is a [[Silvester|feast day]] honoring [[Pope Sylvester I]] in the Roman Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United States.){{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMany Christian congregations have New Year's Eve [[watchnight service]]s. Some, especially [[Lutheran]]s and [[Methodist]]s and those in the [[Black church|African American community]], have a tradition known as \"Watch Night\", in which the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the upcoming year.

In [[Caracas]], the bells of the Cathedral of Caracas ring twelve times.<ref name=\":0\" /> During these special programs, is a tradition to broadcast songs about the end of the year. It is a non-working holiday. Popular songs include \"Viejo a\u00f1o\" (\"Old year\"), by [[Gaita Zuliana|Gaita]] group [[Maracaibo 15]], and \"Cinco pa' las 12\" (\"Five minutes before twelve\"), which was versioned by several popular singers including Nestor Zavarce, Nancy Ramos and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez El Puma]]. The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night. On this day, people go to the parties at club or hotels, beaches, at the crowdy roadsides and bridges where firecrackers are blast out in the sky at night. The roadsides and bridges are also lighted up by colourful lights at night. People do a get-together as well as enjoy with their families.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. Beginning in 2008, a 60-second numerical countdown to New Year's, consisting of [[LED]] lights and pyrotechnic display effects, on the facade of [[Two International Finance Centre]] was launched, followed by a fireworks display, alongside an exhibition of the [[A Symphony of Lights|Symphony of Lights]]. For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]]. New Year is also celebrated in other cities and towns around the country like [[Agra]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Cuttack]], [[Vadodara]], etc., There are lots of shows, events, awards and parties organized all over India. Big and small celebrities and personalities perform as well as enjoy in these parties. Many Discos and Pubs organize big singers, DJs or local talent to liven up the night with their music and songs.

More often people like to celebrate New Year Eve with their family. Hotels and resorts are also decked up in anticipation of tourist arrival and intense competition makes them entice the tourists with exciting New Year offers. Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]]. The [[countdown]] was televised live in [[Indonesia]] via [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on [[satellite television|satellite transmission]], and aired on [[RCTI|RCTI HD]]'s [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik]] and was sponsored by [[Charoen Pokphand Foods|Fiesta Black Tea]]. It included various national performances such as the \"Dunia Terbalik All Star\" performance, which reached more than 1.9 million viewers. Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''{{nihongo|[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]|\u7d05\u767d\u6b4c\u5408\u6226}}'' (''Red/White Singing Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges, audience members at the [[NHK Hall]], and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-19, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over. The elite and educated classes participate in night-long activities in urban and cosmopolitan cities like Karachi, Lahore, and the capital of Islamabad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".

Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]].

The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne.\n\nThe Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday with musical guests, four bingo games, and surprises.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

It was released on June 19, 2009, received mixed reviews and grossed $35 million. The film's score was composed and conducted by [[Cliff Eidelman]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nBoris Yelnikoff is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] chess teacher and former [[University of Columbia|Columbia]] professor in quantum mechanics. Divorced, he avoids human contact except for his three friends and students, patronizing everyone he meets for not matching him intellectually. He spends much of the film washing his hands, all the while singing the \"Happy Birthday\" song\u2014an attempt to gauge the proper length of time for the process. \n \nBoris comes home one night to find Melody, a simpleminded 21-year-old, lying on his doorstep. He reluctantly lets her in for a meal and soon she tells him her story. She turns out to be of a distinctly [[Southern United States|Southern]] background, having been born to [[religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] parents in Mississippi and ran away from them. She asks if she can stay the night, which Boris eventually allows, and she stays with him while she looks for a job. Melody develops a crush on Boris despite their age difference and their varying cultures and intelligence.\n\nMelody finds a job as a dog walker while still living with Boris. Out on the job, she meets Perry Singleton and they arrange a date. When she comes back home, she explains to Boris that she ultimately did not like Perry because he loved everything in the world too much. Boris realizes that he loves her and they get married.\n\nAfter a year passes, Melody's mother, Marietta finds Melody, explaining that she and her husband John thought Melody had been kidnapped. She goes on to tell her that John left her and sold their house after John lost money in the stock market. She meets Boris and is disappointed with him, so she tries to persuade Melody to end her marriage. The three go for lunch at a restaurant and meet Boris's friend Leo. As Marietta goes to use the restroom, Randy Lee James inquires about Melody. Marietta slyly decides to recruit him to end Melody's marriage. Later that evening, Leo, who had taken an interest in Marietta, asks her over for dinner. They spend the evening together, and discover that she is a talented photographer. Leo makes plans to contract her professionally.\n\nBoris explains to the audience that over the next few weeks Marietta changed and started experimenting in artistic photography, exotic new habits, and having an [[open relationship]] with Leo and his business partner, Morgenstern. Marietta still hates Boris and continues to arrange for Melody to marry Randy. She takes her to an outdoor craft market and \"accidentally\" runs into Randy, who questions her about her marriage. Melody initially sees past Marietta's attempt and tells him that her marriage is fine. She warns her mother to stop at once, but Marietta keeps trying. Later, shopping for clothes, Melody meets Randy in another planned encounter and he gets her to admit that her relationship with Boris is not entirely satisfying. He invites her to the boat he lives on, and the two end up kissing and beginning an affair.\n\nJohn arrives at Boris and Melody's home full of regret and hopes to get the family back together. They all go to Marietta's photography exhibit opening together, and he sees how his ex-wife has changed since she moved to New York. Distraught, he retreats to a bar, drinking away his misery. While there, he meets a recently divorced gay man, Howard, and admits something that he has known most his adult life: that he is also gay.\n\nMelody tells Boris she is in love with Randy. Boris is devastated and jumps out a window again, but this time lands on Helena, breaking her arm and leg. As he visits her in the hospital, he asks her if there is anything he can do to make it up to her, and Helena says she would like to go to dinner with him.\n\nFinally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, at which everyone is seen in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John with Howard, Melody with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melody and her parents have completely shed their former Southern [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] New York City way of life and values. (John tells that his former membership in the [[National Rifle Association]] had been but a sublimation of his repressed homosexuality.) They are now all the best of friends, and at midnight they kiss. Afterward Boris is revealed to be the only one who is able to communicate with the audience, and explains directly to them that one has to find all the enjoyment he can, to find \"whatever works\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as John\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Marietta\n* [[Larry David]] as Boris\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as Brockman \n* [[Michael McKean]] as Boris' friend\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Melody\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Randy\n* [[John Gallagher Jr.]] as Perry\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Helena\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Jessica\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Howard\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Morgenstern\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]] and Lyle Kanouse portray Boris' two other unnamed friends.\n\n==Release==\nOn February 2, 2009, ''[[Variety magazine|Variety]]'' reported that [[Sony Pictures Classics]] had purchased U.S. distribution rights to ''Whatever Works''.

The scenes, shot by the excellent [[Harris Savides]], [[Gus Van Sant]]\u2019s longtime director of photography, have a static, blocky feel. Their deliberate pacing and the decorous rhythms of the dialogue might charitably be described as classical, given the picture\u2019s occasional evocation of a Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptation from the 1930s. A less generous word might be sloppy, given the near-total absence of the kind of [[Ernst Lubitsch|Lubitschean]] verve of which Mr. Allen, when he\u2019s on his comic game, is capable. To be sure there is a measure of vigor in [[Larry David]]\u2019s performance in the central role of existential kvetcher, a formerly eminent physicist named Boris Yelnikoff. Mr. David does a lot of shouting and some antic gesticulating, and even throws himself out a window. But frantic action is not the same as acting, and there is barely a moment in ''Whatever Works'' in which Mr. David rises even to the level of credible impersonation.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.sonyclassics.com/whateverworks/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1178663}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|whatever_works}}\n* {{metacritic film|whatever-works}}\n* {{mojo title|whateverworks}}\n\n{{Woody Allen}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Cliff Eidelman]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Letty Aronson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Stephen Tenenbaum]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the Woody Allen film|the Miami Vice episode|List of Miami Vice episodes#Season 2: 1985\u20131986}}\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Whatever Works\n| image          = Whatever works.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Woody Allen]]\n| producer       = {{ubl|[[Letty Aronson]]|[[Stephen Tenenbaum]]}}\n| writer         = Woody Allen\n| starring       = <!-- Per billing block -->{{ubl|[[Ed Begley Jr.]]|[[Patricia Clarkson]]|[[Larry David]]|[[Conleth Hill]]|[[Michael McKean]]|[[Evan Rachel Wood]]}}\n| cinematography = [[Harris Savides]]\n| editing        = [[Alisa Lepselter]]\n| studio         = {{ubl|[[Stephen Tenenbaum|Perdido Productions]]|Gravier Productions|[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]]}}\n| distributor    = [[Sony Pictures Classics]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2009|4|22|[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|2009|06|19|United States}}\n| runtime        = 138 minutes <!-- U.S. theatrical release: 91:34 -->\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = $15 million<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Whatever-Works|title=Whatever Works (2009) - Financial Information|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n| gross          = $35.1 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=whateverworks.htm|title=Whatever Works (2009)|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>\n}}\n'''''Whatever Works''''' is a 2009 American [[comedy film]] directed and written by [[Woody Allen]] and starring [[Larry David]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Michael McKean]], and [[Henry Cavill]].

As he visits her in the hospital, he asks her if there is anything he can do to make it up to her, and Helena says she would like to go to dinner with him.\n\nFinally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, at which everyone is seen in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John with Howard, Melody with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melody and her parents have completely shed their former Southern [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] New York City way of life and values. (John tells that his former membership in the [[National Rifle Association]] had been but a sublimation of his repressed homosexuality.) They are now all the best of friends, and at midnight they kiss. Afterward Boris is revealed to be the only one who is able to communicate with the audience, and explains directly to them that one has to find all the enjoyment he can, to find \"whatever works\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as John\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Marietta\n* [[Larry David]] as Boris\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as Brockman \n* [[Michael McKean]] as Boris' friend\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Melody\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Randy\n* [[John Gallagher Jr.]] as Perry\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Helena\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Jessica\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Howard\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Morgenstern\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]] and Lyle Kanouse portray Boris' two other unnamed friends.\n\n==Release==\nOn February 2, 2009, ''[[Variety magazine|Variety]]'' reported that [[Sony Pictures Classics]] had purchased U.S. distribution rights to ''Whatever Works''.

The scenes, shot by the excellent [[Harris Savides]], [[Gus Van Sant]]\u2019s longtime director of photography, have a static, blocky feel. Their deliberate pacing and the decorous rhythms of the dialogue might charitably be described as classical, given the picture\u2019s occasional evocation of a Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptation from the 1930s. A less generous word might be sloppy, given the near-total absence of the kind of [[Ernst Lubitsch|Lubitschean]] verve of which Mr. Allen, when he\u2019s on his comic game, is capable. To be sure there is a measure of vigor in [[Larry David]]\u2019s performance in the central role of existential kvetcher, a formerly eminent physicist named Boris Yelnikoff. Mr. David does a lot of shouting and some antic gesticulating, and even throws himself out a window. But frantic action is not the same as acting, and there is barely a moment in ''Whatever Works'' in which Mr. David rises even to the level of credible impersonation.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.sonyclassics.com/whateverworks/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1178663}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|whatever_works}}\n* {{metacritic film|whatever-works}}\n* {{mojo title|whateverworks}}\n\n{{Woody Allen}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Cliff Eidelman]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Letty Aronson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Stephen Tenenbaum]]\n", "name_user": "Jmg38", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoundtrack", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_Works"}

Her father left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion and, during the [[Great Depression]], the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva's income. Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could pick up only sporadic, short-term teaching positions. The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where Eva found a teaching position, when Viola was six.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\">Stanton, Mary (2004). \"Viola Liuzzo and the Gendered Politics of Martyrdom: From Selma to Sorrow: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo\". ''[[Harvard Women's Law Journal]]''.</ref>\n\nThe family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies and the teachers were too busy to give extra attention to children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo never began and ended the school year in the same place. Having spent much of her childhood and adolescence poor in Tennessee, Viola experienced the segregated nature of the South firsthand. This would have a powerful impact on her activism. It was during her formative years that she realized the injustice of segregation and racism, as she and her family, in similar conditions of great poverty, were still afforded social privilege and amenities denied to African-Americans under the [[Jim Crow laws]].\n\n==Michigan==\nIn 1941, the Gregg family moved to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where her father sought a job assembling bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola's strong-willed nature led her to drop out of high school after one year, and elope at the age of 16. The marriage did not last and she returned to her family. Two years later, the Gregg family moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was starkly segregated by race.  Tensions between whites and blacks there were very high and the early 1940s saw violence and rioting.  Witnessing these horrific ordeals was a major motivator that influenced Viola's future civil rights work.<ref>Stanton, p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1943, she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary, and divorced in 1949.<ref name=\"uu\"/> She later married Anthony Liuzzo, a [[Teamsters]] union business agent.<ref name=\"uu\"/><ref name=\"teamsters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.teamster.org/content/civil-rights-martyr-viola-liuzzo |title=Civil Rights Martyr Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Teamsters]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> They had three children: Tommy, Anthony Jr., and Sally.<ref name=\"uu\"/>  Liuzzo sought to return to school, and attended the Carnegie Institute in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

After initially meeting in a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, the two kept in touch. Evans eventually became Liuzzo's housekeeper while still maintaining a close, friendly relationship in which they shared similar views, including support for the civil rights movement. In the aftermath of Liuzzo's death, Evans would go on to become the permanent caretaker of Liuzzo's five young children.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/>\n\nLiuzzo so passionately believed in the fight for civil rights that she helped organize Detroit protests, attended civil rights conferences, and worked with the NAACP. She had a strong desire to make a difference on as large a scale as she could.\n\n==Local activism==\nIn addition to actively supporting the civil rights movement, Liuzzo was also notable for her protest against Detroit's laws that allowed for students to more easily drop out of school. Her disagreement with that law led her to withdraw her children from school in protest. Because she deliberately home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested, but did not waver. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/>\n\n==Selma==\nIn February 1965, a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers and beat and shot a 26-year-old African-American named [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], who later died. His death spurred the fight for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) scheduled a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but the ban was ignored. Six hundred marchers headed for the arched [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] that crossed the Alabama River. As the protesters reached the crest of the bridge, they saw a terrifying sight on the other side: state troopers armed with clubs, whips, and teargas, and a sheriff's posse on horseback. When told to stop and disperse, the marchers refused. The troopers advanced on the marchers, clubbing and whipping them, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called \"[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]].\"\n\nLiuzzo was horrified by the images of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|aborted march]] on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police, and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the [[Rev. Martin Luther King]] led the marchers back to the church.<ref>{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2013}}</ref> He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html|title=James Joseph Reeb|website=uudb.org|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She then called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] after hearing the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. call for people of all faiths to come and help, saying that the struggle \"was everybody's fight.\"   Leaving her children in the care of family and friends, she contacted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who took her on and tasked her with delivering aid to various locations, welcoming and recruiting volunteers and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals, and train stations, for which she volunteered the use of her car,<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/> a 1963 [[Oldsmobile]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn March 21, 1965, more than 3,000 people began the third march, including blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], and [[Andrew Young]]. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. That Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a \"Night of the Stars\" celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Dick Gregory]]. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march a \"shining moment in American history.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Murder and aftermath==\nAfter the third march concluded on March 25, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old [[African American]], continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car.  As they were driving along Route 80, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers in Selma, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four members of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] pulled up alongside her. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence.<ref name=\"teamsters\"/>\n\nAlthough Moton was covered with blood, the bullets missed him. He lay motionless when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Like Moton and Liuzzo, Riley was shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.\n\nLiuzzo's funeral was held at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church on March 30 in Detroit, with many prominent members of both the civil rights movement and government there to pay their respects. Included in this group were [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[NAACP]] executive director [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Congress on Racial Equality]] national leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]], Michigan lieutenant governor [[William G. Milliken]], Teamsters president [[Jimmy Hoffa]], and [[United Auto Workers]] president [[Walter Reuther]]. She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nLess than two weeks after her death, a [[Cross burning|charred cross]] was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fourth Cross Is Burned On Detroit Lawn |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823323// |newspaper=[[The Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 4, 1964|page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Arrest and legal proceedings==\nThe four Klan members in the car\u2014Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41), and Eugene Thomas (42)\u2014were quickly arrested; within 24 hours, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson made sure to focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving of the murder of Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one of the men in the car, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., was an FBI informant and therefore protected by the FBI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/3/870.full |author=Gary May |title=The Informant: The FBI, The Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2005 |page=431 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===Alabama mistrial and acquittal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\nWilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo's death on April 22.

The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.<ref>Stanton, p 130</ref>\n\nWhile out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, \"Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact.

Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial\u2014the final trial\u2014got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain had been fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a [[VFW]] Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as \"[[Uncle Tom]]s.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn April 27, 1967, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants.

Edgar Hoover]] began a smear campaign to the press, to subordinate FBI agents and to select politicians, claiming the cut marks from the car's shattered window were \"puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party.\"<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/>\n\nWhile attempting to obscure the fact that an [[FBI informant]] was in the car, and to ensure that the FBI was not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the FBI was concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death.  Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe had called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were traveling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.<ref name=\"Stanton, pp 52-55\">Stanton, pp 52\u201355.</ref>\n\nAutopsy testing in 1965 showed no traces of drugs in Liuzzo's system, and that she had not had sex recently at the time of death.

At the time, Liuzzo's choice to immerse herself in such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as radical and controversial.

He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother Eva had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion and, during the [[Great Depression]], the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva's income. Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could pick up only sporadic, short-term teaching positions. The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where Eva found a teaching position, when Viola was six.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\">Stanton, Mary (2004). \"Viola Liuzzo and the Gendered Politics of Martyrdom: From Selma to Sorrow: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo\". ''[[Harvard Women's Law Journal]]''.</ref>\n\nThe family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies and the teachers were too busy to give extra attention to children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo never began and ended the school year in the same place. Having spent much of her childhood and adolescence poor in Tennessee, Viola experienced the segregated nature of the South firsthand. This would have a powerful impact on her activism. It was during her formative years that she realized the injustice of segregation and racism, as she and her family, in similar conditions of great poverty, were still afforded social privilege and amenities denied to African-Americans under the [[Jim Crow laws]].\n\n==Michigan==\nIn 1941 the Gregg family moved to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where her father sought a job assembling bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola's strong-willed nature led her to drop out of high school after one year, and elope at the age of 16. The marriage did not last and she returned to her family. Two years later the Gregg family moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was starkly segregated by race.  Tensions between whites and blacks there were very high and the early 1940s saw violence and rioting.  Witnessing these horrific ordeals was a major motivator that influenced Viola's future civil rights work.<ref>Stanton, p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1943 she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary, and divorced in 1949.<ref name=\"uu\"/> She later married Anthony Liuzzo, a [[Teamsters]] union business agent.<ref name=\"uu\"/><ref name=\"teamsters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.teamster.org/content/civil-rights-martyr-viola-liuzzo |title=Civil Rights Martyr Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Teamsters]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> They had three children: Tommy, Anthony Jr. and Sally.<ref name=\"uu\"/>  Liuzzo sought to return to school, and attended the Carnegie Institute in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

After initially meeting in a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, the two kept in touch. Evans eventually became Liuzzo's housekeeper while still maintaining a close, friendly relationship in which they shared similar views including support for the civil rights movement. In the aftermath of Liuzzo's death, Evans would go on to become the permanent caretaker of Liuzzo's five young children.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/>\n\nLiuzzo so passionately believed in the fight for civil rights that she helped organize Detroit protests, attended civil rights conferences and worked with the NAACP. She had a strong desire to make a difference on as large a scale as she could.\n\n==Local activism==\nIn addition to actively supporting the civil rights movement, Liuzzo was also notable for her protest against Detroit's laws that allowed for students to more easily drop out of school. Her disagreement with that law led her to withdraw her children from school in protest. Because she deliberately home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested, but did not waver. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/>\n\n==Selma==\nIn February 1965 a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers and beat and shot a 26-year-old African-American named [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], who later died. His death spurred on the fight for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) scheduled a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but the ban was ignored. Six hundred marchers headed for the arched [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] that crossed the Alabama River. As the protesters reached the crest of the bridge, they saw a terrifying sight on the other side: state troopers armed with clubs, whips and tear gas and a sheriff's posse on horseback. When told to stop and disperse, the marchers refused. The troopers advanced on the marchers, clubbing and whipping them, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called \"[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]\".\n\nLiuzzo was horrified by the images of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|aborted march]] on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the [[Rev. Martin Luther King]] led the marchers back to the church.<ref>{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2013}}</ref> He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html|title=James Joseph Reeb|website=uudb.org|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She then called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] after hearing the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. call for people of all faiths to come and help, saying that the struggle \"was everybody's fight.\"   Leaving her children in the care of family and friends she contacted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who took her on and tasked her with delivering aid to various locations, welcoming and recruiting volunteers and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals and train stations, for which she volunteered the use of her car,<ref name=\"serialssolutions2004\"/> a 1963 [[Oldsmobile]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn March 21, 1965 more than 3,000 people began the third march, including blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], and [[Andrew Young]]. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. That Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a \"Night of the Stars\" celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Dick Gregory]]. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march, a \"shining moment in American history.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Murder and aftermath==\nAfter the third march concluded on March 25, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old [[African American]], continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car.  As they were driving along Route 80, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers in Selma, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four members of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] pulled up alongside her. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence.<ref name=\"teamsters\"/>\n\nAlthough Moton was covered with blood, the bullets missed him. He lay motionless when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Like Moton and Liuzzo, Riley was shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.\n\nLiuzzo's funeral was held at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church on March 30 in Detroit, with many prominent members of both the civil rights movement and government there to pay their respects. Included in this group were [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]; [[NAACP]] executive director [[Roy Wilkins]]; [[Congress on Racial Equality]] national leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]]; Michigan lieutenant governor [[William G. Milliken]]; Teamsters president [[Jimmy Hoffa]]; and [[United Auto Workers]] president [[Walter Reuther]]. She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nLess than two weeks after her death, a [[Cross burning|charred cross]] was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fourth Cross Is Burned On Detroit Lawn |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823323// |newspaper=[[The Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 4, 1964|page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Arrest and legal proceedings==\nThe four Klan members in the car, Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41) and Eugene Thomas (42) were quickly arrested; within 24 hours, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson made sure to focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving of the murder of Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one of the men in the car, Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., was an FBI informant and therefore protected by the FBI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/3/870.full |author=Gary May |title=The Informant: The FBI, The Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2005 |page=431 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===Alabama mistrial and acquittal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\nWilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo's death on April 22.

The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.<ref>Stanton, p 130</ref>\n\nWhile out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, \"Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact.

Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial \u2013 the final trial \u2013 got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a [[VFW]] Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as \"[[Uncle Tom]]s.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn April 27, 1967, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants.

Edgar Hoover]] began a smear campaign to the press, to subordinate FBI agents and to select politicians, claiming the cut marks from the car's shattered window were \"puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party.\"<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/>\n\nWhile attempting to obscure the fact that an [[FBI informant]] was in the car, and to ensure that the FBI was not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the FBI was concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death.  Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were travelling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.<ref name=\"Stanton, pp 52-55\">Stanton, pp 52\u201355.</ref>\n\nAutopsy testing in 1965 showed no traces of drugs in Liuzzo's system, and that she had not had sex recently at the time of death.   The FBI's role in the smear campaign was uncovered in 1978 when Liuzzo's children obtained case documents from the FBI under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].<ref name=\"Stanton p53 and p189\">Stanton, pp 52\u201355, 189\u2013192.</ref><ref name=\"Blake p201\">Blake, p 201.

At the time, Liuzzo's choice to immerse herself in such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as radical and controversial. However, of all the deaths to occur during the campaign, Liuzzo's was the only one scrutinized in such a way, where other male activists who were killed were recognized as heroes.\n\nRowe was indicted in 1978 and tried for his involvement in the murder.<ref>Ingalls, 1979.</ref> The first trial ended in a [[hung jury]], and the second trial ended in his acquittal.<ref name=RoweVGriffin/>\n\nOn May 27, 1983, Judge [[Charles Wycliffe Joiner]] rejected the claims in the Liuzzo family lawsuit, saying there was \"no evidence the FBI was in any type of joint venture with Rowe or conspiracy against Mrs. Liuzzo. Rowe's presence in the car was the principal reason why the crime was solved so quickly.\" In response to the verdict, Liuzzo family lawyer Dean A. Robb said \"This is a terrible opinion.

The show then spent its last two seasons on [[UPN]] ending on May 25, 1999. [[Alicia Silverstone]] had a development deal with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]-[[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] at this time, and did not reprise her role from the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/08/1086460286068.html |title=Labourer of love |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-12/entertainment/ca-34277_1_alicia-silverstone-movie|title=Carrey !

[[Stacey Dash]] (Dionne), [[Donald Faison]] (Murray), [[Elisa Donovan]] (Amber), [[Wallace Shawn]] (Mr. Hall), and [[Twink Caplan]] (Ms. Geist) all reprised their film roles for the television series. Sean Holland (Sean), who appeared as Lawrence in the film, portrayed the new character Sean Holiday in the TV series. The program aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from [[1996 in television|1996]] to [[1997 in television|1997]] and with a [[network change]] to [[UPN]] from 1997 to [[1999 in television|1999]]. The theme song for the TV series, \"Ordinary Girl,\" was written by [[Charlotte Caffey]] (of [[The Go-Go's]]) and [[Anna Waronker]], and was performed by [[China Forbes]].\n\n===Differences from the movie===\nThere are several notable inconsistencies in both characters and storylines between the ''Clueless'' film and the subsequent television series.\n\nIn addition to [[Rachel Blanchard]] as Cher, two other major roles were recast for the television series. The role of Cher's father Mel, the part [[Dan Hedaya]] originated in the film, was portrayed by [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] and was again recast with [[Doug Sheehan]] by the beginning of the show's second season on the air. By this time, Mel had grown significantly more mellow and humane than the character Hedaya had originated.\n\n[[David Lascher]] took over the role of Josh from [[Paul Rudd]] in the television series, and the idea of having the character serve as a romantic interest for Cher was almost nonexistent in the TV storylines, while it was a major part of the plot of the film version. By the time the show moved to [[UPN]], Josh was written out of the series entirely. Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist shared the same fate, and were also written out of the show by the time it switched networks.\n\n[[Julie Brown]]'s character in the original film was Coach Millie Stoeger, but in the television series her character's name was changed to Millie Diemer. In addition, Sean Holland, who only had a very minor role in the film as Murray's friend Lawrence, was playing a new character named Sean Holiday. Regardless, Holland's character had significantly more exposure on the television series (and was considered one of its stars) than the character of Tai Frasier (who was also recast with Heather Gottlieb when [[Brittany Murphy]] opted not to reprise the role), who only appeared in three episodes of the show, despite being one of the main characters in the film. The character of Christian, played by [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]], was not included in the television series at all. [[Amy Heckerling]], who wrote and directed the film, also wrote and directed several episodes of the show's first season, but did not remain on board with the series subsequently.\n\nAlthough they did not reprise their original roles of Josh, Travis and Tai, actors [[Paul Rudd]], [[Breckin Meyer]] and [[Brittany Murphy]] all made guest appearances in one episode each on the series as new characters; Meyer portrayed Harrison in the episode \"Do We with Bad Haircuts Not Feel?\", Rudd portrayed Sonny in the episode \"I Got You, Babe,\" and Murphy played Jasmine in the episode \"Driving Me Crazy.\"\n\nThe band [[Luscious Jackson]], who performed the dance song \"Here\" for the ''Clueless'' movie [[soundtrack]], also guest starred on the series in the episode \"Sharing Cher\" in order to perform their song \"[[Naked Eye (song)|Naked Eye]].\"\n\nA few of the show's first-season episodes were broadcast out of order. The first episode to be broadcast was \"As If a Girl's Reach Should Exceed Her Grasp\" on September 20, 1996. The actual pilot episode, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me,\" aired later on November 1, 1996.\n\n===Network change===\nAfter the series was canceled by ABC, the reruns of the episodes on their Friday night [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] line-up proved to be ratings winners for ABC. However, it was too late for ABC to get the series back, and they prevented UPN from broadcasting the series until their contract ran out in late September. ''Clueless'' finished #46 in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with 13.3 million viewers. Only ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (a show on which Elisa Donovan and David Lascher would eventually become regulars) had higher ratings for Friday. Reportedly, the star of ''Sabrina'', [[Melissa Joan Hart]], was considered for the part of Cher on the ''Clueless'' TV series.\n\nUPN cancelled the show after the third season ([[1998 in television|1998]]\u20131999), reportedly because of sharply declining viewership. By the final season, the show had retained only 30% of its original 1996 viewing audience.\n\n==Plot==\n''Clueless'' is a teen comedy that follows the adventures of [[Cher Horowitz]], a California girl who attends Bronson Alcott High. Cher and her friends navigate the ups and downs of high school life as they face struggles with relationships, school, and social status. \n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:CluelessCast.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The main characters of ''Clueless'', (from left to right), Amber, Sean, Dionne, Murray, and Cher.]]\n{{main article|List of Clueless characters}}\n\n===Main===\n*[[Rachel Blanchard]] as Cher Horowitz\n*[[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne \"Dee\" Davenport\n*[[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall\n*Sean Holland as Sean Holiday\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Mel Horowitz (season 1) \n*[[Doug Sheehan]] as Mel Horowitz  (seasons 2\u20133)\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Alphonse Hall (season 1)\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Mrs. Geist-Hall (season 1)\n*[[Danny Strong]] as Marshall Gasner\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Diemer\n\n===Special guest stars===\n*[[Melissa Joan Hart]] as [[Sabrina Spellman]]\n*[[Brittany Murphy]] as Jasmine\n*[[David Lascher]] as Josh\n*[[Lamont Bentley]] as Hakeem Campbell\n*[[Shar Jackson]] as Niecy Jackson\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Harrison\n*[[Paul Rudd]] as Sonny \n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Clueless episodes}}\n{{:List of Clueless episodes}}\n\n==Crossovers==\n===''Sabrina the Teenage Witch''===\n{{see also|Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)}}\nDuring the Season 1 episode \"Mr. Wright,\"<ref>[http://www.tv.com//mr.-wright/episode/23745/summary.html?q=clueless&tag=search_results;episode_title;7 Mr. Wright]</ref> [[Melissa Joan Hart]] makes a cameo appearance playing [[Sabrina Spellman]], her character on the ABC sitcom ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (although she is not mentioned by name). At the end of the episode, Cher and Sabrina walk out of a building together, and Cher seems confused that Sabrina has apparently attended Bronson Alcott High School since September of that year. Cher had never seen Sabrina before, despite the fact that Cher knows everyone. Sabrina then says, \"What, Cher, you think I just snapped my fingers and magically appeared? As if!\" Once Cher's back is turned, Sabrina snaps her fingers and disappears, completely baffling Cher.\n\n===''Moesha''===\n{{see also|Moesha}}\nIn a [[Halloween]]-themed episode<ref>[http://www.tv.com/clueless/scream-again-murray-scream-again!-2/episode/25762/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;4 Scream Again Murray, Scream Again!

[[Alicia Silverstone]] had a development deal with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]-[[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] at this time, and did not reprise her role from the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/08/1086460286068.html |title=Labourer of love |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-12/entertainment/ca-34277_1_alicia-silverstone-movie|title=Carrey !

It eventually was picked up by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] as a film, which then led to the television series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/clueless-oral-history-20-anniversary|title=The Definitive Oral History of How Clueless Became an Iconic 90s Classic|last=Chaney|first=Jen|website=HWD|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> [[Rachel Blanchard]] played the role of Cher that was originated by [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the film. [[Stacey Dash]] (Dionne), [[Donald Faison]] (Murray), [[Elisa Donovan]] (Amber), [[Wallace Shawn]] (Mr. Hall), and [[Twink Caplan]] (Ms. Geist) all reprised their film roles for the television series. Sean Holland (Sean), who appeared as Lawrence in the film, portrayed the new character Sean Holiday in the TV series. The program aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from [[1996 in television|1996]] to [[1997 in television|1997]] and with a [[network change]] to [[UPN]] from 1997 to [[1999 in television|1999]]. The theme song for the TV series, \"Ordinary Girl,\" was written by [[Charlotte Caffey]] (of [[The Go-Go's]]) and [[Anna Waronker]], and was performed by [[China Forbes]].\n\n===Differences from the movie===\nThere are several notable inconsistencies in both characters and storylines between the ''Clueless'' film and the subsequent television series.\n\nIn addition to [[Rachel Blanchard]] as Cher, two other major roles were recast for the television series. The role of Cher's father Mel, the part [[Dan Hedaya]] originated in the film, was portrayed by [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] and was again recast with [[Doug Sheehan]] by the beginning of the show's second season on the air. By this time, Mel had grown significantly more mellow and humane than the character Hedaya had originated.\n\n[[David Lascher]] took over the role of Josh from [[Paul Rudd]] in the television series, and the idea of having the character serve as a romantic interest for Cher was almost nonexistent in the TV storylines, while it was a major part of the plot of the film version. By the time the show moved to [[UPN]], Josh was written out of the series entirely. Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist shared the same fate, and were also written out of the show by the time it switched networks.\n\n[[Julie Brown]]'s character in the original film was Coach Millie Stoeger, but in the television series her character's name was changed to Millie Diemer. In addition, Sean Holland, who only had a very minor role in the film as Murray's friend Lawrence, was playing a new character named Sean Holiday. Regardless, Holland's character had significantly more exposure on the television series (and was considered one of its stars) than the character of Tai Frasier (who was also recast with Heather Gottlieb when [[Brittany Murphy]] opted not to reprise the role), who only appeared in three episodes of the show, despite being one of the main characters in the film. The character of Christian, played by [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]], was not included in the television series at all. [[Amy Heckerling]], who wrote and directed the film, also wrote and directed several episodes of the show's first season, but did not remain on board with the series subsequently.\n\nAlthough they did not reprise their original roles of Josh, Travis and Tai, actors [[Paul Rudd]], [[Breckin Meyer]] and [[Brittany Murphy]] all made guest appearances in one episode each on the series as new characters; Meyer portrayed Harrison in the episode \"Do We with Bad Haircuts Not Feel?\", Rudd portrayed Sonny in the episode \"I Got You, Babe,\" and Murphy played Jasmine in the episode \"Driving Me Crazy.\"\n\nThe band [[Luscious Jackson]], who performed the dance song \"Here\" for the ''Clueless'' movie [[soundtrack]], also guest starred on the series in the episode \"Sharing Cher\" in order to perform their song \"[[Naked Eye (song)|Naked Eye]].\"\n\nA few of the show's first-season episodes were broadcast out of order. The first episode to be broadcast was \"As If a Girl's Reach Should Exceed Her Grasp\" on September 20, 1996. The actual pilot episode, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me,\" aired later on November 1, 1996.\n\n===Network change===\nAfter the series was canceled by ABC, the reruns of the episodes on their Friday night [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] line-up proved to be ratings winners for ABC. However, it was too late for ABC to get the series back, and they prevented UPN from broadcasting the series until their contract ran out in late September. ''Clueless'' finished #46 in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with 13.3 million viewers. Only ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (a show on which Elisa Donovan and David Lascher would eventually become regulars) had higher ratings for Friday. Reportedly, the star of ''Sabrina'', [[Melissa Joan Hart]], was considered for the part of Cher on the ''Clueless'' TV series.\n\nUPN cancelled the show after the third season ([[1998 in television|1998]]\u20131999), reportedly because of sharply declining viewership. By the final season, the show had retained only 30% of its original 1996 viewing audience.\n\n==Plot==\n''Clueless'' is a teen comedy that follows the adventures of [[Cher Horowitz]], a California girl who attends Bronson Alcott High. Cher and her friends navigate the ups and downs of high school life as they face struggles with relationships, school, and social status. \n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:CluelessCast.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The main characters of ''Clueless'', (from left to right), Amber, Sean, Dionne, Murray, and Cher.]]\n{{main article|List of Clueless characters}}\n\n===Main===\n*[[Rachel Blanchard]] as Cher Horowitz\n*[[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne \"Dee\" Davenport\n*[[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall\n*Sean Holland as Sean Holiday\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Mel Horowitz (season 1) \n*[[Doug Sheehan]] as Mel Horowitz  (seasons 2\u20133)\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Alphonse Hall (season 1)\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Mrs. Geist-Hall (season 1)\n*[[Danny Strong]] as Marshall Gasner\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Diemer\n\n===Special guest stars===\n*[[Melissa Joan Hart]] as [[Sabrina Spellman]]\n*[[Brittany Murphy]] as Jasmine\n*[[David Lascher]] as Josh\n*[[Lamont Bentley]] as Hakeem Campbell\n*[[Shar Jackson]] as Niecy Jackson\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Harrison\n*[[Paul Rudd]] as Sonny \n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Clueless episodes}}\n{{:List of Clueless episodes}}\n\n==Crossovers==\n===''Sabrina the Teenage Witch''===\n{{see also|Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)}}\nDuring the Season 1 episode \"Mr. Wright,\"<ref>[http://www.tv.com//mr.-wright/episode/23745/summary.html?q=clueless&tag=search_results;episode_title;7 Mr. Wright]</ref> [[Melissa Joan Hart]] makes a cameo appearance playing [[Sabrina Spellman]], her character on the ABC sitcom ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (although she is not mentioned by name). At the end of the episode, Cher and Sabrina walk out of a building together, and Cher seems confused that Sabrina has apparently attended Bronson Alcott High School since September of that year. Cher had never seen Sabrina before, despite the fact that Cher knows everyone. Sabrina then says, \"What, Cher, you think I just snapped my fingers and magically appeared? As if!\" Once Cher's back is turned, Sabrina snaps her fingers and disappears, completely baffling Cher.\n\n===''Moesha''===\n{{see also|Moesha}}\nIn a [[Halloween]]-themed episode<ref>[http://www.tv.com/clueless/scream-again-murray-scream-again!-2/episode/25762/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;4 Scream Again Murray, Scream Again!

''Inuyashiki'' debuted in the January 2014 issue of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' manga magazine, ''[[Evening (magazine)|Evening]]'' and ended in July 2017. Ten compilation volumes have been published.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s late night programming block [[Noitamina]] from October to December 2017. A [[Inuyashiki (film)|live-action film adaptation]] premiered in Japan in April 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nInuyashiki Ichiro is an older, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

His standard method of killing someone is making a [[finger gun]] and saying 'Bang!', which has the same effect as shooting someone with an actual gun. This will work on anyone who witnesses it, even if played on a television screen. He can also imitate a machine gun by shouting \"da-da-da\" while pretending to hold one, which will have the same effect.

When he takes his wife and children to their new modest home, the children are unimpressed. After a visit to the doctor where he is diagnosed with stomach cancer and given 3 months to live, he is unable to tell his self-absorbed family. One evening, while walking his dog in a park on a hill, he breaks down and cries. Suddenly, he and a young man standing nearby are struck by a mysterious explosion, apparently of extraterrestrial origin. His body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He realizes some of his body's powers after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers. The electronics within his body also manage to identify and expose the teenagers. He then realizes that even though his body is now an [[electromechanical]] [[cyborg]], he still thinks and feels like a human.\n| LineColor           = 4B0082\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Hiro Shishigami\n| TranslitTitle       = Shishigami Hiro\n| NativeTitle         = \u7345\u5b50\u795e\u7693\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Hirokazu Yamada\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Student Hiro Shishigami remarks that one of his friends, Naoyuki Andou,&nbsp;has been absent from school and goes to visit him.

Naoyuki is impressed until Hiro causes cars to start crashing in the street and realizes they are not just tricks. Hiro reveals his cyborg body and convinces Naoyuki to return to school, calmly offering to kill the student who beat him up. Naoyuki however is fearful about Hiro's mental state and powers. After leaving, Hiro picks a house at random and casually kills the occupants by shooting an invisible beam while making a [[finger gun]] gesture. He remarks that he feels 'alive'. When the daughter comes home, he threatens to kill her, and Inuyashiki hears her screams of fear. He drives, following the voice he hears in his head, until, while stopped in traffic, hears her die. He finally arrives at the house, finding the bodies, but is confronted by Hiro who shoots him in the head.

He then hears the voices of people trapped in a building on fire, and tries to invoke the flying mechanism he saw Hiro use. Desperately trying he sings the [[Astro Boy]] theme song and takes off but has difficulty controlling the jets. He eventually reaches the scene, rescuing those trapped inside. He remarks that he feels 'so happy'. Hiro finally convinces Naoyuki to return to school, but when the bullies threaten him, Hiro intervenes and forces them to back off. Later that afternoon he kills four of the boys at a distance as Naoyuki watches. Hiro describes his many powers, including control over electronic devices, including [[Gaming the system|milking]] an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. Naoyuki then says he can no longer be friends with someone who kills and steals, and Hiro walks off. That evening Inuyashiki discovers his healing power when he revives a cat that had been run over and thanks God.

Ten compilation volumes have been published.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s late night programming block [[Noitamina]] from October to December 2017. A [[Inuyashiki (film)|live-action film adaptation]] premiered in Japan in April 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nInuyashiki Ichiro is an older, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

His standard method of killing someone is making a [[finger gun]] and saying 'Bang!', which has the same effect as shooting someone with an actual gun. This will work on anyone who witnesses it, even if played on a television screen. He can also imitate a machine gun by shouting \"da-da-da\" while pretending to hold one, which will have the same effect.

At school, Shishigami and Andou are suspected by the other students to be responsible for the deaths of Tetchan and the others. Andou tries to report Shishigami but cannot proceed. After reading about miraculous cures, Andou suspects Shishigami, but dismisses it, thinking there may be others like him with similar powers. In desperation he screams out that he is going to be killed, and Inuyashiki arrives at his door. When Inuyashiki admits who he is, Andou vows to help him stop Shishigami even if it means killing him. Fellow classmate, Shion Watanabe introduces herself to Shishigami but is too embarrassed to continue. That night Andou gets Inuyashiki to test his powers, but he has trouble controlling them.

She refuses to accept that he is not human until he carries her into the sky. Rather than fear for her life, she pleads with him to stay with her and her grandmother. Affected by her genuine kindness and goodwill, Shishigami promises to save the lives of people who are about to die. A woman dying of cancer receives a message on her phone offering help. Shishigami heals her, and then begins healing people on a daily basis, bringing much joy to Shion. Two months later, he and Shion are leading happy lives.

This began to change during the early 21st century, as several [[List of private spaceflight companies|private spaceflight companies]] either continued development, or were established.  From 2000-2004, [[Blue Origin]], [[SpaceX]] and [[Virgin Galactic]] were founded.  In 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first private craft to carry humans into space.  On three separate one-man sub-orbital flights, pilots [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]] reached a maximum altitude above 100 kilometers, thereby crossing the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]], the internationally recognized boundary of outer space.  SpaceShipOne was carried into flight in a [[Parasite aircraft|parasite]] configuration by [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], its [[mother ship]], from which point it flew into space.  SpaceShipOne was designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and manufactured by [[Scaled Composites]], a company he had founded in 1982.  In 2005, Rutan and Virgin Galactic founder [[Richard Branson]] co-founded [[The Spaceship Company]], a separate manufacturing organization meant to supply Virgin Galactic with a fleet of spacecraft.  The results were [[SpaceShipTwo]] and mother ship [[Scaled Composites White Knight Two|White Knight Two]], also designed by Rutan.  The first instances of each craft were dubbed the [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise]] and the [[VMS Eve|VMS ''Eve'']], respectively.  The parasite aspect of both SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo's flight profiles are shared in common with the [[North American X-15]], an earlier [[spaceplane]] which also performed high-altitude and sub-orbital flights.\n\nIn May 2013, retired NASA astronaut and four-time [[Space Shuttle]] veteran Frederick \"CJ\" Sturckow joined Virgin Galactic as a test pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/05/from-shuttle-ss2-sturckow-joins-virgin-galactic/ |title=From Shuttle to SS2 \u2013 Sturckow joins Virgin Galactic |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=7 May 2013 |website=Nasa Space Flight}}</ref>  Sturckow had previously flown on [[STS-88]], [[STS-105]], [[STS-117]] and [[STS-128]] before entering spaceflight's private sector.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, the ''Enterprise'' was destroyed in a [[VSS Enterprise crash|catastrophic breakup]], killing its co-pilot [[Michael Alsbury]] and seriously injuring its lead pilot [[Peter Siebold]].  Following the disaster, the second SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS ''Unity'', was completed in 2016, and began testing.\n\nIn January 2015, Scaled Composites test pilot Mark \"Forger\" Stucky was hired by Virgin Galactic as a test pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/01/23/virgin-galactic-hires-pilot/ |title=Virgin Galactic Hires New Pilot |last=Messier |first=Doug |date=23 January 2015 |website=Parabolic Arc}}</ref>  Stucky had been closely involved with the development of SpaceShipTwo during his tenure with Scaled.

VSS ''Unity'' VP-03 was a success for the organization, following the 2014 [[VSS Enterprise crash|VSS ''Enterprise'' crash]].

This began to change during the early 21st century, as several [[List of private spaceflight companies|private spaceflight companies]] either continued development, or were established.  From 2000-2004, [[Blue Origin]], [[SpaceX]] and [[Virgin Galactic]] were founded.  In 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first private craft to carry humans into space.  On three separate one-man sub-orbital flights, pilots [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]] reached a maximum altitude above 100 kilometers, thereby crossing the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]], the internationally recognized boundary of outer space.  SpaceShipOne was carried into flight in a [[Parasite aircraft|parasite]] configuration by [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], its [[mother ship]], from which point it flew into space.  SpaceShipOne was designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and manufactured by [[Scaled Composites]], a company he had founded in 1982.  In 2005, Rutan and Virgin Galactic founder [[Richard Branson]] co-founded [[The Spaceship Company]], a separate manufacturing organization meant to supply Virgin Galactic with a fleet of spacecraft.  The results were [[SpaceShipTwo]] and mother ship [[Scaled Composites White Knight Two|White Knight Two]], also designed by Rutan.  The first instances of each craft were dubbed the [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise]] and the [[VMS Eve|VMS ''Eve'']], respectively.  The parasite aspect of both SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo's flight profiles are shared in common with the [[North American X-15]], an earlier [[spaceplane]] which also performed high-altitude and sub-orbital flights.\n\nIn May 2013, retired NASA astronaut and four-time [[Space Shuttle]] veteran Frederick \"CJ\" Sturckow joined Virgin Galactic as a test pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/05/from-shuttle-ss2-sturckow-joins-virgin-galactic/ |title=From Shuttle to SS2 \u2013 Sturckow joins Virgin Galactic |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=7 May 2013 |website=Nasa Space Flight}}</ref>  Sturckow had previously flown on [[STS-88]], [[STS-105]], [[STS-117]] and [[STS-128]] before entering spaceflight's private sector.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, the ''Enterprise'' was destroyed in a [[VSS Enterprise crash|catastrophic breakup]], killing its co-pilot [[Michael Alsbury]] and seriously injuring its lead pilot [[Peter Siebold]].  Following the disaster, the second SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS ''Unity'', was completed in 2016, and began testing.\n\nIn January 2015, Scaled Composites test pilot Mark \"Forger\" Stucky was hired by Virgin Galactic as a test pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/01/23/virgin-galactic-hires-pilot/ |title=Virgin Galactic Hires New Pilot |last=Messier |first=Doug |date=23 January 2015 |website=Parabolic Arc}}</ref>  Stucky had been closely involved with the development of SpaceShipTwo during his tenure with Scaled.
