Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the [[Pallava dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Vijayanagar]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], the [[Sambuvaraya|Sambuvaraya chieftains]], the [[Nawabs of the Carnatic]], and the administration of the [[British Raj|British]]. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the [[Carnatic Wars]] between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at [[Ambur]] (1749), [[Arcot]] (1751), and [[Vandavasi]] (1760). \n\n[[Vellore Fort]] is important to Vellore's history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based on stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].\n\n[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable figures like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and  [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780\u201382, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan's son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.

Many dynasties and rulers dominated Vellore throughout its history, including the [[Pallava dynasty]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Vijayanagar]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], the [[Sambuvaraya|Sambuvaraya chieftains]], the [[Nawabs of the Carnatic]], and the administration of the [[British Raj|British]]. In the 18th century, Vellore was involved in the [[Carnatic Wars]] between Britain and France. It was situated close to several decisive battles, including those at [[Ambur]] (1749), [[Arcot]] (1751), and [[Vandavasi]] (1760). \n\n[[Vellore Fort]] is important to Vellore's history. Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based off of stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].\n\n[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable figures like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and  [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780-82, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan\u2019s son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.

Debuting with ''[[Ultra Q]]'' and then ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' in 1966, the Ultra Series is one of the most prominent [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] genre productions from Japan, along with [[Toei Company|Toei]] produced series ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and the ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Heroes]]''. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the ''daikaiju'' (\u5927\u602a\u7363, \"giant monster\") genre, along with [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' series, and [[Daiei Film]]'s ''[[Gamera]]'' series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the ''kyodai h\u012bro'' (\u5de8\u5927\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc, \"giant hero\") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.\n\nThe Ultraman brand generated {{US$|7.4 billion|long=no}} in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987,<ref name=\"4kids\"/> equivalent to more than {{US$|{{Inflation|US|7.4|1987}} billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation.

They had evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]] and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the {{nihongo|Space Garrison|\u5b87\u5b99\u8b66\u5099\u968a|Uch\u016b Keibitai}} to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.\n\nThe Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or \"warning lights\", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.\n\nUltra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. An Ultra being can be revived with a massive energy infusion, as when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try to minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.\n\n==The Ultraman phenomenon==\nThe show ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' (1967, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), ''[[The Return of Ultraman]]'' (1971, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Ace]]'' (1972, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'' (1973, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Leo]]'' (1974, TBS), ''[[Ultraman 80]]'' (1980, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'' (1996, [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]), ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'' (1997, MBS), ''[[Ultraman Gaia]]'' (1998, MBS), and ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' (2001, MBS). After that the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the \"Ultra N Project\", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the \"mascot\" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as in the final episode of ''Ultraman Nexus'') in late 2003, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]'' (2004, [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]]), and ''[[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]'' (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to the old-school series' style in the form of ''[[Ultraman Max]]'' (2005, CBC). In the course of the ''Max'' series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]'', which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: ''[[Ultraman Hikari]]'', formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.\n\nThe franchise has also been in movie theaters, starting with ''[[Ultraman Zearth]]'' and ''Ultraman Zearth 2'', ''[[Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey]]'', released in 2000, as well as ''ULTRAMAN'', a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of ''[[Ultraman Neos]]'' in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The ''Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers'' movie opened in September 2006.\n\nForeign productions include the 1987 [[Hanna-Barbera]] co-production ''[[Ultraman: The Adventure Begins]]'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Ultraman USA''), an animated movie; ''[[Ultraman: Towards the Future]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Great''), an Australian 1991 production and ''[[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Powered''), produced in the [[United States]] in 1993. The Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only ''Ultra Q'', the original ''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', ''Ultraman Great'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' were known to be translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Portuguese  (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' in [[Brazil]]), [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', '' Ultraman Taro'', ''Ultraman Tiga'', ''Ultraman Dyna'', ''Ultraman Gaia'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraman Max'' and ''Ultraman Mebius''). Also of note is the [[American English]] dub of ''Ultraman Tiga'' by [[4Kids Entertainment]] that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.\n\nIn 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and [[Toei Company]] co-produced ''[[Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider]],'' a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's ''[[Kamen Rider]]''. This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.\n\n{{As of|2013}}, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen (the figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities\u2014it has been revealed in ''Nexus'' that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts). In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/pressrelease/130912-guinness/ |title=\"\u6700\u3082\u6d3e\u751f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u756a\u7d44\"\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u300f\u304c\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u306b\u8a8d\u5b9a &#124; \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u5186\u8c37\u30d7\u30ed\u30c0\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 |publisher=Tsuburaya-prod.co.jp |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref> The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987,<ref name=\"4kids\">{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|title=Properties-Ultraman |website=4kidsentertainment.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228095359/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|archivedate=February 28, 2005}}</ref> equivalent to more than {{US$|{{Inflation|US|7.4|1987}} billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation.

A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', and then again in ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'', when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film ''[[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial]]'' when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse.

As of now,{{when|date=November 2015}} there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.\n\nThe following are the series which have been released as such:\n*''Ultra Q''\n*''Ultraman''\n*''Ultra Seven''\n*''Ultraman Jack''\n\nThe \"Digital Ultra\" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Licensing rights dispute===\nUltraman's [[licensing]] rights outside [[Japan]] have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co. Ltd) based in [[Thailand]]. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, ''[[The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army]]'' and ''[[Jumborg Ace & Giant]]''\u2014the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, [[Jumborg Ace]]\u2014in 1974. [[Sompote Sands|Sompote Saengduenchai]], founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976 that Noboru Tsuburaya, the son of the late Eiji Tsuburaya, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan.  \n\nIn spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed [[Hanko (stamp)|hanko]] of the late Noboru Tsuburaya, who had died in 1995, in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as ''[[Ultra Q]]'' being called ''\"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q\"'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' being called ''\"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven\"'', and Tsuburaya Productions being called \"Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises\", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.\n\nIn the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on those edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.\n\nAfter an eight-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (''[[Ultra Q]]'' through ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'') and ''[[Jumborg Ace]]'' outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of those shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.\n\nTsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after ''Ultraman Taro'', including the theatrical feature ''[[Ultraman the Next]]'', throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.\n\nIn 2005 the American company BCI Home Entertainment (BCI/Eclipse), a subsidiary of [[Navarre Corporation]] announced they had acquired the DVD license to ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' from distributor Golden Media Group Inc., a Hollywood-based distributor, who secured the rights from rights from Tokyo-based UM Corp. Inc., acting as the global agent for Chaiyo. A three-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, followed by a second three-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the Japanese [[stereo]] audio, created by Tsuburaya Productions and Pioneer for their Japanese R-2 DVD release in 1999, as well as the [[English language|English]]-dubbed version produced by [[United Artists]] for [[North America]]n syndication. The original Japanese [[monaural]] was not included. \n\nUnfortunately, the English audio for Episodes 5 through 39 were not all complete, as BCI sourced private home off-air audio recordings from an unknown television broadcast, which were cut to provide for more commercial time. Therefore, the episodes in question would switch to Japanese audio from English audio to cover the missing gaps. Due to these gaps, BCI's publicity department assumed the original series was edited by UA-TV when it was originally prepared for US syndication. Only minor seconds of extreme violence were trimmed from three episodes, none of which contained dialogue. Tsuburaya Productions had a complete run of the UA-TV's version, which their Los Angeles Office, UltraCom Inc., retrieved from a US film warehouse in 1993. In 1994, they provided the English audio for the Expressions in Animation VHS release of the first four episodes, which were sourced for the corresponding episodes in the BCI release.\n\nDuring the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series that he called ''Project Ultraman'', un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring their own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, [[Ekin Cheng]] to the project.\n\nOn August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to [[China]]. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened \"The Ultraman Copyright Study Group\" in response to the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|title=Ultraman in Dispute!|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/10/05/ultraman-in-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2006-08-23}}</ref> In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite.

Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman.

Debuting with ''[[Ultra Q]]'' and then ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' in 1966, the Ultra Series is one of the most prominent [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] genre productions from Japan, along with [[Toei Company|Toei]] produced series ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and the ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Heroes]]''. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the ''daikaiju'' (\u5927\u602a\u7363, \"giant monster\") genre, along with [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' series, and [[Daiei Film]]'s ''[[Gamera]]'' series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the ''kyodai h\u012bro'' (\u5de8\u5927\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc, \"giant hero\") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.\n\nThe Ultraman brand generated {{US$|7.4 billion|long=no}} in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987,<ref name=\"4kids\"/> equivalent to more than {{US$|{{Inflation|US|7.4|1987}} billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation.

They had evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]] and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the {{nihongo|Space Garrison|\u5b87\u5b99\u8b66\u5099\u968a|Uch\u016b Keibitai}} to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.\n\nThe Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or \"warning lights\", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.\n\nUltra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. An Ultra being can be revived with a massive energy infusion, as when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try to minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.\n\n==The Ultraman phenomenon==\nThe show ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' (1967, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), ''[[The Return of Ultraman]]'' (1971, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Ace]]'' (1972, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'' (1973, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Leo]]'' (1974, TBS), ''[[Ultraman 80]]'' (1980, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'' (1996, [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]), ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'' (1997, MBS), ''[[Ultraman Gaia]]'' (1998, MBS), and ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' (2001, MBS). After that the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the \"Ultra N Project\", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the \"mascot\" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as in the final episode of ''Ultraman Nexus'') in late 2003, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]'' (2004, [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]]), and ''[[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]'' (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to the old-school series' style in the form of ''[[Ultraman Max]]'' (2005, CBC). In the course of the ''Max'' series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]'', which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: ''[[Ultraman Hikari]]'', formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.\n\nThe franchise has also been in movie theaters, starting with ''[[Ultraman Zearth]]'' and ''Ultraman Zearth 2'', ''[[Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey]]'', released in 2000, as well as ''ULTRAMAN'', a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of ''[[Ultraman Neos]]'' in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The ''Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers'' movie opened in September 2006.\n\nForeign productions include the 1987 [[Hanna-Barbera]] co-production ''[[Ultraman: The Adventure Begins]]'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Ultraman USA''), an animated movie; ''[[Ultraman: Towards the Future]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Great''), an Australian 1991 production and ''[[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Powered''), produced in the [[United States]] in 1993. The Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only ''Ultra Q'', the original ''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', ''Ultraman Great'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' were known to be translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Portuguese  (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' in [[Brazil]]), [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', '' Ultraman Taro'', ''Ultraman Tiga'', ''Ultraman Dyna'', ''Ultraman Gaia'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraman Max'' and ''Ultraman Mebius''). Also of note is the [[American English]] dub of ''Ultraman Tiga'' by [[4Kids Entertainment]] that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.\n\nIn 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and [[Toei Company]] co-produced ''[[Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider]],'' a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's ''[[Kamen Rider]]''. This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.\n\n{{As of|2013}}, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen (the figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities\u2014it has been revealed in ''Nexus'' that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts). In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/pressrelease/130912-guinness/ |title=\"\u6700\u3082\u6d3e\u751f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u756a\u7d44\"\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u300f\u304c\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u306b\u8a8d\u5b9a &#124; \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u5186\u8c37\u30d7\u30ed\u30c0\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 |publisher=Tsuburaya-prod.co.jp |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref> The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987,<ref name=\"4kids\">{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|title=Properties-Ultraman |website=4kidsentertainment.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228095359/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|archivedate=February 28, 2005}}</ref> equivalent to more than {{US$|{{Inflation|US|7.4|1987}} billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation.

A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', and then again in ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'', when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film ''[[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial]]'' when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse.

As of now,{{when|date=November 2015}} there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.\n\nThe following are the series which have been released as such:\n*''Ultra Q''\n*''Ultraman''\n*''Ultra Seven''\n*''Ultraman Jack''\n\nThe \"Digital Ultra\" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Licensing rights dispute===\nUltraman's [[licensing]] rights outside [[Japan]] have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co. Ltd) based in [[Thailand]]. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, ''[[The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army]]'' and ''[[Jumborg Ace & Giant]]''\u2014the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, [[Jumborg Ace]]\u2014in 1974. [[Sompote Sands|Sompote Saengduenchai]], founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976 that Noboru Tsuburaya, the son of the late Eiji Tsuburaya, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan.  \n\nIn spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed [[Hanko (stamp)|hanko]] of the late Noboru Tsuburaya, who had died in 1995, in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as ''[[Ultra Q]]'' being called ''\"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q\"'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' being called ''\"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven\"'', and Tsuburaya Productions being called \"Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises\", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.\n\nIn the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on those edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.\n\nAfter an eight-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (''[[Ultra Q]]'' through ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'') and ''[[Jumborg Ace]]'' outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of those shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.\n\nTsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after ''Ultraman Taro'', including the theatrical feature ''[[Ultraman the Next]]'', throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.\n\nIn 2005 the American company BCI Home Entertainment (BCI/Eclipse), a subsidiary of [[Navarre Corporation]] announced they had acquired the DVD license to ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' from distributor Golden Media Group Inc., a Hollywood-based distributor, who secured the rights from rights from Tokyo-based UM Corp. Inc., acting as the global agent for Chaiyo. A three-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, followed by a second three-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the Japanese [[stereo]] audio, created by Tsuburaya Productions and Pioneer for their Japanese R-2 DVD release in 1999, as well as the [[English language|English]]-dubbed version produced by [[United Artists]] for [[North America]]n syndication. The original Japanese [[monaural]] was not included. \n\nUnfortunately, the English audio for Episodes 5 through 39 were not all complete, as BCI sourced private home off-air audio recordings from an unknown television broadcast, which were cut to provide for more commercial time. Therefore, the episodes in question would switch to Japanese audio from English audio to cover the missing gaps. Due to these gaps, BCI's publicity department assumed the original series was edited by UA-TV when it was originally prepared for US syndication. Only minor seconds of extreme violence were trimmed from three episodes, none of which contained dialogue. Tsuburaya Productions had a complete run of the UA-TV's version, which their Los Angeles Office, UltraCom Inc., retrieved from a US film warehouse in 1993. In 1994, they provided the English audio for the Expressions in Animation VHS release of the first four episodes, which were sourced for the corresponding episodes in the BCI release.\n\nDuring the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series that he called ''Project Ultraman'', un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring their own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, [[Ekin Cheng]] to the project.\n\nOn August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to [[China]]. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened \"The Ultraman Copyright Study Group\" in response to the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|title=Ultraman in Dispute!|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/10/05/ultraman-in-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2006-08-23}}</ref> In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite.

Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman.

One of his projects \u2013 though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed \u2013 was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to diminish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848\u201349 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti, Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and \u2013 with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years \u2013 again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to Berchtold, the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, the Archduke said that \"irredentism in our country&nbsp;... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life\" instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation.<ref>Valiani, Leo, ''The End of Austria-Hungary'', Alfred A.

For example, in 1904 he wrote that \"''The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary''\", and he regarded even [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] as a revolutionary and \"''patented traitor''\".<ref name=\"K\u00f6peczi\">{{cite book |others=B\u00e9la K\u00f6peczi (General Editor); Zolt\u00e1n Szasz (Editor) | title = History of Transylvania | publisher = Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3 | year = 1994 | location = Budapest |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/413.html| doi =  | isbn = 963-05-6703-2}}</ref> He regarded [[Hungarian nationalism]] as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence&nbsp;\u2013 despite the fact that it was the official regimental language.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the [[Military of Hungary|Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g]], as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=147}} and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=133}}\n\nHe also advocated a cautious approach towards [[Serbia]]&nbsp;\u2013 repeatedly locking horns with [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], Vienna's hard-line Chief of the General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to the ruin of both empires.\n\nHe was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a great power, such as during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], in 1900. Other nations, including, in his description, \"dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal\",{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}} had soldiers stationed in China, but Austria-Hungary did not. However, Austria-Hungary did participate in the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to suppress the Boxers, and sent soldiers as part of the \"international relief force\".\n\nFranz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known and supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a [[lying in state]] aboard [[SMS Viribus Unitis|SMS ''Viribus Unitis'']].\n\n==Assassination==\n{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:Minutos previos al atentado en Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|As described by contemporary Spanish magazine ''El Mundo Gr\u00e1fico'': \"The moment when the Austrian archdukes, following the first attempt against their lives, arrived at the City Council (of Sarajevo), where they were received by the mayor and the municipal corporation.\"]]\n{{stack|float=left|\n[[File:FranzFerdinand uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz Ferdinand's blood-stained uniform]]\n}}\n[[File:FranzFerdinandCar.jpg|thumb|The 1910 [[Gr\u00e4f & Stift]] ''Bois de Boulogne'' [[Phaeton body|phaeton]] automobile in which Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated.

However, no one told the drivers that the itinerary had been changed. When the error was discovered, the drivers had to turn around. As the cars backed down the street and onto a side street, the line of cars stalled. At this same time, Princip was sitting at a cafe across the street.

As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The Duchess, seeing this, called: \"For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?\" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nHarrach and Potoriek&nbsp;... thought she had fainted&nbsp;... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening.

Stay alive for our children!\" Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat&nbsp;... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked \"''Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr?''&nbsp;\u2013 Is Your Imperial Highness suffering very badly?\"  \"''Es ist nichts.''&nbsp;\u2013 It is nothing.\" said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nA [[Death rattle|rattle]] began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall).\nDespite several doctors' efforts, the Archduke died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe assassinations, along with the [[arms race]], [[nationalism]], [[imperialism]], [[militarism]], and the alliance system all contributed to the [[origins of World War I]], which began a month after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia.{{sfn|Johnson|1989|p=56}} The assassination of Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War&nbsp;I.<ref>John McCannon.

One of his projects \u2013 though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed \u2013 was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to diminish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848\u201349 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti, Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and \u2013 with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years \u2013 again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to Berchtold, the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, the Archduke said that \"irredentism in our country&nbsp;... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life\" instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation.<ref>Valiani, Leo, ''The End of Austria-Hungary'', Alfred A.

For example, in 1904 he wrote that \"''The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary''\", and he regarded even [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] as a revolutionary and \"''patented traitor''\".<ref name=\"K\u00f6peczi\">{{cite book |others=B\u00e9la K\u00f6peczi (General Editor); Zolt\u00e1n Szasz (Editor) | title = History of Transylvania | publisher = Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3 | year = 1994 | location = Budapest |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/413.html| doi =  | isbn = 963-05-6703-2}}</ref> He regarded [[Hungarian nationalism]] as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence&nbsp;\u2013 despite the fact that it was the official regimental language.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the [[Military of Hungary|Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g]], as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=147}} and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=133}}\n\nHe also advocated a cautious approach towards [[Serbia]]&nbsp;\u2013 repeatedly locking horns with [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], Vienna's hard-line Chief of the General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to the ruin of both empires.\n\nHe was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a great power, such as during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], in 1900. Other nations, including, in his description, \"dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal\",{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}} had soldiers stationed in China, but Austria-Hungary did not. However, Austria-Hungary did participate in the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to suppress the Boxers, and sent soldiers as part of the \"international relief force\".\n\nFranz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known and supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a [[lying in state]] aboard [[SMS Viribus Unitis|SMS ''Viribus Unitis'']].\n\n==Assassination==\n{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:Minutos previos al atentado en Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|As described by contemporary Spanish magazine ''El Mundo Gr\u00e1fico'': \"The moment when the Austrian archdukes, following the first attempt against their lives, arrived at the City Council (of Sarajevo), where they were received by the mayor and the municipal corporation.\"]]\n{{stack|float=left|\n[[File:FranzFerdinand uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz Ferdinand's blood-stained uniform]]\n}}\n[[File:FranzFerdinandCar.jpg|thumb|The 1910 [[Gr\u00e4f & Stift]] ''Bois de Boulogne'' [[Phaeton body|phaeton]] automobile in which Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated.

On arriving at the Governor's residence, Franz angrily shouted, \"So this is how you welcome your guests&nbsp;\u2013 with bombs!\"<ref name=\"beyer146\">Beyer, Rick, ''The Greatest Stories Never Told'', A&E Television Networks / The History Channel, {{ISBN|0-06-001401-6}}. p.&nbsp;146\u2013147</ref>\n\nAfter a short rest at the Governor's residence, the royal couple insisted on seeing all those who had been injured by the bomb at the local hospital. However, no one told the drivers that the itinerary had been changed. When the error was discovered, the drivers had to turn around. As the cars backed down the street and onto a side street, the line of cars stalled. At this same time, Princip was sitting at a cafe across the street. He instantly seized his opportunity and walked across the street and shot the royal couple.<ref name=\"beyer146\"/> He first shot Sophie in the abdomen and then shot Franz Ferdinand in the neck.

As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The Duchess, seeing this, called: \"For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?\" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nHarrach and Potoriek&nbsp;... thought she had fainted&nbsp;... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening. Turning to his wife despite the bullet in his neck, Franz Ferdinand pleaded: \"''Sopherl! Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am Leben f\u00fcr unsere Kinder!''&nbsp;\u2013 Sophie dear! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!\" Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat&nbsp;... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked \"''Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr?''&nbsp;\u2013 Is Your Imperial Highness suffering very badly?\"  \"''Es ist nichts.''&nbsp;\u2013 It is nothing.\" said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nA [[Death rattle|rattle]] began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall).\nDespite several doctors' efforts, the Archduke died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe assassinations, along with the [[arms race]], [[nationalism]], [[imperialism]], [[militarism]], and the alliance system all contributed to the [[origins of World War I]], which began a month after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia.{{sfn|Johnson|1989|p=56}} The assassination of Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War&nbsp;I.<ref>John McCannon.

The city sits on the [[Uji River]], which has its source in [[Lake Biwa]].\n\nAs of October 1, 2015, Uji has an estimated population of 184,726 and is the second largest city in [[Kyoto Prefecture]]. It has an area of 67.54&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, giving it a [[population density]] of 2,735 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/index.htm\n|title=Population Census\n|accessdate = September 6, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Cultural Properties of Uji City (Ky\u014dto Prefecture)}}\n\nIn the 4th century the son of [[Emperor \u014cjin]] established a palace in Uji.\n\nThree [[Battle of Uji (disambiguation)|battles of Uji-gawa]] took place here in 1180, 1184 and 1221.\n\n''[[Sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358\u20131408) promoted cultivation of [[Uji tea]] in the area. Since then Uji has been an important production and distribution center of superior quality green tea. Tsuen tea has been served since 1160 and is still sold in the oldest tea shop in Japan and possibly the world\u2014the [[Tsuen Tea|Tsuen tea shop]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe final chapters of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' are set in Uji, attracting visiting literature buffs.<ref name=\"Green2008\">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Michelle|title=Kyoto Celebrates a 1,000-Year Love Affair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/travel/04footsteps.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=31 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, ''[[shimamono]]'' tea jars destined to be used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]<ref>http://sambali.blogspot.com/2006/09/luzon-jars-glossary.html</ref> were brought by the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' from [[Luzon]] to Uji.\n\n==Geography==\n* [[Uji River]]\n* [[Lake Ogura]]\n\n==Sightseeing and events==\n[[Image:Byodo-in Uji05bs2640.jpg|thumb|left|Phoenix Hall and Garden, [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]]]]\n[[Image:Postbox Uji Japan shaped as tea caddy.jpg|thumb|left|A public post box in Uji shaped as tea caddy]]\n\nMost visitors are attracted to Uji for its centuries-old historic sites, which include many [[Shinto shrine]]s and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]]s. Among the most famous are the [[Ujigami Shrine]] (built in 1060) and the [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]\". The [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]], with its Amida (Phoenix) Hall built in 1053, is featured on the reverse side of the [[10 yen coin]]. It was also featured on several Japanese postage stamps, a. o. of 1950, 1957 and 1959.\n\nOther religious sites include the [[Manpuku-ji]], the head temple of the [[\u014cbaku]] [[Zen]] sect, built in [[China|Chinese]] [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] style in 1661 and the [[Zen]] temple K\u014dsh\u014d-ji, with its Kotozaka entrance (framed with dense thickets of [[sakura|cherry]], [[Kerria (plant)|kerria]], [[azalea]], and [[maple]] trees, each of which dramatically changes color with the seasons) constructed in 1648. Noteworthy is the Mimuroto-ji, which is famous for its purple hydrangeas. The city features numerous other small [[Shinto]] shrines. With a few exceptions, most of the important historical sites are in walking distance of one another and all are easily accessed by rail.\n\nThe last ten chapters of the Japanese classic [[novel]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' take place in Uji, and so there is [[The Tale of Genji Museum]].\n\nUji has many natural attractions, including its scenic riverside, large parks, and a botanical garden. Slightly upriver from Uji bridge, the [[Amagase Dam]] spans the river and day trippers can walk to its base in about an hour. The route, which begins directly across from Keihan Uji Station, is along the river on a paved road and offers access to several grassy open spaces where people can rest and picnic.\n\nThe city hosts two major festivals each year. The Agata Festival, held on June 5, begins in the early morning and runs until late at night. Like many cities in Japan, Uji hosts an hours-long fireworks festival on August 10. Both events draw huge crowds and require that the town's main thoroughfare to be shut down.\n\nThere is [[cormorant fishing]] in summer during the evening, from mid-June to late September.\n\n== Media ==\n* [[Kyoto Animation]], the story of ''[[Sound! Euphonium]]'' also takes place in Uji.\n* FM Uji\n* Rakunan Times\n* Jonan Shimpo\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Rail===\nUji is served by three rail companies: [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]], [[Keihan Electric Railway|Keihan]], and [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]]. The Keihan line which runs primarily between [[Kyoto]] and downtown [[Osaka]] serves the city via the branch [[Keihan Uji Line|Uji Line]] running from Chushojima station and ending along the river at [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]] beside the Uji Bridge. The station is close to Uji's [[Tale of Genji]] Town, Uji Bridge, and the Byodoin. All trains on this line stop at every station.\n\nThe [[Nara Line|JR Nara Line]] runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. [[Uji Station (JR West)|JR Uji station]] was, until a few years ago, fairly rural but was recently rebuilt to better serve the city. Architecturally it mimics the Byodo-in and is on the opposite side of the Uji river, about 10 minutes' walk from Keihan Uji Station. The clock in front of the station is of special interest and, every hour on the hour, opens to reveal an automated show that celebrates the town's heritage as a center of tea production. Like [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]], JR Uji has easy access to the same sites. The station is served by local and express trains.\n\n[[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] serves West Uji with a line between Kyoto and Nara and does not have a station named for the town. The line is primarily used by commuters and includes {{STN|Ogura}}, {{STN|Iseda}}, and {{STN|\u014ckubo|Kyoto}}. No stations are close to the main tourist sites.\n\n===Bus===\nLocal buses have routes in the city and [[public transportation]] is good. Charter buses to and from the [[Kansai]] International ([[Kansai International Airport|KIX]]) and [[Itami]] airports can be caught at most of the train stations.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Keijibypass.jpg|thumb|On ramp for Keiji Bypass]]\n[[File:Uji-jinja, keidai.jpg|thumb|[[Uji Shrine]]]]Uji is south of the main [[Meishin Expressway]] and is served directly by the Keiji Bypass, a [[toll road]] that was completed a few years ago. The Keiji Bypass circumvents [[Kyoto]] and [[\u014ctsu]] which can be subject to traffic jams. The road is notable for its high [[trestle]]s and series of long [[tunnel]]s &mdash; including one that is approximately six miles long. The Keiji Bypass links to Dai Ni Keihan Road (Number Two Kyoto Osaka Road) which is under construction and usable for at least part of its length.\n\nNon-[[toll road]]s include [[Route 1 (Japan)|Route 1]] which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]] and Route 24 which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. These roads are usually filled with traffic and have many stoplights. Close by is Route 307, which runs east/west along the southern edge of the city between [[Osaka]] and [[Shiga]] prefecture.

The city sits on the [[Uji River]], which has its source in [[Lake Biwa]].\n\nAs of October 1, 2015, Uji has an estimated population of 184,726 and is the second largest city in [[Kyoto Prefecture]]. It has an area of 67.54&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, giving it a [[population density]] of 2,735 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/index.htm\n|title=Population Census\n|accessdate = September 6, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Cultural Properties of Uji City (Ky\u014dto Prefecture)}}\n\nIn the 4th century the son of [[Emperor \u014cjin]] established a palace in Uji.\n\nThree [[Battle of Uji (disambiguation)|battles of Uji-gawa]] took place here in 1180, 1184 and 1221.\n\n''[[Sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358\u20131408) promoted cultivation of [[Uji tea]] in the area. Since then Uji has been an important production and distribution center of superior quality green tea. Tsuen tea has been served since 1160 and is still sold in the oldest tea shop in Japan and possibly the world\u2014the [[Tsuen Tea|Tsuen tea shop]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe final chapters of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' are set in Uji, attracting visiting literature buffs.<ref name=\"Green2008\">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Michelle|title=Kyoto Celebrates a 1,000-Year Love Affair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/travel/04footsteps.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=31 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, ''[[shimamono]]'' tea jars destined to be used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]<ref>http://sambali.blogspot.com/2006/09/luzon-jars-glossary.html</ref> were brought by the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' from [[Luzon]] to Uji.\n\n==Geography==\n* [[Uji River]]\n* [[Lake Ogura]]\n\n==Sightseeing and events==\n[[Image:Byodo-in Uji05bs2640.jpg|thumb|left|Phoenix Hall and Garden, [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]]]]\n[[Image:Postbox Uji Japan shaped as tea caddy.jpg|thumb|left|A public post box in Uji shaped as tea caddy]]\n\nMost visitors are attracted to Uji for its centuries-old historic sites, which include many [[Shinto shrine]]s and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]]s. Among the most famous are the [[Ujigami Shrine]] (built in 1060) and the [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]\". The [[By\u014dd\u014d-in]], with its Amida (Phoenix) Hall built in 1053, is featured on the reverse side of the [[10 yen coin]]. It was also featured on several japanese postage stamps, a. o. of 1950, 1957 and 1959.\n\nOther religious sites include the [[Manpuku-ji]], the head temple of the [[\u014cbaku]] [[Zen]] sect, built in [[China|Chinese]] [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] style in 1661 and the [[Zen]] temple K\u014dsh\u014d-ji, with its Kotozaka entrance (framed with dense thickets of [[sakura|cherry]], [[Kerria (plant)|kerria]], [[azalea]], and [[maple]] trees, each of which dramatically changes color with the seasons) constructed in 1648. Noteworthy is the Mimuroto-ji, which is famous for its purple hydrangeas. The city features numerous other small [[Shinto]] shrines. With a few exceptions, most of the important historical sites are in walking distance of one another and all are easily accessed by rail.\n\nThe last ten chapters of the Japanese classic [[novel]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' take place in Uji, and so there is [[The Tale of Genji Museum]].\n\nUji has many natural attractions, including its scenic riverside, large parks, and a botanical garden. Slightly upriver from Uji bridge, the [[Amagase Dam]] spans the river and day trippers can walk to its base in about an hour. The route, which begins directly across from Keihan Uji Station, is along the river on a paved road and offers access to several grassy open spaces where people can rest and picnic.\n\nThe city hosts two major festivals each year. The Agata Festival, held on June 5, begins in the early morning and runs until late at night. Like many cities in Japan, Uji hosts an hours-long fireworks festival on August 10. Both events draw huge crowds and require that the town's main thoroughfare to be shut down.\n\nThere is [[cormorant fishing]] in summer during the evening, from mid-June to late September.\n\n== Media ==\n* [[Kyoto Animation]], the story of ''[[Sound! Euphonium]]'' also takes place in Uji.\n* FM Uji\n* Rakunan Times\n* Jonan Shimpo\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Rail===\nUji is served by three rail companies: [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]], [[Keihan Electric Railway|Keihan]], and [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]]. The Keihan line which runs primarily between [[Kyoto]] and downtown [[Osaka]] serves the city via the branch [[Keihan Uji Line|Uji Line]] running from Chushojima station and ending along the river at [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]] beside the Uji Bridge. The station is close to Uji's [[Tale of Genji]] Town, Uji Bridge, and the Byodoin. All trains on this line stop at every station.\n\nThe [[Nara Line|JR Nara Line]] runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. [[Uji Station (JR West)|JR Uji station]] was, until a few years ago, fairly rural but was recently rebuilt to better serve the city. Architecturally it mimics the Byodo-in and is on the opposite side of the Uji river, about 10 minutes' walk from Keihan Uji Station. The clock in front of the station is of special interest and, every hour on the hour, opens to reveal an automated show that celebrates the town's heritage as a center of tea production. Like [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]], JR Uji has easy access to the same sites. The station is served by local and express trains.\n\n[[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] serves West Uji with a line between Kyoto and Nara and does not have a station named for the town. The line is primarily used by commuters and includes {{STN|Ogura}}, {{STN|Iseda}}, and {{STN|\u014ckubo|Kyoto}}. No stations are close to the main tourist sites.\n\n===Bus===\nLocal buses have routes in the city and [[public transportation]] is good. Charter buses to and from the [[Kansai]] International ([[Kansai International Airport|KIX]]) and [[Itami]] airports can be caught at most of the train stations.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Keijibypass.jpg|thumb|On ramp for Keiji Bypass]]\n[[File:Uji-jinja, keidai.jpg|thumb|[[Uji Shrine]]]]Uji is south of the main [[Meishin Expressway]] and is served directly by the Keiji Bypass, a [[toll road]] that was completed a few years ago. The Keiji Bypass circumvents [[Kyoto]] and [[\u014ctsu]] which can be subject to traffic jams. The road is notable for its high [[trestle]]s and series of long [[tunnel]]s &mdash; including one that is approximately six miles long. The Keiji Bypass links to Dai Ni Keihan Road (Number Two Kyoto Osaka Road) which is under construction and usable for at least part of its length.\n\nNon-[[toll road]]s include [[Route 1 (Japan)|Route 1]] which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]] and Route 24 which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. These roads are usually filled with traffic and have many stoplights. Close by is Route 307, which runs east/west along the southern edge of the city between [[Osaka]] and [[Shiga]] prefecture.  This is a fairly rural road that leads through the mountains and, once away from the urban centers, makes a nice day trip.\n\nOf special interest to [[motorsports]] enthusiasts is the Ujigawa Line (Uji River Line). This twisty road parallels the Uji River between Uji and Otsu and is a favorite for racers. The road is dangerous and often claims lives. Due to numerous accidents, the route is closed to [[motorcycle]]s for most of August, when Japanese schools are typically out of session.\n\n==Friendship cities==\nUji has friendship agreements with three other cities:<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.city.uji.kyoto.jp/data/bozLPVJRBjkCCb4/index.html\n|script-title=ja:\u5b87\u6cbb\u5e02\u53cb\u597d\u90fd\u5e02\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\n|accessdate = August 2, 2007\n|language = Japanese\n}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], Canada\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Xianyang]], [[People's Republic of China]]\n*{{flagicon|Sri Lanka}} [[Nuwara Eliya]], [[Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Uji}}\n* [http://www.city.uji.kyoto.jp/en/ Uji City official website]\n* [http://www.kiis.or.jp/kansaida/uji/index-e.html English guide to sightseeing in Uji]\n* [http://www.taleofgenji.org/uji.html Photos of Uji and its temples]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhRmxS28q9Q English video introduction to Uji]\n\n{{Kyoto}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Kyoto Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Uji, Kyoto| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSightseeing and events:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: japanese \u2192 Japanese", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uji"}

By '''Speedword''' Dutton meant a word in his constructed language.\"</ref> is an [[international auxiliary language]] as well as an abbreviated writing system using the English alphabet for all the languages of the world. It was devised by [[Reginald J. G. Dutton]] (born 8 November 1886 in Nottingham, UK; died 23 June 1970, Skegness, UK) who initially ran a shorthand college promoting Dutton Shorthand (a geometric script), then offered a mail order (correspondence) self-education course in Speedwords while still supporting the Dutton Shorthand. The business was continued by his daughter Elizabeth after his death.\n\n==Requirements for communication==\nAny transcription, note taking or correspondence system must fulfill six requirements (Oliver, 2019, Micro-intellectual capital: A case study of Dutton Speedwords):\n:1. Rules for ensuring an agreed vocabulary, how additions are included, and, how technical terms are expressed \n:2. Systematic method for representing the vocabulary including abbreviations or contractions or truncations, particularly where literal transcription is necessary\n:3. A pronunciation system that makes the vocalisation meaningful\n:4. A meaningful word order\n:5. Rule for designating or rejecting parts of speech\n:6. A method for learning the new system of communication\nIdeally, these requirements should not be wholly biased toward English but consider European, Asian and Middle East languages.\n\nThe system of Speedwords created over 50 years by Dutton addresses all these requirements. Other systems have copied the solutions devised by Dutton without greatly improving his approach. One major advantage of Dutton's Speedwords is that it is readily available to everyone. Its current competitors either require pre-payment for materials before revealing the full details of their system, or, have system that is a subset of the words necessary for a complete system.\n\n==Objectives of Speedwords==\nOver time, three objectives were claimed by Dutton for Speedwords:\n\nInitially, Dutton proposed Speedwords as an International Auxiliary Language (often abbreviated IAL) to encourage people to communicate internationally. Dutton wanted to provide a system so that a sender could use which did not require them to learn the (foreign) language used by the recipient before establishing communication. Speedwords achieves this by relying on a deliberately small vocabulary. For international communication, the writer and reader are different, so, it is important that communication is unambiguous.\n\nThen Dutton promoted Speedwords for high-speed writing. This used ideas and experience based on Dutton Shorthand. Dutton developed this stenographic method between 1919 and 1926. This approach also assumed that the writer and reader were different.\n\nUp to this time, Speedwords avoided synonyms. Synonyms are variants of the same English word and treated them as equivalent. There are two possibilities: (1) One Speedword for different parts of speech. For example, 'hon' refers to sincere, sincerely, sincerity). (2) The same Speedword covers several different English words (e.g., 'kla' means class, kind, or sort. There are also derivatives of Speedwords (e.g., 'bi' means life but there is also 'bie' lively, bik vital, 'bir' creature, 'biu' welfare, 'biv' spirit, 'bix' death, 'bixk' fatal, 'bixy' kill, 'bixya' murder.\n\nLater, realising that some writing required literal transcription, Dutton expanded the vocabulary to allow words which are synonyms that were required to precisely distinguish shades of meaning. Dutton offered two methods to distinguish these synonyms which were required for literal transcription. The first was to use an initial capital letter. The capital letter indicates the Speedword is being used to denote a specific word not the range of words covered by a Speedword. These were officially recognised by being listed in the Speedwords Dictionary. The second method was to underline the Speedword. Dutton does not detail how this would work so it is assumed that this was left to the discretion of the Speedwords user.\n\nFinally, Dutton promoted Speedwords for individual (personal) note writing and note reading. This approach assumed that the writer and reader were mostly the same person. Dutton encouraged this group of users to adopt some personal conventions to adapt it to their personal needs (e.g., underlining). The widely available \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\" (original 1951 edition and revised 1971 edition, but paragraph 4 in both editions) was focused on the note taking and note making objective although Dutton still claimed it could also be used to fulfill the other objectives.\n\nSee {{section link||Design_of_Speedwords}} below for how these objectives were used to construct Speedwords.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThere are three possible uses: writing, speaking including dictation, and, note taking\n\n===Writing ===\nThis was the original use intended by Dutton. Speedwords would allow peoples with different national languages to communicate using Speedwords as the medium. This would be accomplished because it had a compact vocabulary and rigid meanings to avoid ambiguity. All versions of Speedwords were customised for writing and minimising the number of letters that had to be written.\n\n===Speaking including dictation===\nCriticisms in 1935-6 of the predecessor of Speedwords (called International 2 Letter Script which had many combinations of consonants) were focused on the difficulty in pronouncing strings of consonants. Speedwords overcame this deficiency.\n\n===Note taking===\n\"[[Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords]]\" adapted Speedwords to note taking. It modified the standard Speedwords from written correspondence without any time pressure to allow taking notes at high speed.\n\n==Competitors to Speedwords==\nThere are three competitors to Speedwords. They are (1) shorthand as simplified letterforms, (2) shorthand as picture symbols, and, (3) shorthand using non-stenographic systems (that is, alphabetic characters).\n\nSimplified letterforms are also called stenographic [[shorthand]] systems. One type of letterform geometric is based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The most popular example is [[Pitman shorthand]] released 1837, and many lesser-known systems such as [[Boyd's syllabic shorthand]] originally published 1903, as well as predecessor systems such as [[Duployan Shorthand]]. These use symbols which do not represent letters, but rather sounds so the words are written more or less as they are spoken. Contrasted with geometric are script shorthands that are oriented around the movement of the hand when writing. The original is [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] which began in Germany and spread through Europe. Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands are a hybrid of geometric systems and the script systems. The notable example is [[Gregg shorthand]] first published in 1888. Other examples include [[Superwrite]], [[Easyscript]], [[Keyscript]], [[Speedwriting]], Quickscript, [[Breviogrph]], [[Stenoscript]] ABC, and [[Teeline]].\n\nPicture symbols were proposed by Austrian [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897\u20131985) who created [[Blissymbolics]] in 1949 as a universal written language for speakers of any language to learn and communicate. It avoided the problems of constructed quasi-European language like [[Esperanto]], or, natural languages such as English. [[Blissymbolics]] was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language but provided a basic vocabulary that could be spoken.\n\nNon-stenographic systems or alphabetic systems may also supplement the alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, give different meanings when letters are capitalised, or add non-alphabetic symbols. The most popular of these is [[Esperanto]]. Dutton contrasted Speedwords with its major rival [[Esperanto]] by claiming correctly that Speedwords had a smaller vocabulary and did not require the extensive study that was required to converse or write [[Esperanto]]. Another rapid writing system with a similar name, [[Speedwriting]] (also called Brief English Systems) was invented by Emma Dearborn at Simmons College, Columbia University and published in 1925. Her method used letters of the alphabet and some punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English which could be reproduced on the typewriter. Dearborn initially franchised teaching and then sold the rights which passed between various companies who made further changes and marketed it throughout the US and in various languages (e.g., Spanish). Other methods included [[Personal Shorthand]] also known as [[Briefscript]], and [[Keyscript]]. [[Forkner Shorthand]] was promoted as an alternative to [[Pitman Shorthand|Pitman]] shorthand from 1955\u20131995 but is no longer taught.\n\nThe benchmark for pronunciation is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) produced by the [[International Phonetic Association]]. It is easily printable by hand or keyboard although its conventions are often not used to depict pronunciation in dictionaries and other reference materials.\n\nThe major reason that Dutton Speedwords continues to receive attention is its strict alphabetical constraint that allows it to be used on a keyboard, and its breadth of practical application which Dutton embodied in his system.\n\n==Design of Speedwords==\nThe design of Speedwords has four features:\n:1. Unlike other shorthand methods, (e.g., Pitman, Gregg) which use new symbols, strokes or geometric shapes, Speedwords method uses the 26 letters of the English alphabet (upper and lower case) plus the ampersand symbol ('&'). \n:2. Unlike most other shorthand and rapid writing methods, Speedwords has its roots in a shorthand system that Dutton found cumbersome and which he believed he overcome by using alphabetic characters.\n:3. Unlike other shorthand and rapid writing systems, Dutton emphasised the speed of learning.\n:4. Like other shorthand systems, Dutton sought to maximise speed and minimise the amount of writing.\n\n==Principles of Speedwords==\nIn all publications, Dutton describes various principles of Speedwords but there is no consolidated list of principles. They can be summarised as:\n:1. Select its vocabulary from the entire Indo-European language family, particularly maximising the internationality of words, that is, selecting a word that is common between languages, (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 90).\n:2. Abbreviate those words guided by a 1925 analysis by Horn on the frequency of words. The most frequently used words were allocated the shorted abbreviation. So the most frequent words have just one letter (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 5).\n:3. Structure the vocabulary around high frequency words. A 1,000 word vocabulary handles 85% of daily conversation while a 3,000 word vocabulary handles 98% of daily conversation so Speedwords only needs a simple rule for 2% of its vocabulary. Dutton seems to suggest that the solution is to write out the word in full.\n:4. Make one Speedword have only one meaning which results in a basic vocabulary which Dutton calls 'keywords' (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 7).\n:5. Avoid grammatical differences, so a keyword can also refer to noun, verb, adjective, adverb (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 5).\n:6. Create other meanings by adding suffixes to show relationships or create antonyms (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 3).\n\nWhile this approach is sound it has both advantages and a few disadvantages discussed below.\n\nSpeedwords was meant to be written and spoken, so Dutton provided some guidelines on pronunciation which is included below.\n\n==Advantages==\nIn Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, Dutton claims at least eight benefits from Speedwords:\n:1. Knowing just a few Speedwords (he means the one letter Speedwords) allows immediate savings in time and effort (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords 1951, page 7). The words can be substituted for the English equivalents as the Speedwords vocabulary is learnt. This contrasts with geometric shorthand shapes that require the entire system to be mastered.\n:2. It uses the English alphabet. This means it Speedwords can be written or typed (TYDS, page 8).\n:3. It uses a range of Indo-European words. So, its vocabulary has an \"international currency\" (page 87). \n:4. Speedwords are chosen based on the frequency of usage. This means that the most frequently used words are the shortest (TYDS, page 7).\n:5. Correspondence can be exchanged although the individual writers without having to learn the foreign language of all their many correspondents. This means the writers can be ignorant of the language of their correspondent (TYDS, page 8).\n:6. Knowing speed words takes between 20 and 30 hours (TYDS, pages 9, 90). The work of learning \"is a fascinating pastime and in no sense an arduous task\" (TYDS, page 9)\n:7. Speedwords makes 5 out of 6 words far shorter (page 87). This increases the speed of writing and note taking approximately 100-120 words per minute (page 137) or up to 150 wpm (page 8).\n:8. The 'hurdle' to overcome language barriers is considerably reduced because the Speedwords vocabulary is small. The basic vocabulary is 493 words (page 89). The more extensive vocabulary is 1,000 words (page 142)\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe disadvantages appear to be:\n:1. No-one is developing Speedwords, so authoritative information about it is now hard to find, except for the Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book. Some have taken Speedwords and adapted it. For example, see Briefscript by Ray Brown at <ref>http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/index.html</ref> \n:2. The Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book does not have a full discussion of pronunciation which Dutton suggests is essential to using Speedwords. Hearsay is that Dutton had a simplified pronunciation system which may have been shared with some inquirers after his death, but it was never published\n:3. Dutton did not disclose the rules he used to formulate Speedwords so some apparent anomalies and obscurities exist. So, Dutton appears to make arbitrary decisions on the choice of a Speedword. For example, on page 25 Dutton states that 'ao' means 'away' although 'ax' would be logical. However, 'ax' has already been used to mean 'ask'. This shows that over 50 years Dutton had not reached 100% perfection of his system. This is consistent with the effort required to be expended to fully complete as shown by the [[Pareto Principle]]. Also, on TYDS, page 25 Dutton used the Speedword 'dy' for since but gives the rationale French 'depuis' but it does not contain 'y' and in French could also translate to 'for' which has the Speedword 'f'.\n:4. Some guidelines stated in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book are difficult to apply. For example, Dutton allows the reader to use synonyms for the basic Speedwords and distinguishes them from the basic speedwords by capitalising their first letter. Also, for example, English 'at' becomes the Speedword 'A' because Speedword 'a' means 'to' (TYDS, page72). Dutton says the reader can create her or his own supplementary list but does not detail how this is done or how she or he manages it.\n\nNone of these disadvantages prevent its successful use for personal note taking.\n\n==Achievements of Dutton==\nDutton Speedwords continues to be referred to despite its orphan status because of his achievements:\n:1. He preferred to keep the vocabulary compact using frequency of use as the criteria.\n:2. He provided a proven learning approach (incremental learning with repetition) which makes it easy to master.\n:3. He persevered with it over a long period (1933\u20131970) so it was refined with experience and feedback.\n\n==Evolution of speedwords==\nIt appears that Speedwords developed in five main stages:\n:1. As a competitor to Pitman and Gregg shorthand. Based on the available Dutton shorthand publications held in libraries this occurred 1919\u20131925. At this point, it was a geometric shorthand method that competed with Pitman and Gregg shorthand methods and did not use the English alphabet.\n:2. Under the influence of Horn's frequently used words list, an early attempt was made to develop an alternate international abbreviated language. Dutton expressed this in his one-page sheet called International 2-letter correspondence symbols (published 1933).\n:3. Further development occurred to create an alternate international language. It began in 1935 when International 2-letter correspondence symbols were revised and reissued in 1935 as International Symbolic Script. Another version called Word Speedwords was published between 1941\u20131945 (page 18 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). There is a booklet of the same name published in 1946 which appears to contain 100 Speedwords. Despite attempts by Dutton to popularise World Speedwords it was not adopted as an international language. The intention expressed on page 88 in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (1951) to produce language-specific versions of the Speedwords course, did not eventuate. It appears another variation called Dutton Youth Speedwords was published in 1943. Both World Speedwords and Speedwords used words from Flemish (Dutch), French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Scandinavia, Slav, and Spanish are sources for both World Speedwords and Speedwords (According to pages 8, and 88 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951 and 1971).\n:4. By 1946 it had been renamed Speedwords. By 1951 Dutton conceded that Speedwords was ideal for individual note taking and note making (page 7 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords) and made some variations to Word Speedwords to adapt it for the new purpose (page 8 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). His audience is, therefore, students and time-poor people seeking to make the best use of their time or people who incur high costs in communication. He comments that he hopes that \"the student who has worked through the present course will look to this wide horizon (page 88) that is, international communication so Dutton always maintained his duality of objectives and functions.\n:5. It has been revived from time to time in its own right as well as with adaptations. The Dutton Society (no longer extant) promoted Speedwords. Some time management writers and computer specialists who describe online applications including e-mail and situations where communication is either slow or expensive.\n\n==Foreign-language versions of Speedwords==\nIn Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (page 88), Dutton says that \"It is intended to publish this Speedwords course in all the major languages of both hemispheres.\"\n\nThis did not occur. It is unclear whether the impediment was (a) problems that equivalents (including the use of suffixes) were not suitable in foreign languages, (b) authors of the foreign-language versions of Speedwords were not forthcoming, (c) lack of a publisher, or (d) anomalies and difficulties became apparent when Speedwords was translated, making the English- and foreign-language version no longer in uniform.\n\n==Sources describing Dutton Speedwords==\nThere are three main sources of information about Speedwords: (1) Speedwords publications issued by Dutton, (2) the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book in the [[Teach Yourself]] series and (3) third party publications and commentaries (see the references).\n\n===Dutton publications===\n\nAll the Dutton Speedwords booklets published between 1933 and 1951 are out of print. Very few libraries show holdings of copies. Helpful booklets used in preparing this page were the Speedwords dictionary.<ref name=ename3>\"Dutton, Reginald 1945 Dutton Speedwords Dictionary, (Third edition). London: Dutton Publications\"</ref> It consists of 4,000 basic and with derivatives 10,000 English-Speedword and Speedword-English words.\n\nA more accessible version focused on note taking and note making called Dutton Speedwords was published in 1951 in the Teach Yourself series published by English Universities Press as a hardcover. It was reprinted in 1959 and 1962 (with the distinctive yellow dustjacket for both years). A revised edition was published in 1971. It was reissued in 1973 as a paperback. The only revisions made in 1971 were in Part 1 of the high-speed vocabulary appendix (pages 137\u2013147). Part 2 of the High-Speed appendix which is aimed solely at English speakers was unchanged between the original 1951 and revised 1971 editions. Copies of the 1951 and 1971 editions are relatively easy to find second hand. The 1951 edition and its 1962 reprint are printed on higher quality paper than the updated 1971/1973 edition which has yellowed pages that easily tear. Both editions have misprints. This is an incomplete list:\n:1. Paragraph number 83 occurs twice: once in Lesson 8, and, also in the High-Speed Appendix.\n:2. Lists in Speedwords are frequently not in alphabetical order: for example, 'fon' and 'for' in the Alphabetic Speedwords list is out of order (page 94).\n\n===Third party publications===\nThe references below list some third-party publications and commentaries that are still available. Many other webpages have been lost and are no longer available. These missing webpages included the Dutton Society, the Robert Petry pages when he was promoting Speedwords in approximately 1997, and pages by the New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. who promised a new revised edition of Dutton's Speedwords. However, there is no record of a library holding the reissued publication by New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z.\n\n==Timeline of Speedwords==\nDutton was assiduous in developing Speedwords and its predecessor Dutton shorthand. After developing Dutton shorthand, Dutton continued to improve it. But then realising the shortcomings of using shorthand, Dutton develops Dutton Shorthand. Dutton Shorthand was also revised many times. Dutton never gave up refining Speedwords, advocating its merits, and offering it for sale and as a correspondence course.\n\nBelow is a selection of publications that Dutton produced over his lifetime.\n\n===Shorthand publications===\n: 1915 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (First edition).\n: 1916 Dutton Shorthand as a competitor [to [[Pitman Shorthand|Pitman]] and [[Gregg shorthand|Gregg]] shorthand called \"Shorthand in Three Days\" [with Key].\n: 1917 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (Second edition).

Skegness: Dutton's.\n: 1935 reprint (?) of International 2 Letter Script\nThis publication is described by Dutton in an article to the Royal Society. It uses one letter of the English alphabet which was assigned to a class of meaning, apparently directly inspired by Roget's Thesaurus.

These are Speedword stems or elements (TYDS, page 88, 89, 137).\n* 1,000 Speedwords. These are the most frequently used words (TYDS, page 141).\n* 4,000 Speedwords. These are the words in the Speedwords Dictionary (TYDS, page 87).\n* 10,000 Speedwords. These are derivatives of Speedwords (TYDS, page 91).\n\n===Method of learning===\nSpeedwords was taught as a correspondence course by both Dutton and his daughter in the pre and post-war period. Their course was supported by an extensive array of booklets that he had developed. Many of the booklets are listed in the timeline section. The option of enrolling in a course offered directly by Dutton's organisation or third parties is no longer available.\n\nSeveral system such as [[Forkner shorthand]] emphasised replacing some longhand writing with shortcuts as soon as they begin studying the system. Many systems also claimed it was possible to achieve dictation rates above 50 words per minute. These all have learning times of a year or more.\n\nLearning Dutton Speedwords takes around a week to a fortnight. In TYDS (page 9) Dutton cites his records which show that learning the takes between 20 and 24 hours with 30 hours being the maximum. Dutton agrees that individual Speedwords can be substituted one or two at a time. However, Dutton believes that the entire Speedwords system can be learnt quickly and therefore it is not necessary to learn it piecemeal.\n\nSome websites provide summaries of Speedwords (that is, the one and two-letter Speedwords). Some websites provide illustrations or highlights of the method. They are not recommended because they either mis-state Dutton or are incomplete. The chief characteristic of Dutton Speedwords is its detail and the extensive guidelines Dutton provides in his booklets.\n\n===Resources for learning===\n\nA few lucky people may be able to read some of the Speedwords booklets Dutton published between 1940\u20131951. The booklets promote the other booklets which were available but do not explain their interrelationship. So this is a brief description on how to use them. Essentially there are four interrelated booklets. All four are required. They are: (1) The \"textbook\". (2) The \"companion\". It provides additional exercises and the answers to exercises in the textbook. (3) The \"supplement\". It provides further exercises with answers to enhance learning through additional practice (4) The bi-lingual vocabulary. This is an alphabetic list of Speedwords (between 3,00 and 10,000 depending upon the edition) with their English equivalent, as well as an English-to-Speedwords lookup list. The vocabulary contains an introductory commentary by Dutton which is valuable for understanding and using the dictionary. Depending upon when they were published, they may be called \"Dutton Speedwords, \"Dutton Double Speedwords\", \"Duttom Youth Speedwords\" or \"Dutton World Speeedwords\". They were published at different times with different titles and contain minor differences. There is usually more than one edition of each. Later editions (1946 or preferably 1951) are the most complete and up-to-date. They usually contain an explanation of any changes made in the latest edition.\n\nThe most common authoritative source is \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\". It is focused on note taking (page 2, paragraph 4). It contains eight lessons, an appendix and a dictionary with about 1,00 speedwords.\n\n==International versus English/domestic use of Speedwords==\nOne important factor that can affect learning is whether communication is between speakers of Indo-European languages. Learning Speedwords is affected by background. It is oriented to the English language in its vocabulary and sentence construction. Dutton claims (TYDS, page 90) that memorisation will be slower for non-Indo-European language speakers, they will be able to extend their vocabulary as easily once the vocabulary is mastered. This means the learner must always be conscious of whether Dutton is describing Speedwords to be used in international communication or the English only use.\n\nThe English-only use makes concessions that are counterproductive to international communication. Those concessions can be summarised as:\n:1. Using selected synonyms found in English which are designated by the word being given a capital letter. For example, 'O' for 'sir' (TYDS, page 35, para 35).\n:2. Recognising an even wider range of synonyms and additional words that are not distinguished in any way from the internationally usable Speedwords (See, for example, TYDS, pages 148-154).\n:3. Abbreviating some Speedwords (contractions) which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'Bil' for 'bill' when there already is 'bil' used for 'account'.\n:4. Using Speedwords with abbreviations which will be meaningless in international use. For example, omit the 'i' from 'bil' (TYDS, page 141, para 85).\n:5. Creating compounds with additional suffixes. For example, the new suffix '-c' is used to -tion, tious, -cious, -tial, ture, -sure while '-m' is used to express -ment, (TYS, page 152, rule 14).\n:6. Creating compounds of Speedwords which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'ze' + 'nav' is abbreviated 'zev' (page 56, para 60).\nConsequently, the learner of Speedwords needs to be aware that some of the extensions they make and use, may inhibit rather than facilitate international communication.\n\n==Lexicon==\nThe principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see [[information theory]]). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots also called parent words in the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book:\n\n:''a'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} \"at, to\" (< French ''\u00e0'')\n:''b'' {{IPA|[b\u028at]}} \"but, butt\" (< English)\n:''c'' {{IPA|[t\u0283\u0259/t\u0283i]}} \"this\" (< French ''ce'')\n:''d'' {{IPA|[d\u0259/di]}} \"of, from\" (< French ''de'')\n:''e'' {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} \"to be, is, am, are\" (< French ''est'')\n:''f'' {{IPA|[fro\u02d0]}} \"for\" (< English)\n:''g'' {{IPA|[\u0261\u0259/\u0261i]}} \"they, them\"\n:''h'' {{IPA|[hi\u02d0]}} \"has, have\" (< English?)\n:''i'' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} \"in, within\" (< English)\n:''j'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259/\u0292i]}} \"I, me\" (< French ''je'')\n:''k'' {{IPA|[k\u0259/ki]}} \"that\" [conjunction] (< French ''que'')\n:''l'' {{IPA|[l\u0259/li]}} \"the\" (< French ''le'')\n:''m'' {{IPA|[m\u026at]}} \"with\" (< German ''mit'')\n:''n'' {{IPA|[n\u0254t]}} \"no, not\" (< English)\n:''o'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} \"on\" (< English)\n:''p'' {{IPA|[p\u0259/pi]}} \"can, to be able\" (< French ''peut'')\n:''q'' {{IPA|[kw\u0259/kwi]}} \"do (question particle), question, query\" (< English)\n:''r'' {{IPA|[r\u0259/ri]}} \"will, shall\" (< ?)\n:''s'' {{IPA|[s\u0259/si]}} \"he, him\" (< French ''se'')\n::''sh'' {{IPA|[\u0283\u0259/\u0283i]}} \"she, her\" (< English)\n:''t'' {{IPA|[t\u0259/ti]}} \"it\" (< English)\n:''u'' {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} \"a, an, one\" (< Latin ''unus'')\n:''v'' {{IPA|[v\u0259/vi]}} \"you\" (< French ''vous'')\n:''w'' {{IPA|[w\u0259/wi]}} \"we, us\" (< English)\n:''x'' {{IPA|[\u026aks]}} \"whether, if\" \n:''y'' {{IPA|[jo\u02d0]}} \"was, were\" \n:''z'' {{IPA|[zu\u02d0]}} \"as, then\" (< English? \"zen\"?)\n:''&'' {{IPA|[and]}} \"and\" (< English)\n\nSome two- and three-letter words are\n\n:good -- ''gu''\n:know -- ''sa''\n:love -- ''am''\n:beautiful -- ''bel''\n:language -- ''lin''\n:game, play -- ''lud''\n\n(Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots &mdash;''sapio'', ''amo'', ''bellus'', ''lingua'', ''ludus''&mdash;as are \"room\" and \"sleep\" below&mdash;''camera'' and ''dormio''&mdash;while \"good\" and the root for \"air\" below come from [[German language|German]]: ''gut'', ''luft''.)\n\nThe few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix ''-a'' indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, ''bixy'' = kill, ''bixya'' = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ''ky + luf'' (eat + air) to mean \"picnic\". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter  ''r'' indicates future tense and ''y'' indicates past. Thus,  ''j sa'' = I know, ''j ysa'' = I knew, ''j r sa'' = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (''bel'' = \"beautiful\" and \"beautifully\"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ''ca + dor'' (room + sleep) = bedroom.\n\n==Phonology and orthography==\nDutton orthography is irregular.

However, there is morphophonemic contrast in a few cases where a root word contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel.  For example,\n:''pad'' {{IPA|[pa\u02d0d]}} \"paid\" (''pa'' \"pay\" + ''-d'' passive participle) vs ''pad'' {{IPA|[pad]}} \"pad\";\n:''sud\" {{IPA|[su\u02d0d]}} \"improved' ('' \"su\" + ''-d'' passive participle) vs ''sud'' {{IPA|[s\u028ad]}} \"sudden\".<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#Vowels Speedwords pronunciation is complicated: Vowels]</ref>\n\nOnly ''au'' and ''y'' are diphthongs.

A nasal {{IPA|[\u014b]}} occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either.

The letter ''w'' does not occur in final position, but {{IPA|[w]}} arguably ends the diphthong ''au''.\n\nConsonant sequences in word-initial position are ''bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q'' [kw], ''sp, st''.  The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is ''tt'' in ''otto'' \"eight\".  Consonant sequences in word-final position are ''nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk<!--search 'erk'-->, rm, rn, st, sk, and x'' [ks].

It is very unlikely Dutton would have kept ''h'' and ''hi'' as homophones; but we are not told how ''h'' is now to be pronounced.\n\nNote: ''h'' (and its past tense ''hy'' and present participle ''hu'') is used only as an auxiliary verb; \"have/has\" in the sense of \"have/has got\" is ''ha'' {{IPA|[ha\u02d0]}} <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 23 & 25 (\u00a7\u00a750, 51, 52), and page 28 (\u00a770)</ref>\n\nSome suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants.  They are detailed below.\n\n===Affixes===\nAs noted above, the prefixes past-tense ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} and ''u-'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b]}} do not take stress, and ''u-'' is pronounced with an unwritten engma.  ''Me-'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0]}} and ''my-'' {{IPA|[mai\u032f]}} also remain unstressed when forming comparatives and superlatives, e.g. ''mebel'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0'b\u025bl]}} \"more beautiful\", ''mybel'' {{IPA|[mai\u032f'b\u025bl]}} \"most beautiful\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page62, \u00a7308</ref>\n\nSuffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} (English ''y'') when following a vowel.  For example, ''gree'' \"awfully, extremely\" (< ''are + e'') is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8gre\u02d0je\u02d0]}}, ''mua'' \"too (much)\" (< ''mua + a'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8mu\u02d0ja\u02d0]}} and ''dau'' \"allow, grant\" (< ''da + u'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8da\u02d0ju\u02d0]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 368</ref>\n\nThe suffixes ''-n'' and ''-st'' are derived from the speedwords ''un'' \"negative\" and ''its'' \"professional\" and are always pronounced in full and take an epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} when following a vowel, e.g. ''gan'' \"scarcely\" (< ''ga + n'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0j\u028an]}} and ''rist'' \"clerk\" (< ''ri + st'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8ri\u02d0j\u026ast]}}.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375</ref>\n\nThe words ''co'' \"collect, collection\" and ''za'' \"dear, endearment, intimate\" may also be used as suffixes; if appended to a word ending in a vowel, they do not shorten that vowel, e.g. ''lec'' \"correspondence, mail\" is {{IPA|[\u02c8le\u02d0t\u0283o\u02d0]}} and ''perza'' \"dad(dy), papa\" is {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u025brza\u02d0]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375</ref>\n\nSuffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel.  The exceptions are ''-d, -z, -r'', which leave the vowel long.  (As noted above, ''-z'' and ''-r'' take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.)  Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:\n*''-d'' is pronounced {{IPA|[d]}} after vowels and voiced consonants but ''d'', and {{IPA|[\u025bd]}} after ''d'' and voiceless consonants.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 370</ref>\n*''-m'' (derived from the word ''om'' \"article, object, thing\") shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0254m]}} after any consonant, e.g. ''dam'' \"donation, gift, present\" (< ''da + m'') is {{IPA|[dam]}} and ''tegm'' \"cover, lid\" (< ''teg + m'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8teg\u0254m]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 373</ref>\n*Other single-consonant suffixes - ''-b'' (< ''ib'' \"possible\"), ''-g'' (< ''ig'' \"general\"), ''-k'' (< ''ik'' \"property, quality\", ''-l'' (< ''il'' \"particular (e)special\", ''-p'' (< ''ep'' \"location, place, position, set, put\"), ''-s'' (< ''is'' \"complement\") and ''-t'' (< ''et'' \"little, small\") - shorten the preceding vowel and, when they \"can be articulated without difficulty\" are pronounced as a single consonant after another consonant, otherwise they are pronounced in full as the words from they are derived after other consonants.  Dutton adds that ''-s'' must always be pronounced {{IPA|[\u026as]}} after word ending in ''-k'' or ''-g'' \"to avoid confusion with the suffix ''-x''.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 374</ref>\n\nIn addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#SCS Speedwords Single consonant suffixes]</ref>\n*''-f'' after vowels and ''-y'' after consonants\n*''-v'' after vowels and ''-i'' after consonants \n*''-x'' after vowels and ''-o'' after consonants\n''f'' ~ ''-y'' are obviously abstracted from ''fy'' \"cause, make, reason, render\"; the pairs ''-v'' ~ ''-i'' and ''-x'' ~ ''-o'' appear to be arbitrary creations.\n\nAlso in the pre-1951 version of Speedwords, Dutton gave the apostrophe as a possessive suffix pronounced {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}}, e.g. ''l mant'kap'' {{IPA|[l\u0259'mantzai\u032fkap]}} \"the boy's head\".  But in the 1951 Dictionary Dutton list a new root word ''zy'' {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}} \"disease\".  It is inconceivable that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe homophonous with ''zy'' \"disease.\" The apostrophe is retained in \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\" (1951, 1971) but there is no indication how this is to be pronounced.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 3, The Possessive Case</ref>\n\n===Irregularities to avoid homophones===\nThe only examples specifically given by Dutton are:\n# \"away\" as an opposite of directional a \"to\" is ao [a\u02d0'jo\u02d0] as *ax would be homophonous with ax \"ask.\" <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 23, \u00a749</ref>\n# The agent suffix ''-r'' (< ''er'' \"person\") is written as the full word and pronounced with an epenthetic  {{IPA|[j]}}, when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word.  For example, \"maker\" is ''maer'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u02d0j\u025br]}} to avoid confusion with ''mar'' {{IPA|[mar]}} \"marry, marriage\" (In \"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book\", Dutton also gives ''jeer'' \"judge\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0292u\u02d0j\u025br]}} to avoid confusion with ''jur'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u028ar]}} \"law, legal\"; in the 1951 Dictionary, however, \"judge\" is given as ''just'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0292u\u02d0j\u026ast]}}\n\nFollowing 2 above, we may reasonably assume that if adding ''-b, -c, -g, -k, -l, -m, -n, -p, -s'' or ''-t'', then the full word from which these are derived would have been written and pronounced with an epenthetic  {{IPA|[j]}}, thus *''noib'' \"noticeable\" {{IPA|[\u02c8no\u02d0j\u026ab]}} to avoid confusion with ''nob'' \"celebrated, honour, note, repute\" {{IPA|[n\u0254b]}}.\n\nFollowing 1 above, we may reasonably assume that this would always be the case if by adding ''-x'' a homophone would have been created.  We may also assume that the same would apply to the ''-v'' ~ ''-i'' pair, i.e. if by adding ''-v'' we had a homophone, we must add ''-i'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ji\u02d0}} instead; the same well have applied to the ''-f'' ~ ''y'' pair, i.e. if by adding ''-f'' we had a homophone, we must add ''-y'' {IPA|[\u02c8jai\u032f}} instead; but as these suffixes derive from the word ''fy'', it may be that Dutton, following 1 above, would have added ''-fy''.<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#SCS Speedwords Single consonant suffixes]</ref>\n\n===Compound words===\nWhen two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[\u014b]}} is placed after the first root.  When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[\u0283]}} is placed after the first root.  Either affix takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[\u026a]}} after a consonant.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 3, Idea Compounds 377 & 378</ref>   Examples:\n\n:''albe'' \"already\" (< ''al + be'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8al\u026a\u014bbe\u02d0]}}\n:''diel'' \"telephone\" (< ''di + el'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8di\u02d0\u014b\u025bl]}}\n:''rysan'' \"hospital\" (< ''ry + san'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8rai\u032f\u014bsan]}}\n:''opmekav'' \"anti-aircraft\" (< ''op + mek + av'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0254p\u026a\u0283m\u025bkav]}} 'OPP-ish-mek-avv'\n:''ryefki'' \"gymnasium\" (< ''ry + ef + ki'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8rai\u032f\u0283\u025bfki\u02d0]}}\n\n==Morphology and syntax==\nRoot words may function as adjectives, nouns, verb or adverbs.  In \"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\" (1951, London, Dutton Publications) we read:\n\"The English language, like most other natural languages, is inconsistent in having separate words for the adjective 'hot' and the noun 'heat' whereas the same word 'cold' can function as either a noun or an adjective according to its context.  What applies to 'cold' can logically apply also to 'hot'; consequently the Speedword ''he'' denotes either 'heat' or 'hot', according to circumstance. ...\n\n\"Just as there is no distinction in English between the noun 'cold' and the adjective 'cold', so there is none between the adjective 'fast' and the adverb 'fast' (there being no English word 'fastly' corresponding to 'slowly').  What applies to the adjective 'fast' can logically apply also to other qualifiers, and consequently, there is no necessity to differentiate between, say, 'beautiful' and 'beautifully'. This means that, in international correspondence, the Speedword ''bel'' can convey not only 'beauty' and 'beautiful' ... but 'beautifully' as well ...\n\n\"Verbs and nouns are similarly interchangeable, for in the same way that each of the English words 'work', 'answer' and 'praise' can function either as a verb or noun according to its environment, so can any other word have a dual role.  In English the noun form of the verb 'fail' is 'failure', and of 'pay' 'payment'; but in everyday expressions such as 'without fail' and 'in his pay' the unnecessary distinction has been eliminated ... the Soeedword policy is to cut the Gordian knot and make ''pa'' mean either 'pay' or 'payment', ''pre'' either 'prepare' or 'preparation', ''kok'' 'cook' or 'cookery', ''men'' 'remember' to 'memory', and so on throughout.\" <ref>\"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\", pages 5 & 6</ref>\n\nThere are, however, grammatical affixes pertinent to particular parts of speech.\n\n===Verb affixes===\nThe present tense is unmarked, e.g. ''j spe'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259 'spe\u02d0]}} \"I speak\".\nThe past is marked by the unstressed prefix ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}}, e.g. ''j yspe'' {{IPA|[\u0292i ai\u032f'spe\u02d0]}} \"I spoke\".\n\nTwo verbs are irregular:<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 34, \u00a7\u00a7110, 111, 112</ref>\n*to be: ''e'' {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} \"be, am. is, are\"; ''y'' {{IPA|[jo\u02d0]}} \"was, were\".\n*to have ('''perfect auxiliary'''): ''h'' (post-1951 pronunciation unknown) \"has, have\"; ''hy'' {{IPA|[hai\u032f]}} \"had\".\n\nThe unmarked form also serves as the infinitive,  e.g.''sh am spe'' {{IPA|[\u0283i'am 'spe\u02d0]}} \"she loves to speak\" <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 13, \u00a72</ref>\n\nThere are two participles:\n: Present participle has prefix ''u-'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b]}}, e.g. ''uspe'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b'spe\u02d0]}} \"speaking\"\n: Perfect participle has suffix ''-d'' {{IPA|[d, \u025bd]}}, e.g. ''sped'' {{IPA|[spe\u02d0d]}} \"spoken\"\n\nOnly one irregular verb: the present participle of the auxiliary ''h'' is ''hu''  {{IPA|[h\u028a\u014b]}}<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 53 \u00a7241</ref>\n\nNote: Dutton is quite clear that the prefix ''u'' forms a '''participle''', i.e. a verbal adjective, e.g. ''u uspe tem'' {{IPA|[u\u02d0 \u028a\u014b'spe\u02d0 tem]}} 'a speaking clock', ''l ura on'' {{IPA|[li \u028a\u014b'ra\u02d0 '\u0254n]}} \"the working man.\"   Indeed, he devotes five paragraphs to hammer this point home.<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 53, \u00a7\u00a7237-241.</ref>\n\nDutton devotes six paragraphs<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 59 7 60, \u00a7\u00a7292-297</ref> to hammer home the difference between the English gerund (verbal noun) and the present participle.  He is adamant that forms prefixed with ''u-'' may be used ''only'' as a present participle.  In Speedwords the ''gerund must be expressed by the same form as the infinitive'', i.e. the unmarked verb, e.g. ''g amt spe'' {{IPA|[\u0261i 'amt spe\u02d0d}} \"they like speaking\", ''gi ko & go''  {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0 'ko\u02d0 and 'go\u02d0]}} \"their coming and going\"\n\nFurthermore\n:the continuous tenses are formed with \"to be\" and the unmarked verb, e.g. ''s e ri'' {{IPA|[si 'e\u02d0 'ri\u02d0]}} \"he is writing\"; ''w y ri'' {{IPA|[w\u0259 'jo\u02d0 'ri\u02d0]}} \"we were writing\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 47 & 48, \u00a7\u00a7198-200</ref>\n:the perfect tenses are form with the auxiliary ''h'' and the unmarked verb, e.g. ''s h ri'' \"he has written''; ''g hy spe'' \"they had spoken\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 23, \u00a750</ref>\n\n===Noun affixes===\nThe plural, ''where necessary'', is shown by the suffix ''-z'', e.g. ''femz'' {{IPA|['f\u025bm\u0259z]}} \"women\".  Dutton is emphatic that if it is clear from context that the noun must be plural, the ending ''-z'' is not used, e.g. ''ud fem'' {{IPA|[\u028ad 'f\u025bm]}} \"many women\"; ''cz on'' {{IPA|[t\u0283\u0259z '\u0254n]}} <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\"\", page 55 & 56, \u00a7\u00a7250-260</ref>\n\nIn the pre-1951 version pf Speedwords, the possessive of nouns is {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}}, and written with an apostrophe, e.g. ''l fem' ryg'' {{IPA|l\u0259 'f\u025bmzai\u032f 'rai\u032f\u0261]}} \"the woman's house\"; but in 1951, Dutton introduced a new root word ''zy'' {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}} meaning \"disease\".  It is very unlikely that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe with the same sound.

But it is clear from Dutton's entry that the affixes ''-i'' and ''-v'' are '''not''' derived from this preposition but rather that the preposition is a backformation from the affixes.\n\nDutton says [words in italics were written as italicized speedwords in the original]: \"''The'' prepositions 'at', 'on', 'by', 'under', etc. ''are sometimes'' used to convey ''a somewhat'' loose ''idea of'' association ''without any'' definite ''idea of position, as in'' 'at the most', 'by the way', 'on business', 'under difficulties', etc.  ''When, therefore, any'' preposition ''is not'' literally applicable, ''the'' Speedword '' 'iv' is'' used.

These were discussed.<ref name=ename6>\"Oliver, Gary R, 2019 Micro-intellectual capital: The case of Dutton Speedwords, International Conference on Intellectual Capital and Knowledge Management, Macquarie University 5 December.\"</ref>\n\nA major ambiguity is terminological. Dutton uses three terms interchangeably in TYDS. They are 'parent word' (page 9, 88), 'radical' (page 88) 'word-root' (page 51, 52), and 'word family' (page 89). He sometimes uses them identically, to mean the stem, that is an indivisible element TYS page 88). At other times he means the indivisible element plus prefix or suffix or the compounds of indivisible elements (TYDS, page 158). By doing so he lacks the ability to distinguish between them. It would be much simpler to reserve the three terms for the indivisible element and then use the term \"extension\" for the addition of prefix or suffix. \"Compound\" would retain its existing usage. Even more confusingly he adds another term 'word familities' (TYDS, page 89). It is not clear whether this refers to the ndivisible element plus all its prefixes and suffixes. Dutton also refers to \"keywords\" meaning the basic or essential stem words to which prefixes and suffixes are added. So, this means there is ambiguity for the learner on what is the basic vocabulary of Speedwords. Some further research is underway to see if this can be clarified.\n\nThere is an obvious omission and deficiency. These could have easily been rectified by Dutton using his personal knowledge and included in an expanded TYDS edition.\n\nThe major omission is a description of his rationale behind formulating the Speedwords he has chosen. In his opening chapter of all editions of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords titled \"Dutton Speedwords Analysed\" (TYDS, pages 7\u20139) he describes some of the principles he used. For example, using Horn's analysis of frequently used words<ref name=ename7>\"Horn, Ernest 1926 A basic writing vocabulary: 10,000 words most commonly used in writing. Iowa City, IO: College of Education, University of Iowa.\"</ref> to determine how much to abbreviate or truncate his Speedword vocabulary, and, drawing on words common to several European languages. But this does not equate to a systematic account of how new technical words and expressions could be added to the Speedword vocabulary. Nor does it show that the existing Speedwords were wisely chosen.\n\nThe major deficiencies arise from overcoming confusion caused by apparent inconsistencies in understanding what is meant by particular Speedwords given the variety of Speedword formation methods available. There are four possible areas of confusion. First, deciphering the meaning of a Speedword can produce several possible candidate meanings. There are 20 suffixes (TYDS, page 90). The practice of incorporating  a Speedword suffix into the Speedword meakes it difficult to decide whether a Speedword is either a Speedword stem (that is, an indivisible element) or a Speedword and a suffix. For example, the Speedword 'de' is day, 'deb' is debt but 'debe' is yesterday. The suffix 'e' is an augmentive (TYDS, page 37) signalling a comparative increase. So, an untutored interpretation would suggest that 'debe' is a large debt. Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Second, contractions of frequently used Speedwords actually multiply the vocabulary by creating new Speedwords. For example, 'debe' yesterday is shortened to 'db', and 'jecen' percent is shortened to 'jc'. Again, Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Third, there are some puzzling inconsistencies. For example, 'La' is great, 'Mla' is greater. 'M' is also used as an abbreviation for 'Mr'. It is unclear whether this is a misprint with the L in lower case and what the 'm' signifies. Finally, Dutton encourages joining Speedwords together as compounds except where they are equivalent to an existing Speedword. This creates new Speedwords which become unrecognisable because they are not in the dictionary, Again, utton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. The disadvantage is it increases the vocabulary reducing the benefit from keeping the vocabulary small.\n\nIn summary, these shortcomings are resolvable. Ambiguity could be resolved by obtaining a copy of the Speedwords publication which lists the 493 elementary Speedwords but this is unobtainable. It may also contain the rationale for formulating Speedwords. The deficiencies should be addressed differently. Instead of immediately changing some Speedwords, the system of affixes (prefix, suffix) need to be re-examined. The number of prefixes should be reduced. Some overlap (e.g., augmentation, and favourable, TYDS, pages 37\u201338, 34 respectively). The complement suffix denote an incorrect pair or is out of sequence TYDS, pages 50\u201351) for example, 'ze' means send but 'zes' is bring. The diminutive suffix does not convey magnitude (TYDS, page 51), for example, 'do' for live, while 'dot' is visit). The use of a prefix conceals the Speedword because the first letter cannot be immediately recognised. These proposals would make Speedwords more easily recognisable because the elementary stem would be reliably recognisable. Apparently in the 1980s and 1990s some attempts were made to amend Speedword  shortcomings but they are no longer available for inspection and evaluation. Improvements depend upon reading Dutton publications from 1933 and 1951 which may disclose method and rationale.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.dict \"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\" ] transcribed by Richard Kennaway - approximately 3 000 Dutton Speedwords\n*[http://www.kafejo.com/lingvoj/auxlangs/dws/tral/index.php Dutton Speedwords Translator]\n*[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/ObjAndDesign.html Piashi] - a modern speedwords derivative\n*[http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2007/06/yublin-shorthand-for-speed-writing.html Yublin] - a shorthand based on similar principles, but optimized for notetaking compression rather than international dialogue\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120419115122/http://skegnessvideo.com/2009/02/dutton-v-pitman-shorthand-alleged-libel-lawsuit Dutton v Pitman (Shorthand) Alleged Libel Lawsuit] [link to archived article]\n*A list of all [http://revisy.com/s/4b/Dutton-Speedwords-1-One-letter-speed-words One Letter Dutton Speedwords]\n*A work-in-progress spreadsheet of Dutton Speedwords by Dr Gary R Oliver available from dr@well.com\n\n[[Category:Shorthand systems]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n[[Category:International auxiliary languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:1922 introductions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=December 2019}}\n{{Manual|date=December 2019}}\n{{Self-published|date=December 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox writing system\n|name        = Dutton Speedwords\n|type        = shorthand\n|SHform      = printed\n|typedesc    = and auxiliary language\n|creator     = [[Reginald J.

By '''Speedword''' Dutton meant a word in his constructed language.\"</ref> is an [[international auxiliary language]] as well as an abbreviated writing system using the English alphabet for all the languages of the world. It was devised by [[Reginald J. G. Dutton]] (born 8 November 1886 in Nottingham, UK; died 23 June 1970, Skegness, UK) who initially ran a shorthand college promoting Dutton Shorthand (a geometric script), then offered a mail order (correspondence) self-education course in Speedwords while still supporting the Dutton Shorthand. The business was continued by his daughter Elizabeth after his death.\n\n==Requirements for communication==\nAny transcription, note taking or correspondence system must fulfill six requirements (Oliver, 2019, Micro-intellectual capital: A case study of Dutton Speedwords):\n:1. Rules for ensuring an agreed vocabulary, how additions are included, and, how technical terms are expressed \n:2. Systematic method for representing the vocabulary including abbreviations or contractions or truncations, particularly where literal transcription is necessary\n:3. A pronunciation system that makes the vocalisation meaningful\n:4. A meaningful word order\n:5. Rule for designating or rejecting parts of speech\n:6. A method for learning the new system of communication\nIdeally, these requirements should not be wholly biased toward English but consider European, Asian and Middle East languages.\n\nThe system of Speedwords created over 50 years by Dutton addresses all these requirements. Other systems have copied the solutions devised by Dutton without greatly improving his approach. One major advantage of Dutton's Speedwords is that it is readily available to everyone. Its current competitors either require pre-payment for materials before revealing the full details of their system, or, have system that is a subset of the words necessary for a complete system.\n\n==Objectives of Speedwords==\nOver time, three objectives were claimed by Dutton for Speedwords:\n\nInitially, Dutton proposed Speedwords as an International Auxiliary Language (often abbreviated IAL) to encourage people to communicate internationally. Dutton wanted to provide a system so that a sender could use which did not require them to learn the (foreign) language used by the recipient before establishing communication. Speedwords achieves this by relying on a deliberately small vocabulary. For international communication, the writer and reader are different, so, it is important that communication is unambiguous.\n\nThen Dutton promoted Speedwords for high-speed writing. This used ideas and experience based on Dutton Shorthand. Dutton developed this stenographic method between 1919 and 1926. This approach also assumed that the writer and reader were different.\n\nUp to this time, Speedwords avoided synonyms. Synonyms are variants of the same English word and treated them as equivalent. There are two possibilities: (1) One Speedword for different parts of speech. For example, 'hon' refers to sincere, sincerely, sincerity). (2) The same Speedword covers several different English words (e.g., 'kla' means class, kind, or sort. There are also derivatives of Speedwords (e.g., 'bi' means life but there is also 'bie' lively, bik vital, 'bir' creature, 'biu' welfare, 'biv' spirit, 'bix' death, 'bixk' fatal, 'bixy' kill, 'bixya' murder.\n\nLater, realising that some writing required literal transcription, Dutton expanded the vocabulary to allow words which are synonyms that were required to precisely distinguish shades of meaning. Dutton offered two methods to distinguish these synonyms which were required for literal transcription. The first was to use an initial capital letter. The capital letter indicates the Speedword is being used to denote a specific word not the range of words covered by a Speedword. These were officially recognised by being listed in the Speedwords Dictionary. The second method was to underline the Speedword. Dutton does not detail how this would work so it is assumed that this was left to the discretion of the Speedwords user.\n\nFinally, Dutton promoted Speedwords for individual (personal) note writing and note reading. This approach assumed that the writer and reader were mostly the same person. Dutton encouraged this group of users to adopt some personal conventions to adapt it to their personal needs (e.g., underlining). The widely available \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\" (original 1951 edition and revised 1971 edition, but paragraph 4 in both editions) was focused on the note taking and note making objective although Dutton still claimed it could also be used to fulfill the other objectives.\n\nSee {{section link||Design_of_Speedwords}} below for how these objectives were used to construct Speedwords.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThere are three possible uses: writing, speaking including dictation, and, note taking\n\n===Writing ===\nThis was the original use intended by Dutton. Speedwords would allow peoples with different national languages to communicate using Speedwords as the medium. This would be accomplished because it had a compact vocabulary and rigid meanings to avoid ambiguity. All versions of Speedwords were customised for writing and minimising the number of letters that had to be written.\n\n===Speaking including dictation===\nCriticisms in 1935-6 of the predecessor of Speedwords (called International 2 Letter Script which had many combinations of consonants) were focused on the difficulty in pronouncing strings of consonants. Speedwords overcame this deficiency.\n\n===Note taking===\n\"[[Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords]]\" adapted Speedwords to note taking. It modified the standard Speedwords from written correspondence without any time pressure to allow taking notes at high speed.\n\n==Competitors to Speedwords==\nThere are three competitors to Speedwords. They are (1) shorthand as simplified letterforms, (2) shorthand as picture symbols, and, (3) shorthand using non-stenographic systems (that is, alphabetic characters).\n\nSimplified letterforms are also called stenographic [[shorthand]] systems. One type of letterform geometric is based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The most popular example is [[Pitman shorthand]] released 1837, and many lesser-known systems such as [[Boyd's syllabic shorthand]] originally published 1903, as well as predecessor systems such as [[Duployan Shorthand]]. These use symbols which do not represent letters, but rather sounds so the words are written more or less as they are spoken. Contrasted with geometric are script shorthands that are oriented around the movement of the hand when writing. The original is [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] which began in Germany and spread through Europe. Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands are a hybrid of geometric systems and the script systems. The notable example is [[Gregg shorthand]] first published in 1888. Other examples include [[Superwrite]], [[Easyscript]], [[Keyscript]], [[Speedwriting]], Quickscript, [[Breviogrph]], [[Stenoscript]] ABC, and [[Teeline]].\n\nPicture symbols were proposed by Austrian [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897\u20131985) who created [[Blissymbolics]] in 1949 as a universal written language for speakers of any language to learn and communicate. It avoided the problems of constructed quasi-European language like [[Esperanto]], or, natural languages such as English. [[Blissymbolics]] was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language but provided a basic vocabulary that could be spoken.\n\nNon-stenographic systems or alphabetic systems may also supplement the alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, give different meanings when letters are capitalised, or add non-alphabetic symbols. The most popular of these is [[Esperanto]]. Dutton contrasted Speedwords with its major rival [[Esperanto]] by claiming correctly that Speedwords had a smaller vocabulary and did not require the extensive study that was required to converse or write [[Esperanto]]. Another rapid writing system with a similar name, [[Speedwriting]] (also called Brief English Systems) was invented by Emma Dearborn at Simmons College, Columbia University and published in 1925. Her method used letters of the alphabet and some punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English which could be reproduced on the typewriter. Dearborn initially franchised teaching and then sold the rights which passed between various companies who made further changes and marketed it throughout the US and in various languages (e.g., Spanish). Other methods included [[Personal Shorthand]] also known as [[Briefscript]], and [[Keyscript]]. [[Forkner Shorthand]] was promoted as an alternative to [[Pitman Shorthand|Pitman]] shorthand from 1955\u20131995 but is no longer taught.\n\nThe benchmark for pronunciation is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) produced by the [[International Phonetic Association]]. It is easily printable by hand or keyboard although its conventions are often not used to depict pronunciation in dictionaries and other reference materials.\n\nThe major reason that Dutton Speedwords continues to receive attention is its strict alphabetical constraint that allows it to be used on a keyboard, and its breadth of practical application which Dutton embodied in his system.\n\n==Design of Speedwords==\nThe design of Speedwords has four features:\n:1. Unlike other shorthand methods, (e.g., Pitman, Gregg) which use new symbols, strokes or geometric shapes, Speedwords method uses the 26 letters of the English alphabet (upper and lower case) plus the ampersand symbol ('&'). \n:2. Unlike most other shorthand and rapid writing methods, Speedwords has its roots in a shorthand system that Dutton found cumbersome and which he believed he overcome by using alphabetic characters.\n:3. Unlike other shorthand and rapid writing systems, Dutton emphasised the speed of learning.\n:4. Like other shorthand systems, Dutton sought to maximise speed and minimise the amount of writing.\n\n==Principles of Speedwords==\nIn all publications, Dutton describes various principles of Speedwords but there is no consolidated list of principles. They can be summarised as:\n:1. Select its vocabulary from the entire Indo-European language family, particularly maximising the internationality of words, that is, selecting a word that is common between languages, (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 90).\n:2. Abbreviate those words guided by a 1925 analysis by Horn on the frequency of words. The most frequently used words were allocated the shorted abbreviation. So the most frequent words have just one letter (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 5).\n:3. Structure the vocabulary around high frequency words. A 1,000 word vocabulary handles 85% of daily conversation while a 3,000 word vocabulary handles 98% of daily conversation so Speedwords only needs a simple rule for 2% of its vocabulary. Dutton seems to suggest that the solution is to write out the word in full.\n:4. Make one Speedword have only one meaning which results in a basic vocabulary which Dutton calls 'keywords' (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 7).\n:5. Avoid grammatical differences, so a keyword can also refer to noun, verb, adjective, adverb (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 5).\n:6. Create other meanings by adding suffixes to show relationships or create antonyms (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 3).\n\nWhile this approach is sound it has both advantages and a few disadvantages discussed below.\n\nSpeedwords was meant to be written and spoken, so Dutton provided some guidelines on pronunciation which is included below.\n\n==Advantages==\nIn Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, Dutton claims at least eight benefits from Speedwords:\n:1. Knowing just a few Speedwords (he means the one letter Speedwords) allows immediate savings in time and effort (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords 1951, page 7). The words can be substituted for the English equivalents as the Speedwords vocabulary is learnt. This contrasts with geometric shorthand shapes that require the entire system to be mastered.\n:2. It uses the English alphabet. This means it Speedwords can be written or typed (TYDS, page 8).\n:3. It uses a range of Indo-European words. So, its vocabulary has an \"international currency\" (page 87). \n:4. Speedwords are chosen based on the frequency of usage. This means that the most frequently used words are the shortest (TYDS, page 7).\n:5. Correspondence can be exchanged although the individual writers without having to learn the foreign language of all their many correspondents. This means the writers can be ignorant of the language of their correspondent (TYDS, page 8).\n:6. Knowing speed words takes between 20 and 30 hours (TYDS, pages 9, 90). The work of learning \"is a fascinating pastime and in no sense an arduous task\" (TYDS, page 9)\n:7. Speedwords makes 5 out of 6 words far shorter (page 87). This increases the speed of writing and note taking approximately 100-120 words per minute (page 137) or up to 150 wpm (page 8).\n:8. The 'hurdle' to overcome language barriers is considerably reduced because the Speedwords vocabulary is small. The basic vocabulary is 493 words (page 89). The more extensive vocabulary is 1,000 words (page 142)\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe disadvantages appear to be:\n:1. No-one is developing Speedwords, so authoritative information about it is now hard to find, except for the Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book. Some have taken Speedwords and adapted it. For example, see Briefscript by Ray Brown at <ref>http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/index.html</ref> \n:2. The Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book does not have a full discussion of pronunciation which Dutton suggests is essential to using Speedwords. Hearsay is that Dutton had a simplified pronunciation system which may have been shared with some inquirers after his death, but it was never published\n:3. Dutton did not disclose the rules he used to formulate Speedwords so some apparent anomalies and obscurities exist. So, Dutton appears to make arbitrary decisions on the choice of a Speedword. For example, on page 25 Dutton states that 'ao' means 'away' although 'ax' would be logical. However, 'ax' has already been used to mean 'ask'. This shows that over 50 years Dutton had not reached 100% perfection of his system. This is consistent with the effort required to be expended to fully complete as shown by the [[Pareto Principle]]. Also, on TYDS, page 25 Dutton used the Speedword 'dy' for since but gives the rationale French 'depuis' but it does not contain 'y' and in French could also translate to 'for' which has the Speedword 'f'.\n:4. Some guidelines stated in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book are difficult to apply. For example, Dutton allows the reader to use synonyms for the basic Speedwords and distinguishes them from the basic speedwords by capitalising their first letter. Also, for example, English 'at' becomes the Speedword 'A' because Speedword 'a' means 'to' (TYDS, page72). Dutton says the reader can create her or his own supplementary list but does not detail how this is done or how she or he manages it.\n\nNone of these disadvantages prevent its successful use for personal note taking.\n\n==Achievements of Dutton==\nDutton Speedwords continues to be referred to despite its orphan status because of his achievements:\n:1. He preferred to keep the vocabulary compact using frequency of use as the criteria.\n:2. He provided a proven learning approach (incremental learning with repetition) which makes it easy to master.\n:3. He persevered with it over a long period (1933\u20131970) so it was refined with experience and feedback.\n\n==Evolution of speedwords==\nIt appears that Speedwords developed in five main stages:\n:1. As a competitor to Pitman and Gregg shorthand. Based on the available Dutton shorthand publications held in libraries this occurred 1919\u20131925. At this point, it was a geometric shorthand method that competed with Pitman and Gregg shorthand methods and did not use the English alphabet.\n:2. Under the influence of Horn's frequently used words list, an early attempt was made to develop an alternate international abbreviated language. Dutton expressed this in his one-page sheet called International 2-letter correspondence symbols (published 1933).\n:3. Further development occurred to create an alternate international language. It began in 1935 when International 2-letter correspondence symbols were revised and reissued in 1935 as International Symbolic Script. Another version called Word Speedwords was published between 1941\u20131945 (page 18 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). There is a booklet of the same name published in 1946 which appears to contain 100 Speedwords. Despite attempts by Dutton to popularise World Speedwords it was not adopted as an international language. The intention expressed on page 88 in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (1951) to produce language-specific versions of the Speedwords course, did not eventuate. It appears another variation called Dutton Youth Speedwords was published in 1943. Both World Speedwords and Speedwords used words from Flemish (Dutch), French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Scandinavia, Slav, and Spanish are sources for both World Speedwords and Speedwords (According to pages 8, and 88 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951 and 1971).\n:4. By 1946 it had been renamed Speedwords. By 1951 Dutton conceded that Speedwords was ideal for individual note taking and note making (page 7 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords) and made some variations to Word Speedwords to adapt it for the new purpose (page 8 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). His audience is, therefore, students and time-poor people seeking to make the best use of their time or people who incur high costs in communication. He comments that he hopes that \"the student who has worked through the present course will look to this wide horizon (page 88) that is, international communication so Dutton always maintained his duality of objectives and functions.\n:5. It has been revived from time to time in its own right as well as with adaptations. The Dutton Society (no longer extant) promoted Speedwords. Some time management writers and computer specialists who describe online applications including e-mail and situations where communication is either slow or expensive.\n\n==Foreign language versions of Speedwords==\nIn Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (page 88), Dutton says that \"It is intended to publish this Speedwords course in all the major languages of both hemispheres.\"\n\nThis did not occur. It is unclear whether the impediment was (a) problems that equivalents (including the use of suffixes) were not suitable in foreign languages, (b) authors of the foreign language versions of Speedwords were not forthcoming, (c) lack of a publisher, or (d) anomalies and difficulties became apparent when Speedwords was translated making the English and foreign language version no longer in uniform.\n\n==Sources describing Dutton Speedwords==\nThere are three main sources of information about Speedwords: (1) Speedwords publications issued by Dutton, (2) the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book in the [[Teach Yourself]] series and (3) third party publications and commentaries (see the references).\n\n===Dutton publications===\n\nAll the Dutton Speedwords booklets published between 1933 and 1951 are out of print. Very few libraries show holdings of copies. Helpful booklets used in preparing this page were the Speedwords dictionary.<ref name=ename3>\"Dutton, Reginald 1945 Dutton Speedwords Dictionary, (Third edition). London: Dutton Publications\"</ref> It consists of 4,000 basic and with derivatives 10,000 English-Speedword and Speedword-English words.\n\nA more accessible version focused on note taking and note making called Dutton Speedwords was published in 1951 in the Teach Yourself series published by English Universities Press as a hardcover. It was reprinted in 1959 and 1962 (with the distinctive yellow dustjacket for both years). A revised edition was published in 1971. It was reissued in 1973 as a paperback. The only revisions made in 1971 were in Part 1 of the high-speed vocabulary appendix (pages 137\u2013147). Part 2 of the High-Speed appendix which is aimed solely at English speakers was unchanged between the original 1951 and revised 1971 editions. Copies of the 1951 and 1971 editions are relatively easy to find second hand. The 1951 edition and its 1962 reprint are printed on higher quality paper than the updated 1971/1973 edition which has yellowed pages that easily tear. Both editions have misprints. This is an incomplete list:\n:1. Paragraph number 83 occurs twice: once in Lesson 8, and, also in the High-Speed Appendix.\n:2. Lists in Speedwords are frequently not in alphabetical order: for example, 'fon' and 'for' in the Alphabetic Speedwords list is out of order (page 94).\n\n===Third party publications===\nThe references below list some third-party publications and commentaries that are still available. Many other webpages have been lost and are no longer available. These missing webpages included the Dutton Society, the Robert Petry pages when he was promoting Speedwords in approximately 1997, and pages by the New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. who promised a new revised edition of Dutton's Speedwords. However, there is no record of a library holding the reissued publication by New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z.\n\n==Timeline of Speedwords==\nDutton was assiduous in developing Speedwords and its predecessor Dutton shorthand. After developing Dutton shorthand, Dutton continued to improve it. But then realising the shortcomings of using shorthand, Dutton develops Dutton Shorthand. Dutton Shorthand was also revised many times. Dutton never gave up refining Speedwords, advocating its merits, and offering it for sale and as a correspondence course.\n\nBelow is a selection of publications that Dutton produced over his lifetime.\n\n===Shorthand publications===\n: 1915 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (First edition).\n: 1916 Dutton Shorthand as a competitor [to [[Pitman Shorthand|Pitman]] and [[Gregg shorthand|Gregg]] shorthand called \"Shorthand in Three Days\" [with Key].\n: 1917 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (Second edition).

Skegness: Dutton's.\n: 1935 reprint (?) of International 2 Letter Script\nThis publication is described by Dutton in an article to the Royal Society. It uses one letter of the English alphabet which was assigned to a class of meaning, apparently directly inspired by Roget's Thesaurus. There was no pronunciation system and criticisms of this omission resulted in Speedwords.\n\n===Speedwords publications===\n: 1935 Unknown title which converts International 2 Letter Script into Speedwords\n: 1940 480 Speedwords\n: 1940? 100 speedwords with 20 exercises (with World Speedwords as the title on page 3)\n: 1940?

These are Speedword stems or elements (TYDS, page 88, 89, 137).\n* 1,000 Speedwords. These are the most frequently used words (TYDS, page 141).\n* 4,000 Speedwords. These are the words in the Speedwords Dictionary (TYDS, page 87).\n* 10,000 Speedwords. These are derivatives of Speedwords (TYDS, page 91).\n\n===Method of learning===\nSpeedwords was taught as a correspondence course by both Dutton and his daughter in the pre and post-war period. Their course was supported by an extensive array of booklets that he had developed. Many of the booklets are listed in the timeline section. The option of enrolling in a course offered directly by Dutton's organisation or third parties is no longer available.\n\nSeveral system such as [[Forkner shorthand]] emphasised replacing some longhand writing with shortcuts as soon as they begin studying the system. Many systems also claimed it was possible to achieve dictation rates above 50 words per minute. These all have learning times of a year or more.\n\nLearning Dutton Speedwords takes around a week to a fortnight. In TYDS (page 9) Dutton cites his records which show that learning the takes between 20 and 24 hours with 30 hours being the maximum. Dutton agrees that individual Speedwords can be substituted one or two at a time. However, Dutton believes that the entire Speedwords system can be learnt quickly and therefore it is not necessary to learn it piecemeal.\n\nSome websites provide summaries of Speedwords (that is, the one and two-letter Speedwords). Some websites provide illustrations or highlights of the method. They are not recommended because they either mis-state Dutton or are incomplete. The chief characteristic of Dutton Speedwords is its detail and the extensive guidelines Dutton provides in his booklets.\n\n===Resources for learning===\n\nA few lucky people may be able to read some of the Speedwords booklets Dutton published between 1940\u20131951. The booklets promote the other booklets which were available but do not explain their interrelationship. So this is a brief description on how to use them. Essentially there are four interrelated booklets. All four are required. They are: (1) The \"textbook\". (2) The \"companion\". It provides additional exercises and the answers to exercises in the textbook. (3) The \"supplement\". It provides further exercises with answers to enhance learning through additional practice (4) The bi-lingual vocabulary. This is an alphabetic list of Speedwords (between 3,00 and 10,000 depending upon the edition) with their English equivalent, as well as an English-to-Speedwords lookup list. The vocabulary contains an introductory commentary by Dutton which is valuable for understanding and using the dictionary. Depending upon when they were published, they may be called \"Dutton Speedwords, \"Dutton Double Speedwords\", \"Duttom Youth Speedwords\" or \"Dutton World Speeedwords\". They were published at different times with different titles and contain minor differences. There is usually more than one edition of each. Later editions (1946 or preferably 1951) are the most complete and up-to-date. They usually contain an explanation of any changes made in the latest edition.\n\nThe most common authoritative source is \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\". It is focused on note taking (page 2, paragraph 4). It contains eight lessons, an appendix and a dictionary with about 1,00 speedwords.\n\n==International versus English/domestic use of Speedwords==\nOne important factor that can affect learning is whether communication is between speakers of Indo-European languages. Learning Speedwords is affected by background. It is oriented to the English language in its vocabulary and sentence construction. Dutton claims (TYDS, page 90) that memorisation will be slower for non-Indo-European language speakers, they will be able to extend their vocabulary as easily once the vocabulary is mastered. This means the learner must always be conscious of whether Dutton is describing Speedwords to be used in international communication or the English only use.\n\nThe English-only use makes concessions that are counterproductive to international communication. Those concessions can be summarised as:\n:1. Using selected synonyms found in English which are designated by the word being given a capital letter. For example, 'O' for 'sir' (TYDS, page 35, para 35).\n:2. Recognising an even wider range of synonyms and additional words that are not distinguished in any way from the internationally usable Speedwords (See, for example, TYDS, pages 148-154).\n:3. Abbreviating some Speedwords (contractions) which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'Bil' for 'bill' when there already is 'bil' used for 'account'.\n:4. Using Speedwords with abbreviations which will be meaningless in international use. For example, omit the 'i' from 'bil' (TYDS, page 141, para 85).\n:5. Creating compounds with additional suffixes. For example, the new suffix '-c' is used to -tion, tious, -cious, -tial, ture, -sure while '-m' is used to express -ment, (TYS, page 152, rule 14).\n:6. Creating compounds of Speedwords which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'ze' + 'nav' is abbreviated 'zev' (page 56, para 60).\nConsequently, the learner of Speedwords needs to be aware that some of the extensions they make and use, may inhibit rather than facilitate international communication.\n\n==Lexicon==\nThe principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see [[information theory]]). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots also called parent words in the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book:\n\n:''a'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} \"at, to\" (< French ''\u00e0'')\n:''b'' {{IPA|[b\u028at]}} \"but, butt\" (< English)\n:''c'' {{IPA|[t\u0283\u0259/t\u0283i]}} \"this\" (< French ''ce'')\n:''d'' {{IPA|[d\u0259/di]}} \"of, from\" (< French ''de'')\n:''e'' {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} \"to be, is, am, are\" (< French ''est'')\n:''f'' {{IPA|[fro\u02d0]}} \"for\" (< English)\n:''g'' {{IPA|[\u0261\u0259/\u0261i]}} \"they, them\"\n:''h'' {{IPA|[hi\u02d0]}} \"has, have\" (< English?)\n:''i'' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} \"in, within\" (< English)\n:''j'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259/\u0292i]}} \"I, me\" (< French ''je'')\n:''k'' {{IPA|[k\u0259/ki]}} \"that\" [conjunction] (< French ''que'')\n:''l'' {{IPA|[l\u0259/li]}} \"the\" (< French ''le'')\n:''m'' {{IPA|[m\u026at]}} \"with\" (< German ''mit'')\n:''n'' {{IPA|[n\u0254t]}} \"no, not\" (< English)\n:''o'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} \"on\" (< English)\n:''p'' {{IPA|[p\u0259/pi]}} \"can, to be able\" (< French ''peut'')\n:''q'' {{IPA|[kw\u0259/kwi]}} \"do (question particle), question, query\" (< English)\n:''r'' {{IPA|[r\u0259/ri]}} \"will, shall\" (< ?)\n:''s'' {{IPA|[s\u0259/si]}} \"he, him\" (< French ''se'')\n::''sh'' {{IPA|[\u0283\u0259/\u0283i]}} \"she, her\" (< English)\n:''t'' {{IPA|[t\u0259/ti]}} \"it\" (< English)\n:''u'' {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} \"a, an, one\" (< Latin ''unus'')\n:''v'' {{IPA|[v\u0259/vi]}} \"you\" (< French ''vous'')\n:''w'' {{IPA|[w\u0259/wi]}} \"we, us\" (< English)\n:''x'' {{IPA|[\u026aks]}} \"whether, if\" \n:''y'' {{IPA|[jo\u02d0]}} \"was, were\" \n:''z'' {{IPA|[zu\u02d0]}} \"as, then\" (< English? \"zen\"?)\n:''&'' {{IPA|[and]}} \"and\" (< English)\n\nSome two- and three-letter words are\n\n:good -- ''gu''\n:know -- ''sa''\n:love -- ''am''\n:beautiful -- ''bel''\n:language -- ''lin''\n:game, play -- ''lud''\n\n(Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots &mdash;''sapio'', ''amo'', ''bellus'', ''lingua'', ''ludus''&mdash;as are \"room\" and \"sleep\" below&mdash;''camera'' and ''dormio''&mdash;while \"good\" and the root for \"air\" below come from [[German language|German]]: ''gut'', ''luft''.)\n\nThe few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix ''-a'' indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, ''bixy'' = kill, ''bixya'' = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ''ky + luf'' (eat + air) to mean \"picnic\". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter  ''r'' indicates future tense and ''y'' indicates past. Thus,  ''j sa'' = I know, ''j ysa'' = I knew, ''j r sa'' = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (''bel'' = \"beautiful\" and \"beautifully\"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ''ca + dor'' (room + sleep) = bedroom.\n\n==Phonology and orthography==\nDutton orthography is irregular.  It is combined with phonology below.\n\n===Stress===\nStress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix ''-o'' is always stressed, and the verbal prefixes ''u-'' (present participle) and ''y-'' (past tense) are never stressed.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation], page 1. Compiled by Raymond Brown from \"Dutton World Speedwords\" (3rd ed. 1946) and \"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text\" (3rd ed. 1946).</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nVowels are rather similar to Latin.  When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise, it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation], pages 1 & 2.</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Letter||a||e||i||o||u||au||y|| -\n|-\n!Long\n|\"ah\"<br>{{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}\n|\"eh\"<br>{{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}\n|\"ee\"<br>{{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}\n|\"oh\"<br>{{IPA|[o\u02d0]}}\n|\"oo\"<br>{{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}\n|rowspan=2|\"ow\"<br>{{IPA|[au\u032f]}}\n|rowspan=2|\"m'''igh'''t\"<br>{{IPA|[ai\u032f]}}\n|rowspan=2|\"sof'''a'''\"<br>{{IPA|[\u0259]}}\n|-\n!Short\n|\"'''a'''t\"<br>{{IPA|[a]}}<ref>The 'short a' is probably meant to be the northern English and Midlands [a] rather than southern English [\u04d5]; see Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 1</ref>\n|\"g'''e'''t\"<br>{{IPA|[\u025b]}}\n|\"'''i'''t\"<br>{{IPA|[\u026a]}}\n|\"'''o'''d\"<br>{{IPA|[\u0254]}}\n|\"p'''u'''t\"<br>{{IPA|[\u028a]}}\n|}\n\nVowel length for the most part not phonemic, but are determined by position.  However, there is morphophonemic contrast in a few cases where a root word contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel.  For example,\n:''pad'' {{IPA|[pa\u02d0d]}} \"paid\" (''pa'' \"pay\" + ''-d'' passive participle) vs ''pad'' {{IPA|[pad]}} \"pad\";\n:''sud\" {{IPA|[su\u02d0d]}} \"improved' ('' \"su\" + ''-d'' passive participle) vs ''sud'' {{IPA|[s\u028ad]}} \"sudden\".<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#Vowels Speedwords pronunciation is complicated: Vowels]</ref>\n\nOnly ''au'' and ''y'' are diphthongs.  Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. ''eis'' \"ice\" is {{IPA|[\u02c8e\u02d0.\u026as]}}.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 1 \"CHECK YOUR PRONUNCIATION 364</ref> Vowel sequences in roots are ''ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu''.  The sequences ''ie, uo'' are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way since all written contractions should be pronounced in full.\n\n\"Y\" is a consonant in ''ye'' {{IPA|[j\u025b]}} \"yes\" and in ''y'' {{IPA|[\u02c8jo\u02d0]}} \"was, were\" only.\n\n===Consonants===\nConsonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., ''s'' is always voiceless, as in \"less\", ''g'' is always hard, as in \"get\", and ''r'' is trilled, as in Scots and Italian.  Exceptions:\n*''c'' is {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} (as in \"i'''tch'''\")\n*''j'' is {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in French)\n*''q'' is {{IPA|[kw]}} (as in \"'''qu'''ick\")\n*''sh'' is {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in English)\n*''x'' is {{IPA|[ks]}} (as in English)\n\nWords spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a \"very short ee\" before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise, clearly mirroring Dutton's pronunciation of the ''e'' in \"the.\"<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 5</ref>  The suffixes ''-r'' (agent) and ''-z'' (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 371, 372</ref>\n\n{{IPA|[\u0292, h]}} do not occur in final position.<ref>Lack of final {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is presumably an accidental gap; there is also no suffix ''j''.  Lack of final {{IPA|[h]}} reflects English phonotactics.</ref>  {{IPA|[\u0283]}} only occurs in final position in an unwritten affix.  A nasal {{IPA|[\u014b]}} occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either.  (See below.)  {{IPA|[j]}} occurs initially in just two words, ''ye'' and ''y''; finally it arguably ends the diphthong ''y''.  The letter ''w'' does not occur in final position, but {{IPA|[w]}} arguably ends the diphthong ''au''.\n\nConsonant sequences in word-initial position are ''bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q'' [kw], ''sp, st''.  The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is ''tt'' in ''otto'' \"eight\".  Consonant sequences in word-final position are ''nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk<!--search 'erk'-->, rm, rn, st, sk, and x'' [ks]. But ''aq'', though written with final consonant, is pronounced {{IPA|['akw\u0259]}}).<ref>\"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book, PRONUNCIATION LIST\" where Dutton gives the pronunciation as ''akwe(r)''</ref>\n\n===Unwritten consonants and vowels===\nSome morphemes spelled with a single consonant have an unwritten vowel, and one prefix spelled with a single vowel has an unwritten consonant:\n*''b'' \"but\" is {{IPA|[b\u028at]}}, as in English \"but\"<ref>Presumably with the northern English pronunciation, as Dutton states short ''u'' is the sound of 'u' in \"put\"</ref>\n*''-c'' (a suffix) is {{IPA|[t\u0283o\u02d0]}}, as if it were written ''co''.

It is very unlikely Dutton would have kept ''h'' and ''hi'' as homophones; but we are not told how ''h'' is now to be pronounced.\n\nNote: ''h'' (and its past tense ''hy'' and present participle ''hu'') is used only as an auxiliary verb; \"have/has\" in the sense of \"have/has got\" is ''ha'' {{IPA|[ha\u02d0]}} <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 23 & 25 (\u00a7\u00a750, 51, 52), and page 28 (\u00a770)</ref>\n\nSome suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants.  They are detailed below.\n\n===Affixes===\nAs noted above, the prefixes past-tense ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} and ''u-'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b]}} do not take stress, and ''u-'' is pronounced with an unwritten engma.  ''Me-'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0]}} and ''my-'' {{IPA|[mai\u032f]}} also remain unstressed when forming comparatives and superlatives, e.g. ''mebel'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0'b\u025bl]}} \"more beautiful\", ''mybel'' {{IPA|[mai\u032f'b\u025bl]}} \"most beautiful\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page62, \u00a7308</ref>\n\nSuffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} (English ''y'') when following a vowel.  For example, ''gree'' \"awfully, extremely\" (< ''are + e'') is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8gre\u02d0je\u02d0]}}, ''mua'' \"too (much)\" (< ''mua + a'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8mu\u02d0ja\u02d0]}} and ''dau'' \"allow, grant\" (< ''da + u'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8da\u02d0ju\u02d0]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 368</ref>\n\nThe suffixes ''-n'' and ''-st'' are derived from the speedwords ''un'' \"negative\" and ''its'' \"professional\" and are always pronounced in full and take an epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} when following a vowel, e.g. ''gan'' \"scarcely\" (< ''ga + n'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0j\u028an]}} and ''rist'' \"clerk\" (< ''ri + st'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8ri\u02d0j\u026ast]}}.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375</ref>\n\nThe words ''co'' \"collect, collection\" and ''za'' \"dear, endearment, intimate\" may also be used as suffixes; if appended to a word ending in a vowel, they do not shorten that vowel, e.g. ''lec'' \"correspondence, mail\" is {{IPA|[\u02c8le\u02d0t\u0283o\u02d0]}} and ''perza'' \"dad(dy), papa\" is {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u025brza\u02d0]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375</ref>\n\nSuffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel.  The exceptions are ''-d, -z, -r'', which leave the vowel long.  (As noted above, ''-z'' and ''-r'' take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.)  Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:\n*''-d'' is pronounced {{IPA|[d]}} after vowels and voiced consonants but ''d'', and {{IPA|[\u025bd]}} after ''d'' and voiceless consonants.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 370</ref>\n*''-m'' (derived from the word ''om'' \"article, object, thing\") shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0254m]}} after any consonant, e.g. ''dam'' \"donation, gift, present\" (< ''da + m'') is {{IPA|[dam]}} and ''tegm'' \"cover, lid\" (< ''teg + m'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8teg\u0254m]}} <ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 373</ref>\n*Other single-consonant suffixes - ''-b'' (< ''ib'' \"possible\"), ''-g'' (< ''ig'' \"general\"), ''-k'' (< ''ik'' \"property, quality\", ''-l'' (< ''il'' \"particular (e)special\", ''-p'' (< ''ep'' \"location, place, position, set, put\"), ''-s'' (< ''is'' \"complement\") and ''-t'' (< ''et'' \"little, small\") - shorten the preceding vowel and, when they \"can be articulated without difficulty\" are pronounced as a single consonant after another consonant, otherwise they are pronounced in full as the words from they are derived after other consonants.  Dutton adds that ''-s'' must always be pronounced {{IPA|[\u026as]}} after word ending in ''-k'' or ''-g'' \"to avoid confusion with the suffix ''-x''.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 2, Suffixes 374</ref>\n\nIn addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#SCS Speedwords Single consonant suffixes]</ref>\n*''-f'' after vowels and ''-y'' after consonants\n*''-v'' after vowels and ''-i'' after consonants \n*''-x'' after vowels and ''-o'' after consonants\n''f'' ~ ''-y'' are obviously abstracted from ''fy'' \"cause, make, reason, render\"; the pairs ''-v'' ~ ''-i'' and ''-x'' ~ ''-o'' appear to be arbitrary creations.\n\nAlso in the pre-1951 version of Speedwords, Dutton gave the apostrophe as a possessive suffix pronounced {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}}, e.g. ''l mant'kap'' {{IPA|[l\u0259'mantzai\u032fkap]}} \"the boy's head\".  But in the 1951 Dictionary Dutton list a new root word ''zy'' {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}} \"disease\".  It is inconceivable that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe homophonous with ''zy'' \"disease.\" The apostrophe is retained in \"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\" (1951, 1971) but there is no indication how this is to be pronounced.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 3, The Possessive Case</ref>\n\n===Irregularities to avoid homophones===\nThe only examples specifically given by Dutton are:\n# \"away\" as an opposite of directional a \"to\" is ao [a\u02d0'jo\u02d0] as *ax would be homophonous with ax \"ask.\" <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 23, \u00a749</ref>\n# The agent suffix ''-r'' (< ''er'' \"person\") is written as the full word and pronounced with an epenthetic  {{IPA|[j]}}, when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word.  For example, \"maker\" is ''maer'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u02d0j\u025br]}} to avoid confusion with ''mar'' {{IPA|[mar]}} \"marry, marriage\" (In \"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book\", Dutton also gives ''jeer'' \"judge\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0292u\u02d0j\u025br]}} to avoid confusion with ''jur'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u028ar]}} \"law, legal\"; in the 1951 Dictionary, however, \"judge\" is given as ''just'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0292u\u02d0j\u026ast]}}\n\nFollowing 2 above, we may reasonably assume that if adding ''-b, -c, -g, -k, -l, -m, -n, -p, -s'' or ''-t'', then the full word from which these are derived would have been written and pronounced with an epenthetic  {{IPA|[j]}}, thus *''noib'' \"noticeable\" {{IPA|[\u02c8no\u02d0j\u026ab]}} to avoid confusion with ''nob'' \"celebrated, honour, note, repute\" {{IPA|[n\u0254b]}}.\n\nFollowing 1 above, we may reasonably assume that this would always be the case if by adding ''-x'' a homophone would have been created.  We may also assume that the same would apply to the ''-v'' ~ ''-i'' pair, i.e. if by adding ''-v'' we had a homophone, we must add ''-i'' {{IPA|[\u02c8ji\u02d0}} instead; the same well have applied to the ''-f'' ~ ''y'' pair, i.e. if by adding ''-f'' we had a homophone, we must add ''-y'' {IPA|[\u02c8jai\u032f}} instead; but as these suffixes derive from the word ''fy'', it may be that Dutton, following 1 above, would have added ''-fy''.<ref>Raymond Brown [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html#SCS Speedwords Single consonant suffixes]</ref>\n\n===Compound words===\nWhen two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[\u014b]}} is placed after the first root.  When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[\u0283]}} is placed after the first root.  Either affix takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[\u026a]}} after a consonant.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedword Pronunciation], page 3, Idea Compounds 377 & 378</ref>   Examples:\n\n:''albe'' \"already\" (< ''al + be'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8al\u026a\u014bbe\u02d0]}}\n:''diel'' \"telephone\" (< ''di + el'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8di\u02d0\u014b\u025bl]}}\n:''rysan'' \"hospital\" (< ''ry + san'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8rai\u032f\u014bsan]}}\n:''opmekav'' \"anti-aircraft\" (< ''op + mek + av'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0254p\u026a\u0283m\u025bkav]}} 'OPP-ish-mek-avv'\n:''ryefki'' \"gymnasium\" (< ''ry + ef + ki'') is {{IPA|[\u02c8rai\u032f\u0283\u025bfki\u02d0]}}\n\n==Morphology and syntax==\nRoot words may function as adjectives, nouns, verb or adverbs.  In \"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\" (1951, London, Dutton Publications) we read:\n\"The English language, like most other natural languages, is inconsistent in having separate words for the adjective 'hot' and the noun 'heat' whereas the same word 'cold' can function as either a noun or an adjective according to its context.  What applies to 'cold' can logically apply also to 'hot'; consequently the Speedword ''he'' denotes either 'heat' or 'hot', according to circumstance. ...\n\n\"Just as there is no distinction in English between the noun 'cold' and the adjective 'cold', so there is none between the adjective 'fast' and the adverb 'fast' (there being no English word 'fastly' corresponding to 'slowly').  What applies to the adjective 'fast' can logically apply also to other qualifiers, and consequently, there is no necessity to differentiate between, say, 'beautiful' and 'beautifully'. This means that, in international correspondence, the Speedword ''bel'' can convey not only 'beauty' and 'beautiful' ... but 'beautifully' as well ...\n\n\"Verbs and nouns are similarly interchangeable, for in the same way that each of the English words 'work', 'answer' and 'praise' can function either as a verb or noun according to its environment, so can any other word have a dual role.  In English the noun form of the verb 'fail' is 'failure', and of 'pay' 'payment'; but in everyday expressions such as 'without fail' and 'in his pay' the unnecessary distinction has been eliminated ... the Soeedword policy is to cut the Gordian knot and make ''pa'' mean either 'pay' or 'payment', ''pre'' either 'prepare' or 'preparation', ''kok'' 'cook' or 'cookery', ''men'' 'remember' to 'memory', and so on throughout.\" <ref>\"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\", pages 5 & 6</ref>\n\nThere are, however, grammatical affixes pertinent to particular parts of speech.\n\n===Verb affixes===\nThe present tense is unmarked, e.g. ''j spe'' {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259 'spe\u02d0]}} \"I speak\".\nThe past is marked by the unstressed prefix ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}}, e.g. ''j yspe'' {{IPA|[\u0292i ai\u032f'spe\u02d0]}} \"I spoke\".\n\nTwo verbs are irregular:<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 34, \u00a7\u00a7110, 111, 112</ref>\n*to be: ''e'' {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} \"be, am. is, are\"; ''y'' {{IPA|[jo\u02d0]}} \"was, were\".\n*to have ('''perfect auxiliary'''): ''h'' (post-1951 pronunciation unknown) \"has, have\"; ''hy'' {{IPA|[hai\u032f]}} \"had\".\n\nThe unmarked form also serves as the infinitive,  e.g.''sh am spe'' {{IPA|[\u0283i'am 'spe\u02d0]}} \"she loves to speak\" <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 13, \u00a72</ref>\n\nThere are two participles:\n: Present participle has prefix ''u-'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b]}}, e.g. ''uspe'' {{IPA|[\u028a\u014b'spe\u02d0]}} \"speaking\"\n: Perfect participle has suffix ''-d'' {{IPA|[d, \u025bd]}}, e.g. ''sped'' {{IPA|[spe\u02d0d]}} \"spoken\"\n\nOnly one irregular verb: the present participle of the auxiliary ''h'' is ''hu''  {{IPA|[h\u028a\u014b]}}<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 53 \u00a7241</ref>\n\nNote: Dutton is quite clear that the prefix ''u'' forms a '''participle''', i.e. a verbal adjective, e.g. ''u uspe tem'' {{IPA|[u\u02d0 \u028a\u014b'spe\u02d0 tem]}} 'a speaking clock', ''l ura on'' {{IPA|[li \u028a\u014b'ra\u02d0 '\u0254n]}} \"the working man.\"   Indeed, he devotes five paragraphs to hammer this point home.<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 53, \u00a7\u00a7237-241.</ref>\n\nDutton devotes six paragraphs<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 59 7 60, \u00a7\u00a7292-297</ref> to hammer home the difference between the English gerund (verbal noun) and the present participle.  He is adamant that forms prefixed with ''u-'' may be used ''only'' as a present participle.  In Speedwords the ''gerund must be expressed by the same form as the infinitive'', i.e. the unmarked verb, e.g. ''g amt spe'' {{IPA|[\u0261i 'amt spe\u02d0d}} \"they like speaking\", ''gi ko & go''  {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0 'ko\u02d0 and 'go\u02d0]}} \"their coming and going\"\n\nFurthermore\n:the continuous tenses are formed with \"to be\" and the unmarked verb, e.g. ''s e ri'' {{IPA|[si 'e\u02d0 'ri\u02d0]}} \"he is writing\"; ''w y ri'' {{IPA|[w\u0259 'jo\u02d0 'ri\u02d0]}} \"we were writing\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", pages 47 & 48, \u00a7\u00a7198-200</ref>\n:the perfect tenses are form with the auxiliary ''h'' and the unmarked verb, e.g. ''s h ri'' \"he has written''; ''g hy spe'' \"they had spoken\".<ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\", page 23, \u00a750</ref>\n\n===Noun affixes===\nThe plural, ''where necessary'', is shown by the suffix ''-z'', e.g. ''femz'' {{IPA|['f\u025bm\u0259z]}} \"women\".  Dutton is emphatic that if it is clear from context that the noun must be plural, the ending ''-z'' is not used, e.g. ''ud fem'' {{IPA|[\u028ad 'f\u025bm]}} \"many women\"; ''cz on'' {{IPA|[t\u0283\u0259z '\u0254n]}} <ref>\"Dutton World Speedwords\"\", page 55 & 56, \u00a7\u00a7250-260</ref>\n\nIn the pre-1951 version pf Speedwords, the possessive of nouns is {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}}, and written with an apostrophe, e.g. ''l fem' ryg'' {{IPA|l\u0259 'f\u025bmzai\u032f 'rai\u032f\u0261]}} \"the woman's house\"; but in 1951, Dutton introduced a new root word ''zy'' {{IPA|[zai\u032f]}} meaning \"disease\".  It is very unlikely that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe with the same sound.  But we do not know what he subsequently did.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/Speedwords%20pronunciation.pdf Dutton Speedwords Pronunciation], page 3</ref>\n\n===Adjective/ Adverb affixes===\n:''me-'' {{IPA|[\u02c8me\u02d0]}} comparative, more, -er (< ''me'' greater, increase, more), e.g. ''mebel'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0'b\u025bl]}} \"more beautiful(ly)\"\n:''my-'' {{IPA|[\u02c8mai\u032f]}} superlative, most, -est (< ''my'' most), e.g. ''mybel'' {{IPA|[mai\u032f\u02d0'b\u025bl]}} \"most beautiful(ly)\"\n\n===Word Formative Suffixes===\n:''-a'' {{IPA|[(j)a\u02d0]}} unfavourable\n:''-b'' {{IPA|[b, \u026ab]}} possibility, -ible, -able (< ''ib'' possible)\n:''-c'' {{IPA|[t\u0283o\u02d0]}} collection (< ''co'' collect, collection)\n:''-e'' {{IPA|[(j)e\u02d0]}} augmentative\n:''-f'' {{IPA|[f]}} causative (after a vowel) (< ''fy'' cause, make, reason, render)\n:''-g'' {{IPA|[\u0261, \u026a\u0261]}} (an idea having a general relationship to the root) (< ''ig'' general)\n:''-i'' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} association (after a consonant), possessive on pronouns\n:''-k'' {{IPA|[k, \u026ak]}} quality, -ic (< ''ik'' property, quality)\n:''-l'' {{IPA|[l, \u026al]}} (an idea having a special relationship to the root) (< ''il'' particular, special, especial)\n:''-m'' {{IPA|[m, \u0254m]}} thing (< ''om'' article, object, thing)\n:''-n'' {{IPA|[(j)\u028an]}} negative, -less, in-, un- (< ''un'' negative)\n:''-o'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} contrary, opposite (after a consonant)\n:''-p'' {{IPA|[p, \u025bp]}} place (< ''ep'' location, place, position, put, set)\n:''-r'' {{IPA|[r, \u0259r, j\u025br]}} person, agent, -er (< ''er'' person)\n:''-s'' {{IPA|[s, \u026as]}} (an idea having a complementary relationship to the root) (< ''is'' complement)\n:''-t'' {{IPA|[t, \u025bt]}} diminutive, -ette (< ''et'' little, small)\n:''-u'' {{IPA|[(j)u\u02d0]}} favorable\n:''-v'' {{IPA|[v]}} association (after a vowel)\n:''-x'' {{IPA|[ks]}} contrary, opposite (after a vowel)\n:''-y'' {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} causative (after a consonant) (< ''fy'' cause, make, reason, render)\n:''-z'' {{IPA|[z, \u0259z]}} plural, -s\n:''-st'' {{IPA|[\u026ast]}} professional, -ist (< ''ist'' professional)\n\nIn \"Dutton World Speedwords\" we are given on page 64, \u00a7328, the 'indefinite preposition' ''iv''.  But it is clear from Dutton's entry that the affixes ''-i'' and ''-v'' are '''not''' derived from this preposition but rather that the preposition is a backformation from the affixes.\n\nDutton says [words in italics were written as italicized speedwords in the original]: \"''The'' prepositions 'at', 'on', 'by', 'under', etc. ''are sometimes'' used to convey ''a somewhat'' loose ''idea of'' association ''without any'' definite ''idea of position, as in'' 'at the most', 'by the way', 'on business', 'under difficulties', etc.  ''When, therefore, any'' preposition ''is not'' literally applicable, ''the'' Speedword '' 'iv' is'' used.  ''This'' Speedword consists ''of the two'' association suffixes '' 'i-' and '-v' and hence'' appropriately conveys ''the idea of'' association ''without'' definite ''sense of place.''\"\n\n===Interfixes (not written)===\n:''-'' {{IPA|[\u014b, \u026a\u014b]}} two-root compound \n:''-'' {{IPA|[\u0283, \u026a\u0283]}} three-root compound\nFor examples see '''Compound words''' in the 'Phonology and orthography' section above.\n\n==Potential improvements to Speedwords==\nThere are three potential improvements to Speedwords which would overcoming ambiguities, remove omissions or deficiencies, and overcome confusion. These were discussed.<ref name=ename6>\"Oliver, Gary R, 2019 Micro-intellectual capital: The case of Dutton Speedwords, International Conference on Intellectual Capital and Knowledge Management, Macquarie University 5 December.\"</ref>\n\nA major ambiguity is terminological. Dutton uses three terms interchangeably in TYDS. They are 'parent word' (page 9, 88), 'radical' (page 88) 'word-root' (page 51, 52), and 'word family' (page 89). He sometimes uses them identically, to mean the stem, that is an indivisible element TYS page 88). At other times he means the indivisible element plus prefix or suffix or the compounds of indivisible elements (TYDS, page 158). By doing so he lacks the ability to distinguish between them. It would be much simpler to reserve the three terms for the indivisible element and then use the term \"extension\" for the addition of prefix or suffix. \"Compound\" would retain its existing usage. Even more confusingly he adds another term 'word familities' (TYDS, page 89). It is not clear whether this refers to the ndivisible element plus all its prefixes and suffixes. Dutton also refers to \"keywords\" meaning the basic or essential stem words to which prefixes and suffixes are added. So, this means there is ambiguity for the learner on what is the basic vocabulary of Speedwords. Some further research is underway to see if this can be clarified.\n\nThere is an obvious omission and deficiency. These could have easily been rectified by Dutton using his personal knowledge and included in an expanded TYDS edition.\n\nThe major omission is a description of his rationale behind formulating the Speedwords he has chosen. In his opening chapter of all editions of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords titled \"Dutton Speedwords Analysed\" (TYDS, pages 7\u20139) he describes some of the principles he used. For example, using Horn's analysis of frequently used words<ref name=ename7>\"Horn, Ernest 1926 A basic writing vocabulary: 10,000 words most commonly used in writing. Iowa City, IO: College of Education, University of Iowa.\"</ref> to determine how much to abbreviate or truncate his Speedword vocabulary, and, drawing on words common to several European languages. But this does not equate to a systematic account of how new technical words and expressions could be added to the Speedword vocabulary. Nor does it show that the existing Speedwords were wisely chosen.\n\nThe major deficiencies arise from overcoming confusion caused by apparent inconsistencies in understanding what is meant by particular Speedwords given the variety of Speedword formation methods available. There are four possible areas of confusion. First, deciphering the meaning of a Speedword can produce several possible candidate meanings. There are 20 suffixes (TYDS, page 90). The practice of incorporating  a Speedword suffix into the Speedword meakes it difficult to decide whether a Speedword is either a Speedword stem (that is, an indivisible element) or a Speedword and a suffix. For example, the Speedword 'de' is day, 'deb' is debt but 'debe' is yesterday. The suffix 'e' is an augmentive (TYDS, page 37) signalling a comparative increase. So, an untutored interpretation would suggest that 'debe' is a large debt. Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Second, contractions of frequently used Speedwords actually multiply the vocabulary by creating new Speedwords. For example, 'debe' yesterday is shortened to 'db', and 'jecen' percent is shortened to 'jc'. Again, Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Third, there are some puzzling inconsistencies. For example, 'La' is great, 'Mla' is greater. 'M' is also used as an abbreviation for 'Mr'. It is unclear whether this is a misprint with the L in lower case and what the 'm' signifies. Finally, Dutton encourages joining Speedwords together as compounds except where they are equivalent to an existing Speedword. This creates new Speedwords which become unrecognisable because they are not in the dictionary, Again, utton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. The disadvantage is it increases the vocabulary reducing the benefit from keeping the vocabulary small.\n\nIn summary, these shortcomings are resolvable. Ambiguity could be resolved by obtaining a copy of the Speedwords publication which lists the 493 elementary Speedwords but this is unobtainable. It may also contain the rationale for formulating Speedwords. The deficiencies should be addressed differently. Instead of immediately changing some Speedwords, the system of affixes (prefix, suffix) need to be re-examined. The number of prefixes should be reduced. Some overlap (e.g., augmentation, and favourable, TYDS, pages 37\u201338, 34 respectively). The complement suffix denote an incorrect pair or is out of sequence TYDS, pages 50\u201351) for example, 'ze' means send but 'zes' is bring. The diminutive suffix does not convey magnitude (TYDS, page 51), for example, 'do' for live, while 'dot' is visit). The use of a prefix conceals the Speedword because the first letter cannot be immediately recognised. These proposals would make Speedwords more easily recognisable because the elementary stem would be reliably recognisable.

During the Bosnian war for independence between 1992\u201395 the town was the only municipality not governed by the [[Party of Democratic Action|SDA party]]-led authorities. After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence and was recognized by the United Nations the city was besieged by Serbian forces. A few days later Serbian forces attacked Tuzla. The town was not spared the atrocities of the [[Bosnian War]]. \n\nThe [[1992 Yugoslav People's Army column incident in Tuzla]] was a conflict between [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the 92nd Motorized Brigade of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) on 15 May 1992. The incident occurred at the road junction of Br\u010danska Malta during JNA's agreed withdrawal from the city when the skirmish between forces loyal to the Bosnian government and the withdrawing JNA occurred. At least 50 members of the JNA were killed and 44 wounded during the attacks.\n\nOn 25 May 1995, an attack on Tuzla killed 71 people and injured 200 persons in what is referred to as the [[Tuzla massacre]], when a shell fired from Serb's positions on the Ozren mountain (130&nbsp;mm towed field gun M-46) hit the central street and its promenade. The youngest civilian who died in that massacre was only two years old.\n\nFollowing the [[Dayton Peace Accords]], Tuzla was the headquarters of the U.S. forces for the Multinational Division (MND) during Operation Joint Endeavour [[IFOR]] and subsequent [[SFOR]].\n\n<!--\n<gallery>\nFile:MemorijalniKompleksSlanaBanja.jpg|Memorial cemetery \"Slana banja\"\nFile:Cntrsq.png|Franjeva\u010dka Street (left)\nFile:President Clinton meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Tuzla, Bosnia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] meeting with Bosnian President [[Alija Izetbegovic]] in Tuzla, December 1997\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n===Post-war independence===\n[[File:Bosnian_social_protests_Tuzla.jpg|thumb|[[Tuzla Canton]] Government Building in flames during the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]\n{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}\nIn February 2014 the city was the scene of the beginning of the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which quickly spread to dozens of cities and towns throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Tuzla_Valley_coal_mines.jpg|thumb|Tuzla valley (coal mines, lakes, airport)]]\n<!-- [[File:Termoelektrana_Tuzla.JPG|thumb|[[Tuzla Power Plant]]]] -->\n<!-- [[File:Sojenice Tuzla - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Archeological park \"Sojenice\"]] -->\nTuzla is located in the northeastern part of Bosnia, settled just underneath the Majevica mountain range, on the Jala River. The central zone lies in an east\u2013west oriented plain, with residential areas in the north and south of the city located on the Ilin\u010dica, Kicelj and Gradina Hills. It is {{convert|237|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].  The climate is moderate [[continental climate|continental]]. There are abundant [[coal]] deposits in the region around Tuzla. 6 [[coal mines]] continue to operate around the city.  Much of the coal mined in the area is used to power the [[Tuzla Power Plant]], which is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n===Salt deposits===\nExtractions of the city's salt deposits, particularly in the 20th century, have caused sections of the city center to sink. Structures in the \"sinking area\" either collapsed or were demolished, and there are few structures in the city that predate the 20th century, despite the fact that the city was founded over 1000 years ago. In the northeastern part of the town is an area known as [[Solina, Tuzla|Solina]], named after the salt deposits.\n\n===Pannonian Lakes===\nTuzla is the only city in Europe that has a [[salt lake]] at its centre. The ancient Pannonian Sea dried up around 10 million years ago, but work by researchers and scientists has now enabled a level of saline water to be kept stable at the surface, and in 2003 the Pannonian Lake was opened.\n\nA second lake that includes [[artificial waterfall]]s was inaugurated in 2008. An archaeological park and replica Neolithic lake dwellings were also incorporated into the scheme, providing information about the different cultures which left their material and spiritual mark here.

During the Bosnian war for independence between 1992\u201395 the town was the only municipality not governed by the [[Party of Democratic Action|SDA party]]-led authorities. After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence and was recognized by the United Nations the city was besieged by Serbian forces. A few days later Serbian forces attacked Tuzla. The town was not spared the atrocities of the [[Bosnian War]]. \n\nThe [[1992 Yugoslav People's Army column incident in Tuzla]] was a conflict between [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the 92nd Motorized Brigade of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) on 15 May 1992. The incident occurred at the road junction of Br\u010danska Malta during JNA\u2019s agreed withdrawal from the city when the skirmish between forces loyal to the Bosnian government and the withdrawing JNA occurred. At least 50 members of the JNA were killed and 44 wounded during the attacks.\n\nOn 25 May 1995, an attack on Tuzla killed 71 people and injured 200 persons in what is referred to as the [[Tuzla massacre]], when a shell fired from Serb's positions on the Ozren mountain (130&nbsp;mm towed field gun M-46) hit the central street and its promenade. The youngest civilian who died in that massacre was only two years old.\n\nFollowing the [[Dayton Peace Accords]], Tuzla was the headquarters of the U.S. forces for the Multinational Division (MND) during Operation Joint Endeavour [[IFOR]] and subsequent [[SFOR]].\n\n<!--\n<gallery>\nFile:MemorijalniKompleksSlanaBanja.jpg|Memorial cemetery \"Slana banja\"\nFile:Cntrsq.png|Franjeva\u010dka Street (left)\nFile:President Clinton meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Tuzla, Bosnia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] meeting with Bosnian President [[Alija Izetbegovic]] in Tuzla, December 1997\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n===Post-war independence===\n[[File:Bosnian_social_protests_Tuzla.jpg|thumb|[[Tuzla Canton]] Government Building in flames during the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]\n{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}\nIn February 2014 the city was the scene of the beginning of the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which quickly spread to dozens of cities and towns throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Tuzla_Valley_coal_mines.jpg|thumb|Tuzla valley (coal mines, lakes, airport)]]\n<!-- [[File:Termoelektrana_Tuzla.JPG|thumb|[[Tuzla Power Plant]]]] -->\n<!-- [[File:Sojenice Tuzla - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Archeological park \"Sojenice\"]] -->\nTuzla is located in the northeastern part of Bosnia, settled just underneath the Majevica mountain range, on the Jala River. The central zone lies in an east-west oriented plain, with residential areas in the north and south of the city located on the Ilin\u010dica, Kicelj and Gradina Hills. It is {{convert|237|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].  The climate is moderate [[continental climate|continental]]. There are abundant [[coal]] deposits in the region around Tuzla. 6 [[coal mines]] continue to operate around the city.  Much of the coal mined in the area is used to power the [[Tuzla Power Plant]], which is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n===Salt deposits===\nExtractions of the city's salt deposits, particularly in the 20th century, have caused sections of the city center to sink. Structures in the \"sinking area\" either collapsed or were demolished, and there are few structures in the city that predate the 20th century, despite the fact that the city was founded over 1000 years ago. In the northeastern part of the town is an area known as [[Solina, Tuzla|Solina]], named after the salt deposits.\n\n===Pannonian Lakes===\nTuzla is the only city in Europe that has a [[salt lake]] at its centre. The ancient Pannonian Sea dried up around 10 million years ago, but work by researchers and scientists has now enabled a level of saline water to be kept stable at the surface, and in 2003 the Pannonian Lake was opened.\n\nA second lake that includes [[artificial waterfall]]s was inaugurated in 2008. An archaeological park and replica Neolithic lake dwellings were also incorporated into the scheme, providing information about the different cultures which left their material and spiritual mark here.

This ensured more than 30,000 hectares of [[Paddy field|Paddy]] crops were saved from lodging and inundation due to the cyclone and Fishermen were alerted one week before [[Landfall]] not to venture into the sea considering a forecast of rough sea and tidal waves. There was not even a single casualty of fishermen during the cyclone. RTGS alerted the fisheries department, local administrations, local communities, village functionaries of the impending storm through IVRS calls advising them to stay off the sea.

After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

The plan is a part of making Vizag an \"International City\" and the state's tourism hub. The proposal to build the international airport is part of his Vision 2020 as per which two new international airports are proposed, Shamshabad International Airport and Visakhapatnam Airport. After returning in 2014 his government acquired 2,703 acres of land, but it required four years due to land owner disputes and acquisition at Bhogapuram, Vizianagaram and Naidu laid the foundation for a new greenfield international airport for Visakhapatnam on February 2019 and said [[Bhogapuram Airport|Bhogapuram International Airport]] would boost the economic development of northern coastal districts and a world-class airport is needed for the promotion of IT and tourism in Vizag. While the airport developed under PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode also will be integrated with Aerocity, a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facility and an Aviation Academy and Naidu assigned bid to GMR group, the same infrastructure company he assigned bid to build and operate the [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport|Shamshabad International Airport]] at Hyderabad. The current Visakhapatnam Airport is a naval airfield belonging to the Eastern Naval Command, which proposed separate flying slots for civil and military flights at city airport.

After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

The plan is a part of making Vizag an \"International City\" and the state's tourism hub. The proposal to build the international airport is part of his Vision 2020 as per which two new international airports are proposed, Shamshabad International Airport and Visakhapatnam Airport. After returning in 2014 his government acquired 2,703 acres of land, but it required four years due to land owner disputes and acquisition at Bhogapuram, Vizianagaram and Naidu laid the foundation for a new greenfield international airport for Visakhapatnam on February 2019 and said [[Bhogapuram Airport|Bhogapuram International Airport]] would boost the economic development of northern coastal districts and a world-class airport is needed for the promotion of IT and tourism in Vizag. While the airport developed under PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode also will be integrated with Aerocity, a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facility and an Aviation Academy and Naidu assigned bid to GMR group, the same infrastructure company he assigned bid to build and operate the [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport|Shamshabad International Airport]] at Hyderabad. The current Visakhapatnam Airport is a naval airfield belonging to the Eastern Naval Command, which proposed separate flying slots for civil and military flights at city airport.
