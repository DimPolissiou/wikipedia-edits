However, ''[[ex nihilo]]'' creation, a belief also commonly found among Arminians, means that God determined everything that exists, including the will of each soul, without drawing on anything but himself. The question is definitively resolved in [[Calvinism]] by asserting that all souls act according to God's sovereign will, and in [[Mormonism]] (see below) by asserting that human souls have always existed and are co-eternal with God.<ref>{{cite conference\n|last=Hausam\n|first=Mark\n|year=2005\n|title=It's All in Arminius: Mormonism as a Form of Hyper-Arminianism\n|url=http://lehislibrary.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/mark-hausam-calvinism-arminianism-mormonism.pdf#page=20\n|conference=[[Sunstone Symposium]]\n|location=[[Salt Lake City]]\n|pages=20&ndash;21\n|quote=What has not been frequently observed, however, is that the concept of free agency allows Arminian thought to do an end-run around the concept of our creation ''ex nihilo'' and brings in by the back door a concept of human beings as uncreated entities.

By inference, those born into life instead chose God as a pre-requisite to being born.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:8-9\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.8-9?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:8-9\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> This appears to be the justification for Jacob\u2019s teaching that God\u2019s atonement would redeem all those who died without knowledge of the law.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:25-26\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.25-26?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:25-26\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> Jacob and later writers in the [[Book of Mormon]] express the teaching that Christ\u2019s sacrifice was intended to allow all mankind the possibility of return to that God who had given them life, presumably pre-mortal spiritual life.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:38\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.38?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:38\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Alma 40:11\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.11?lang=eng\n|volume=Alma 40:11\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> In 1833, early in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], its founder [[Joseph Smith]] taught that human souls are co-eternal with [[God the Father]] just as [[Jesus]] is co-eternal with God the Father, \"Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Doctrine and Covenants\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng\n|volume=93:29\n|date=6 May 1833\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1844, Smith elaborated on this idea in his [[King Follett discourse]]:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=History of the Church\n|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-14\n|volume=6:14\n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n...the soul&mdash;the mind of man&mdash;the immortal spirit. Where did it come from? All learned men and doctors of divinity say that God created it in the beginning; but it is not so: the very idea lessens man in my estimation...We say that God Himself is a self-existing being...Man does exist upon the same principles...[The Bible] does not say in the Hebrew that God created the spirit of man. It says, \"God made man out of the earth and put into him Adam's spirit, and so became a living body.\" The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal with God himself...Is it logical to say that the intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it has a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal with our Father in heaven.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the context of this core doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the term ''premortal existence'' is a significantly more accurate term to describe the time before this mortal existence than ''pre-existence'', since pre-existence has a connotation of something existing before the beginning of existence, and Latter Day Saint doctrine specifically rejects ''[[ex-nihilo]]'' creation. Therefore, the term ''premortal existence'' is strongly preferred in the movement's largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), to represent the time before this mortal life, however the term ''pre-existence'' is in widespread use.\n\n====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints====\nAfter Smith's death, the doctrine of premortal existence was elaborated by some other leaders within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Although the mind and intelligence of humanity were still considered to be co-eternal with God, and not created, [[Brigham Young]] taught that the spirit was different from the mind or intelligence, resolving the seeming conflict between [[Book of Mormon]] verses indicating God was creator and Smith\u2019s later teaching that all individuals were co-eternal with [[God]]. Young postulated that we each had a pre-spirit intelligence that later became part of a spirit body, which then eventually entered a physical body and was born on earth. In 1857, Young stated that every person was \"a son or a daughter of [the Father]. In the spirit world their spirits were first begotten and brought forth, and they lived there with their parents for ages before they came here.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Young\n|first=Brigham\n|authorlink=Brigham Young\n|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/541\n|title=To Know God is Eternal Life&mdash;God is the Father of our Spirits and Bodies&mdash;Things Created Spiritually First&mdash;Atonement by the Shedding of Blood\n|journal=[[Journal of Discourses]]\n|volume=4\n|page=218\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Ostler\n|first=Blake\n|authorlink=Blake Ostler\n|year=1982\n|title=The idea of pre-existence in the development of Mormon thought\n|url=https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V15N01_61.pdf\n|journal=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]\n|volume=15\n|issue=1\n|pages=59\u201378\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the idea of spirit birth was described in its modern doctrinal form in 1909, when the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued the following statement:<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Smith, Joseph F.\n|authorlink=Joseph F.

However, there are differences of opinion as to the nature of the  premortal existence in other Latter Day Saint denominations.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints teaches that during the premortal existence, there was a learning process which eventually led to the next necessary step in the premortal spirits' opportunity to progress. This next step included the need to gain a physical [[Human body|body]] that could experience [[pain]], sorrow and joy and \"walk by faith.\" According to this belief, these purposes were explained and discussed in [[Divine Council#Hebrew|councils in heaven]], followed by the [[War in Heaven]] where Satan rebelled against the plan of Heavenly Father.\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn the [[Bhagavad Gita]], considered by Hindus to be a most holy scripture, [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]; \"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is\n|url=http://vedabase.net/bg/2/12/en\n|chapter=Chapter 2 Verse 12}}</ref>\n\n==Islam==\nIn Islam, all souls are believed to have been created in adult form (before earthly life) at the same time God created the father of mankind, Adam.

Humans do not remember, as they are born with an undeveloped mind (leaving only an innate awareness that God exists and is one, known as the ''[[Fitra]]'') and he decreed at which point each and every human would be born into the physical world.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afterlife]]\n* [[Bodhisattva]]\n* [[Gnosticism]]\n* ''[[Hypostasis of the Archons]]''\n* [[Kabbalah]]\n* [[Origen#Views|Origenism]]\n* [[Manichaeism]]\n* [[Near-birth experience]]\n* [[Spiritualism]]\n* [[Scientology]]\n* [[Western esotericism#Philosophy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Pre-existence, Doctrine of}}\n* [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/m/metempsychosis.html Metempsychosis: From the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'']\u2014''see'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10234d.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Metempsychosis].\n* [http://www.iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/ Origen of Alexandria (185-254 CE), ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].\n* [http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/reincar/re-imo.htm \"Reincarnation as Taught by Early Christians\"], by I.

The question is definitively resolved in [[Calvinism]] by asserting that all souls act according to God's sovereign will, and in [[Mormonism]] (see below) by asserting that human souls have always existed and are co-eternal with God.<ref>{{cite conference\n|last=Hausam\n|first=Mark\n|year=2005\n|title=It's All in Arminius: Mormonism as a Form of Hyper-Arminianism\n|url=http://lehislibrary.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/mark-hausam-calvinism-arminianism-mormonism.pdf#page=20\n|conference=[[Sunstone Symposium]]\n|location=[[Salt Lake City]]\n|pages=20&ndash;21\n|quote=What has not been frequently observed, however, is that the concept of free agency allows Arminian thought to do an end-run around the concept of our creation ''ex nihilo'' and brings in by the back door a concept of human beings as uncreated entities. Creation ''ex nihilo'' implies a radical metaphysical dependence upon God, one that logically guarantees that the creature will not be independent from God or be capable of independent contributions to reality in the ways envisioned in Arminian thought. In fact, creation ''ex nihilo'' logically leads directly to Calvinistic determinism.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Latter Day Saints===\n{{see also|Mormon cosmology#Pre-mortality|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)#Pre-mortal existence}}\nThe concept of premortal existence is an early and fundamental doctrine of [[Mormonism]].

By inference, those born into life instead chose God as a pre-requisite to being born.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:8-9\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.8-9?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:8-9\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> This appears to be the justification for Jacob\u2019s teaching that God\u2019s atonement would redeem all those who died without knowledge of the law.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:25-26\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.25-26?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:25-26\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> Jacob and later writers in the [[Book of Mormon]] express the teaching that Christ\u2019s sacrifice was intended to allow all mankind the possibility of return to that God who had given them life, presumably pre-mortal spiritual life.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Jacob 9:38\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.38?lang=eng\n|volume=Jacob 9:38\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book\n|title=Book of Mormon, Alma 40:11\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.11?lang=eng\n|volume=Alma 40:11\n|date=26 March 1830\n}}</ref> In 1833, early in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], its founder [[Joseph Smith]] taught that human souls are co-eternal with [[God the Father]] just as [[Jesus]] is co-eternal with God the Father, \"Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Doctrine and Covenants\n|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng\n|volume=93:29\n|date=6 May 1833\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1844, Smith elaborated on this idea in his [[King Follett discourse]]:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=History of the Church\n|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-14\n|volume=6:14\n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n...the soul&mdash;the mind of man&mdash;the immortal spirit. Where did it come from? All learned men and doctors of divinity say that God created it in the beginning; but it is not so: the very idea lessens man in my estimation...We say that God Himself is a self-existing being...Man does exist upon the same principles...[The Bible] does not say in the Hebrew that God created the spirit of man. It says, \"God made man out of the earth and put into him Adam's spirit, and so became a living body.\" The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal with God himself...Is it logical to say that the intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it has a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal with our Father in heaven.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the context of this core Latter Day Saint doctrine, the term ''premortal existence'' is a significantly more accurate term to describe the time before this mortal existence than ''pre-existence'', since pre-existence has a connotation of something existing before the beginning of existence, and Latter Day Saint doctrine specifically rejects ''[[ex-nihilo]]'' creation. Therefore, the term ''premortal existence'' is strongly preferred in the movement's largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), to represent the time before this mortal life, however the term ''pre-existence'' is in widespread use.\n\n====LDS Church====\nAfter Smith's death, the doctrine of premortal existence was elaborated by some other leaders within the LDS Church. Although the mind and intelligence of humanity were still considered to be co-eternal with God, and not created, [[Brigham Young]] taught that the spirit was different from the mind or intelligence, resolving the seeming conflict between [[Book of Mormon]] verses indicating God was creator and Smith\u2019s later teaching that all individuals were co-eternal with [[God]]. Young postulated that we each had a pre-spirit intelligence that later became part of a spirit body, which then eventually entered a physical body and was born on earth. In 1857, Young stated that every person was \"a son or a daughter of [the Father]. In the spirit world their spirits were first begotten and brought forth, and they lived there with their parents for ages before they came here.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Young\n|first=Brigham\n|authorlink=Brigham Young\n|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/541\n|title=To Know God is Eternal Life&mdash;God is the Father of our Spirits and Bodies&mdash;Things Created Spiritually First&mdash;Atonement by the Shedding of Blood\n|journal=[[Journal of Discourses]]\n|volume=4\n|page=218\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Ostler\n|first=Blake\n|authorlink=Blake Ostler\n|year=1982\n|title=The idea of pre-existence in the development of Mormon thought\n|url=https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V15N01_61.pdf\n|journal=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]\n|volume=15\n|issue=1\n|pages=59\u201378\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the LDS Church the idea of spirit birth was described in its modern doctrinal form in 1909, when the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued the following statement:<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Smith, Joseph F.\n|authorlink=Joseph F.

However, there are differences of opinion as to the nature of the  premortal existence in other Latter Day Saint denominations.\n\nThe LDS Church teaches that during the premortal existence, there was a learning process which eventually led to the next necessary step in the premortal spirits' opportunity to progress. This next step included the need to gain a physical [[Human body|body]] that could experience [[pain]], sorrow and joy and \"walk by faith.\" According to this belief, these purposes were explained and discussed in [[Divine Council#Hebrew|councils in heaven]], followed by the [[War in Heaven]] where Satan rebelled against the plan of Heavenly Father.\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn the [[Bhagavad Gita]], considered by Hindus to be a most holy scripture, [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]; \"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is\n|url=http://vedabase.net/bg/2/12/en\n|chapter=Chapter 2 Verse 12}}</ref>\n\n==Islam==\nIn Islam, all souls are believed to have been created in adult form (before earthly life) at the same time God created the father of mankind, Adam.

Humans do not remember, as they are born with an undeveloped mind (leaving only an innate awareness that God exists and is one, known as the ''[[Fitra]]'') and he decreed at which point each and every human would be born into the physical world.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afterlife]]\n* [[Bodhisattva]]\n* [[Gnosticism]]\n* ''[[Hypostasis of the Archons]]''\n* [[Kabbalah]]\n* [[Origen#Views|Origenism]]\n* [[Manichaeism]]\n* [[Near-birth experience]]\n* [[Spiritualism]]\n* [[Scientology]]\n* [[Western esotericism#Philosophy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Pre-existence, Doctrine of}}\n* [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/m/metempsychosis.html Metempsychosis: From the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'']\u2014''see'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10234d.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Metempsychosis].\n* [http://www.iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/ Origen of Alexandria (185-254 CE), ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].\n* [http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/reincar/re-imo.htm \"Reincarnation as Taught by Early Christians\"], by I.

It serves grades 9 to 12, and falls under District 20 of the [[New York City Department of Education]].\n\n== History ==\nNineteen Dutch settlers founded the town of [[New Utrecht]] on January 16, 1657, named after the city of [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], from which their leader came.\n\nIt was from this early colony that New Utrecht High School received its name. The school was established in 1915 as an offshoot of [[Bay Ridge High School]], which up to that time had been [[coeducational]]. With the creation of New Utrecht High School, Bay Ridge became a school for girls only, while New Utrecht was an all-boys school.\n\nThe first home of the school, which had a population of 350 boys, was a wooden building on 86th Street near 18th Avenue. Irving Hazen was its first principal, and the school colors, green and white, were selected as a compliment to Hazen's alma mater, [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nAlthough the first graduating class had only sixteen boys, the growth in student population was rapid. In November 1924, the present building on 80th Street and 16th Avenue was opened, with a student body of about 2,300 and in February of the next year girls were admitted for the first time. Since then, three girls have been elected to the presidency of the student government. In the next few years, the school continued to grow, until it consisted of a main building and four annexes, comprising a total of nearly 11,000 boys and girls. This was the largest student body in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bklyner.com/save-the-date-new-utrecht-high-school-celebrates-100-years-on-october-24-bensonhurst/|title=Save The Date: New Utrecht High School Celebrates 100 Years On October 24|last=Silberstein|first=Rachel|date=2015-09-29|website=BKLYNER|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Student Government===\nNew Utrecht has an active student government, which is elected every October. For close to a century the student government positions were mayor, deputy mayor, secretary, treasurer, and student representatives from each grade. The mayoral theme was a longstanding tradition that stemmed from the fact that [[New Utrecht, Brooklyn|New Utrecht]] (the neighborhood) was named by Dutch settlers after the city of [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]. In 2015, the student government decided to change the name of the two major positions of mayor and deputy mayor to student body president and student body vice president. The New Utrecht High School Student Government is responsible for allocating funds to clubs, as well as organizing a School Spirit Week, a Thanksgiving Dinner, a Toy Drive, and other annual school-wide events.\n\nThere is also a Senior Council composed of a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The Senior Council is responsible for organizing Senior events, such as the Senior Class Brunch and Senior Trip, creating the Senior Class sweatshirts, voicing concerns of the Senior Class to the administration, and keeping the Senior Class informed.\n\n===School Leadership Team===\nThe School Leadership Team (SLT) consists of representatives from the school administration, parents, teachers and students. The students are usually two active students, one junior and one senior, who voice the concerns of the student body. The SLT meets monthly to discuss and work on issues related to implementation of the school's mission and vision. A [[Parent-Teacher Association|P.T.A.]] meeting follows immediately after.\n\n===Productions at New Utrecht High School===\nThere are four productions held annually at New Utrecht: the Talent Show, the Chinese New Year Show, the Fashion Show, and the International Show.\n\nThe Talent Show is open to anyone who has talent, whether it be singing, dancing, magic, comedy or any other form of entertainment. The sound crew, lighting crew, stage crew, construction crew and booklet crew are composed entirely of students. The show is usually held in December.\n\nThe Chinese New Year Show is put on near the [[Chinese New Year]]. It has singing, dancing, acting and other forms of entertainment, revolving around Chinese culture. The Chinese Club at New Utrecht has a partnership with a non-profit organization called the [[Chinese-American Planning Council]].\n\nThe Fashion Show production at New Utrecht High School is student run and consists of students in the New Utrecht Fashion Society creating their own clothes and having their friends model them. The show is usually held in March or April.\n\nThe International Show is held in April or May and, like the others, is completely student run. It is similar to the Talent Show but focuses on other countries around the world.\n\n===Clubs===\nNew Utrecht offers clubs for students, including:\n{{Div col}}\n* Student Organization\n* Arista Society\n* Art Club\n* Asian Club\n* Chinese Chess/Gaming Club\n* Chinese Debate Club\n* Chess & Game Club\n* Creative Problem Solving Club\n* Dance Club\n* Disc Jockey (DJ) Club\n* Glee Club\n* History Club\n* LGBTQ+ Student Association\n* Photography Club\n* Robotics Club\n* Sound Club (Audio/Visual)\n* Stock/Investigating Club\n {{Div col end}}\n\n==Advanced Placement==\nNew Utrecht offers [[Advanced Placement]] courses, including:\n{{Div col}} \n* AP Calculus AB\n* AP Calculus BC\n* AP World History/Human Geography \n* AP United States History \n* AP United States Government and Politics\n* AP Comparative Government and Politics\n* AP Micro-Economics\n* AP Macro-Economics\n* AP English Language and Composition\n* AP English Literature and Composition\n* AP Chemistry\n* AP Physics\n* AP Biology\n* AP Psychology\n* AP Computer Science A\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Academies==\nThere are several academies (programs that offer employment-oriented training in specialized fields) at New Utrecht, which include:\n{{Div col}} \n* Academy of Business of Technology\n* Academy of Medical Professions and Health Careers\n* Academy of Legal Studies\n* Academy of Hospitality and Tourism\n* Academy of Art and Design\n* Honors Academy\n {{Div col end}}\nSome academies are associated with [[NAF (non-profit organization)|NAF]], a non-profit organization originally known as the National Academy Foundation.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{alumni|date=May 2017}}\nNotable alumni include:\n\n*[[Walter Adams (economist)|Walter Adams]] (1922\u20131998): economist and university president\n*[[Koby Altman]] (born 1982): professional basketball general manager\n*[[Carmine Appice]] (born 1946): musician, drummer\n*[[Steve Augeri]] (born 1959): singer\n*[[Troy Ave]] (born 1985): rapper\n*[[Lord Have Mercy (musician)| Lord Have Mercy]] (born 1973): Rapper \n*[[Gene Barry]] (born Eugene Klass; 1919\u20132009): actor\n*[[Seymour Benzer]] (1921-2007): biologist\n*[[Barbara Aronstein Black]] (born 1933): Dean of [[Columbia Law School]]\n*[[Abe Burrows]] (1910\u20131985): playwright\n*[[Pat Capri]] (1918\u20131989): professional baseball player<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/hs/hs_alumni.asp?H=6455|title=New Utrecht (Brooklyn, NY) Baseball|publisher=The Baseball Cube|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]]: comedian\n*[[Ronald Castorina]]: New York State Assembly Member\n*[[Phyllis Chesler]]: feminist author, psychologist\n*[[Joseph Colombo]] (1923\u20131978): head of the [[Colombo crime family]]\n*[[Fangoria Magazine|Tom DeFeo]]: president of ''Fangoria Magazine'' and Starlog Group\n*[[Max Desfor]] (1913\u20132018): photographer \n*[[Amram Ducovny]] (1927\u2013 2003): non-fiction, play and novel writer\n*[[Stanley Ellin]]: author\n*[[Jerry Ferrara]]: actor\n*[[Cy Feuer]]: playwright, stage director and producer\n*[[Stanley Fink]] (1936\u20131997): Speaker of the New York State Assembly\n*[[Eli Friedman]] (born 1933): [[nephrologist]]\n*[[Leo Friedman]]: Broadway photographer\n*[[Allen Funt]] (1914\u20131999): creator and host of Candid Camera\n*[[David Geffen]] (born 1943): media mogul\n*[[Ralph Ginzburg]] (1929\u20132006): author, editor, publisher and photo-journalist\n*[[Bernice Gottlieb]] (n\u00e9e Bernice Friedman) (born 1931): pioneer in transracial adoption movement; real estate executive\n*[[Saverio Guerra]]: actor and producer\n*[[Philip Habib]] (1920\u20131992): US diplomat\n*[[Buddy Hackett]] (born Leonard Hacker; 1924\u20132003): comedian\n*[[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]]: writer\n*[[Sal Iacono]]: television comedian\n*[[David Ignatow]]: poet, author\n*[[Gabe Kaplan]] (born 1945): comic, actor, poker player\n*[[Michael Kidd]] (1915\u20132007): choreographer\n*[[Harvey Lembeck]] (1923\u20131982): actor\n*[[Steve Lombardi]]: professional wrestler\n*[[Paulie Malignaggi]]: professional boxer\n* [[Harold Martin (New Jersey politician)|Harold Martin]] (1918-2010): politician<ref>Levin, Jay.

It was released in October 1968 by [[Capitol Records]].\n\nAxelrod sought to capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music and composed the album as a [[suite (music)|suite]]-like [[tone poem]] interpreting ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience|Songs of Innocence]]'', a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by [[William Blake]]. He recorded the album at [[Capitol Studios]] in Los Angeles with an orchestra and studio musicians from [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] collective, including keyboardist and conductor [[Don Randi]], guitarist [[Al Casey (rock & roll guitarist)|Al Casey]], bassist [[Carol Kaye]], and drummer [[Earl Palmer]].\n\n''Song of Innocence'' is an instrumental [[jazz fusion]] record that incorporates elements of [[classical music|classical]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[theatre music]]. It is [[arrangement|arranged]] for bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock [[instrumental idiom|idiom]] with [[tempo]]s centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used [[contrast (music)|contrast]] in his orchestral compositions, interspersing their euphoric [[psychedelic soul|psychedelic R&B]] structures with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke the poet's themes of innocence and spirituality.\n\nThe album was innovative for its application of rock and jazz techniques, but it was not commercially successful and confounded contemporary critics, who viewed it as an ambitious but foolish curiosity piece. In the 1990s, critics reassessed ''Song of Innocence'' as a classic, while leading disc jockeys in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronica]] rediscovered and [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the album's music. \"Holy Thursday\", the record's best-known song, was frequently sampled by hip hop producers. The renewed interest in Axelrod's work prompted [[Stateside Records]] to reissue ''Song of Innocence'' in 2000.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Blake Innocence Title.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Title plate for [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience|Songs of Innocence]]'']]\n\nIn the 1960s, Axelrod worked as a producer and [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive for [[Capitol Records]] in Los Angeles.

of Innocence''''' is the debut [[album]] by American composer and producer [[David Axelrod (musician)|David Axelrod]]. It was released in October 1968 by [[Capitol Records]].\n\nAxelrod sought to capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music and composed the album as a [[suite (music)|suite]]-like [[tone poem]] interpreting ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience|Songs of Innocence]]'', a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by [[William Blake]]. He recorded the album at [[Capitol Studios]] in Los Angeles with an orchestra and studio musicians from [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] collective, including keyboardist and conductor [[Don Randi]], guitarist [[Al Casey (rock & roll guitarist)|Al Casey]], bassist [[Carol Kaye]], and drummer [[Earl Palmer]].\n\n''Song of Innocence'' is an instrumental [[jazz fusion]] record that incorporates elements of [[classical music|classical]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[theatre music]]. It is [[arrangement|arranged]] for bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock [[instrumental idiom|idiom]] with [[tempo]]s centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used [[contrast (music)|contrast]] in his orchestral compositions, interspersing their euphoric [[psychedelic soul|psychedelic R&B]] structures with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke the poet's themes of innocence and spirituality.\n\nThe album was innovative for its application of rock and jazz techniques, but it was not commercially successful and confounded contemporary critics, who viewed it as an ambitious but foolish curiosity piece.
