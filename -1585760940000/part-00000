He has released 7 albums and 23 [[Single (music)|singles]]. He is currently signed to [[One Little Indian Records]], who released his most recent studio album, ''Love Is All Or Love Is Not At All'' on 6 November 2015. The label also released remastered and expanded editions of his first 4 albums in February 2014.<ref>[http://www.indian.co.uk/site/news/marc-carroll-album-reissues-out-today One Little Indian \u2013 Marc Carroll Remasters]</ref> He has received considerable critical acclaim for his recorded output but has never reached any significant level of mainstream success. ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper have called him  \"One of Ireland's great lost songwriters, touched by genius and whose dealings with the music industry have become the stuff of legend\",<ref>Clayton-Lea,Tony. ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin) 28 February 2014 [http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/marc-carroll-ten-of-swords-world-on-a-wire-1.1706909 \"Marc Carroll -World On A Wire & Ten Of Swords\"]</ref> and British rock critic Fred Deller wrote in [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo Magazine'']] that his work was \"deserving of a far wider audience.\"<ref>Deller, Fred. \"Dust of Rumour Review\" ''Mojo Magazine'' (London) 2009</ref>\n\n==Early years/influences==\nCarroll was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland in 1972. Aged 15 he moved to London. He played in several [[Punk rock|punk]] bands during this time. A 7\" single was recorded in 1989 at a studio in [[Islington]], London. 250 copies were pressed of this record but most were subsequently destroyed. A [[test pressing]] of the record is the only known copy to exist. In an interview with [[Uncut (magazine)|''Uncut magazine'']] he said \"The [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Buddy Holly]] were the two things that changed my life.\"<ref>Hughes,Rob. \"Almost Famous\" Page 24 ''Uncut Magazine'' (London) 2005</ref> Carroll has cited [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Brian Wilson]] among his inspirations. In an article for the US magazine, ''American Songwriter'' in 2013, Carroll spoke about the diversity of his influences, \"All through my life I have been drawn to melodies and so often these melodies were delivering urgent, savvy messages and stories. Frequently these tales and stories came from so-called outsiders.  The voices that sang these songs were distinct and unique. They filled your heart and refreshed your soul. From [[Chuck Berry]] to [[Chuck D]]. Anything was possible. From the Sex Pistols to [[Captain Beefheart]]. There are no rules. From [[Crass (band)|Crass]] to Bob Dylan. There is no authority but yourself.\"<ref>Schlansky,Evan. 5 May 2013 ''American Songwriter'' [http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/05/songwriter-u-marc-carroll-a-sense-of-discovery/ \"A Sense Of Discovery\"]</ref>\n\n=== Rough Trade ===\nReturning to Dublin in 1990, Carroll was the sole songwriter and founding member of Dublin three piece power/punk band, Puppy Love Bomb. The group gained notoriety for ferocious live shows but are perhaps best remembered for the [[:wikt:provocative|provocative]] T-shirt with the slogan \"Dublin Is Dead\" which were sold at early performances.  The band recorded several radio sessions for the [[Dave Fanning]]<ref>Puppy Love Bomb 1993 Session 29 August 2013 [http://fanningsessions.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/puppy-love-bomb-1993-session/ \"Fanning Sessions Archive\"]</ref> show and were courted by record labels, notably [[Warner Brothers Music|Warner Brothers]], before eventually signing with the UK independent label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] and releasing 3 [[Single (music)|singles]]. Two [[Extended play|EPs]] were produced by [[Martin Carr]] of [[The Boo Radleys]]. The band toured across Europe with [[Bob Mould]]'s post [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] outfit, [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]]. Mould joined the band on the last night of the tour to play a version of [[The Beatles]] classic song, [[Ticket to Ride (song)|''Ticket To Ride'']].<ref>''Hot Press Magazine'' 16 November 1994 [http://fanningsessions.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/puppy-love-bomb-1993-session/ \"Interview Quote\"]</ref> No album ever materialised as the label fell into financial difficulties and the band split acrimoniously after a final show at the [[South by Southwest]] Festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Carroll returned to London where Rough Trade took over his management. The group's official recorded output has been out of print since 1994. Although the band only released 10 songs commercially, outtakes, radio sessions, demos and unreleased material have surfaced on several bootleg CDs originating from Japan with the most popular title being \"Destroy All Melody\" which features live performances from 1992 and a recording of \"Ticket To Ride\" performed with Bob Mould.  Puppy Love Bomb's recorded output and copyright is now under the ownership of One Little Indian Records. \n....\n\n===1996\u20131999===\nThe Hormones were a rock band formed in London in 1996. Carroll was the sole songwriter for the group, whose sound was described as a mixture between [[Teenage Fanclub]] and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref>Irish Music DB July 1998 [http://irishmusicdb.com/h/hormones/frame.htm \"Singles Review\"]</ref> Carroll was the founding member and songwriter for the band who released their debut single in 1996 as part of the Trade2/Island records singles club. The band members were Jez Housden on Bass and former [[Guns n' Wankers]] and [[The Wildhearts|Wildhearts]] drummer, Pat Walters. The group eventually signed to [[Richard Branson]]'s [[V2 Records|V2]] label and released 5 singles. The third single \"Mr. Wilson\" was Carroll's tribute to [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], the lyrics almost entirely consisting of Beach Boys song titles. Brian Wilson heard the track and Carroll was invited to the legendary songwriter's birthday show at New York City's Beacon Theatre in 1999. An album, ''Where Old Ghosts Meet'' (a reference from ''[[On Raglan Road]]'' by [[Patrick Kavanagh]]) was released in 1998 but deleted the same week. It has been listed in a book ''101 Irish Records You Need to Hear Before You Die''.<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. ''101 Irish Records (You Need To Hear Before You Die)''  Page 106, Liberties Press 2011</ref> The band featured in the wedding episode of US TV show ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''. A track written by Carroll and originally issued as a B-side, \"Tired Old Souls\", was featured in the program. The band toured consistently throughout the UK and Europe. Carroll also performed with the Scottish Poet/Songwriter [[Eric Bogle]] at the Weavers Club in London in 1996.  The band opened for The Cranberries on a European tour in 1999. A 2CD edition of the album was issued in Japan on the Excellent label in 2002 in a limited run of 1000 copies. The bonus disc featured B-sides and unreleased material. A second pressing of the vinyl edition was issued on the Velvet label in Japan in a pressing of 500 copies. The band split in 1999 after a show in [[Madrid]], Spain and the recorded output remains out of print. A multi disc (6CD) bootleg set , \"On A Quiet Street \u2013 The Complete Where Old Ghosts Meet Sessions\" was released on the Last Waltz label in Japan in 2003. It included demos, outtakes, alternate mixes, radio sessions and unreleased material. Carroll has never performed any of these songs live since 1999. The Hormones released 5 singles from the ''Where Old Ghosts Meet'' album, with each single featuring 3 exclusive non album B-sides which added up to 15 extra songs that were not included on the original album.\n\n===Solo period (1999\u2013present)===\n\n====Universal Music/Evangeline Recorded Works/High Noon Recordings====\nCarroll signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] in 1999 and recorded his first solo album, ''Ten of Swords'' later that year. 3 singles were released in Ireland only. Carroll played all of the instruments himself as well as taking on co-production duties with longtime recording partner, Adi Winman.<ref>Adi Winman [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/adi-winman-mn0000928217 \"AllMusic\"] 2014</ref> Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] Guitarist, [[Craig Gannon]] played on several tracks. Gannon also toured the album with Carroll across the UK and Japan in 2002. The album featured Andrew Stidman, drummer of UK rock band, [[The Wildhearts]] on one song. The album was hampered by further record company problems. The UK label refused to release the record. In an interview with ''The Irish Times'' in 2005 Carroll said, \"Sometimes record companies will sign you up so no-one else can, and that happened to me. I was left dangling at Universal for two years of my life so I had no hesitation in saying goodbye. I live and breathe Music. I don't know anything else.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea,Tony. 31 March 2005 Interview. ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> The Irish division of Universal pressed the album and sent it to media but it was withdrawn a week before its scheduled release date. Legendary UK A&R figure, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]] eventually released the album on his Evangeline label in 2002 and the record was met with critical acclaim with UK music magazine ''Uncut'' awarding it a 4 star review and calling it \"One of the finest debuts of recent times.\"<ref>Hughes, Rob. 2003 Reviews ''Uncut Magazine'' (London) [http://www.uncut.co.uk/marc-carroll/marc-carroll-all-wrongs-reversed-review \"All Wrongs Reversed\"]</ref>\n\nThe album received mainly positive critical feedback.

February 2003 ''The Irish Independent'' (Dublin)</ref>  ''The Irish Times'' in an interview with Carroll in 2005 wrote that \"those who skipped over 'Row The Boat Ashore'  on ''Ten of Swords'' and worried about the inclusion of 'On Raglan Road' on ''All Wrongs Reversed'' were missing the point and the music.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. 31 March 2005 Interview ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> The cover of the album is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the infamous [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] label, '[[Trade Mark of Quality]]'. The album title came from a Bob Dylan 10 LP Bootleg set of the same name. The Japanese edition of the album included two bonus tracks and was issued in a red sleeve. It was reissued again with different packaging by High Noon Recordings in 2006. In 2014 One Little Indian released a [[remastered]] and expanded edition of  ''Ten of Swords'' as part of a comprehensive overhaul of Carroll's back catalogue.<ref>One Little Indian, 20 January 2014 [http://www.indian.co.uk/site/news/marc-carroll-album-reissues-out-today \"Marc Carroll Reissues\"]</ref>\n\nEvangeline released ''All Wrongs Reversed'', a compilation of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities in 2003. The original album contained 11 songs including a cover of Bob Dylan's \"[[Gates of Eden (song)|Gates of Eden]]\". Later that year the song appeared as a download on the official Bob Dylan webpage. The album also included another Dylan song, \"[[Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power)|Senor, Tales of Yankee Power]]\". Marc Carroll has also recorded Dylan's \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" as a B-side on the UK single \"Crashpad Number\" and \"[[Tombstone Blues]]\" for ''Uncut'' Magazine's ''Highway 61 Revisited...Revisted'' tribute CD.  Rock critic and author, [[Johnny Rogan]] reviewed the album for ''Mojo'' saying \"A classy compendium of lost songs and rarities, as ever, his pop sensibility is positively tangible, permeating almost every track.\"<ref>Rogan, Johnny. July 2003 Reviews Page 100, ''Mojo Magazine'' (London)</ref> The Album was reissued again in different packaging by High Noon in 2006. In 2014 One Little Indian released a remastered and completely revised edition of the album that duplicated only 5 songs from the original while adding 10 previously unreleased tracks, including \"2541\", \"The Main\" and \"Now That You Know Me\", all of which were written by former Husker Du drummer and songwriter, [[Grant Hart]].  Carroll's first show as a solo artist was with Hart in 1995.  ''All Wrongs Reversed'' also featured a cover version of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song, \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\". The track was originally released in the US only on ''Five Way Street \u2013 A Tribute To Buffalo Springfield''.\n\nIn 2005 Evangeline released the second album, ''World on a Wire''. The sound of the album was vastly different with the bulk of the songs being written on the piano and with string arrangements. ''Uncut magazine'' awarded the album a 4 star review writing, \"For the follow up to the mighty 'Ten of Swords' Carroll has dampened the psych pop fizz for a slower dazzle and it's the more layered arrangements that set these wonderful songs of personal faith aglow.\"<ref>Hughes, Rob. January 2005 ''Uncut Magazine'' (London)</ref> ''Mojo magazine'' in their review wrote, \"He draws out some fetching melodies, none better than ''No Time at All'' which encapsulates his striking ability to make coherent music about inner confusion.\"<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil. January 2005 ''Mojo Magazine'' (London)</ref>  ''The Irish Times'' with another 4 star review said, \"The truth is the guy is something of a genius; On ''World on a Wire'' he has opted for strings of a more mellow nature and created a record of warmth, truth, beauty and something approximating a career best. If Bob Dylan raised on an aural diet of Brian Wilson rather than [[Woody Guthrie]] appeals to you, then prepare to be blown away.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. 4 February 2005 ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> Ireland's ''Hot Press magazine'' noted \"fans of [[Leonard Cohen|Cohen]], [[Jeff Buckley|Buckley]], [[Nick Cave|Cave]] and [[Johnny Cash|Cash]] should find plenty of resonance on this brave artistic statement.\"<ref>O'Hare, Colm. February 2005 Reviews ''Hot Press Magazine'' (Dublin)</ref>  ''Maverick Magazine'' in their review picked up on Carroll's lyric writing, \"There is a darkness and quite startling intensity to his lyrics that can make the listener feel decidedly uncomfortable.\"<ref>Issue 31 February 2005 Page 73 Reviews, January 2005 ''Maverick Magazine'' (Kent)</ref> The change in musical direction wasn't without its critics. One review for ''[[Planet Sound]]'' said \"It is the benchmark for disappointing albums in 2005.\"<ref>Earls, John.

July 2009 Reviews ''Mogo Magazine'' (London)</ref> Gavin Martin writing for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', gave the album a 5 star review, \"Blending reverberating songs of the soul, hard haunted Celtic odysseys and his raw intimate vocals, his third album shows the respect of legends is well deserved.\"<ref>Martin, Gavin. July 2009 Reviews ''The Daily Mirror'' (London)</ref>  ''The Times'' newspaper in the UK said \"Goosebumps surge up your spine.\" ''The Irish Times'' awarded the album with a 4 star review and said, \"It is a record of sweet liberty, beautiful melodies and superbly crafted songs that hint at emotional loss and glass-half- empty sentiments, but with a joyous mix of lilting airs and guitar jingle-jangle that tumble from each song. Another great record from a guy who remains one of Ireland's virtually lost yet truly great songwriters.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. June 2009 The Ticket, Page 14 ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> [[Q magazine|''Q Magazine'']] reviewed the album with \"A gifted songwriter and a throwback to the golden age of West Coast rock, his third solo album is steeped in late-'60s Americana.\"<ref>Elliott, Paul.

''Record Collector Magazine'' wrote, \"Having been making music just under the radar for well over a decade now, it's only fair that Carroll gets his turn in the spotlight.

He has released 7 albums and 23 [[Single (music)|singles]]. He is currently signed to [[One Little Indian Records]], who released his most recent studio album, ''Love Is All Or Love Is Not At All'' on 6 November 2015. The label also released remastered and expanded editions of his first 4 albums in February 2014.<ref>[http://www.indian.co.uk/site/news/marc-carroll-album-reissues-out-today One Little Indian \u2013 Marc Carroll Remasters]</ref> He has received considerable critical acclaim for his recorded output but has never reached any significant level of mainstream success. ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper have called him  \"One of Ireland's great lost songwriters, touched by genius and whose dealings with the music industry have become the stuff of legend\",<ref>Clayton-Lea,Tony. ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin) 28 February 2014 [http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/marc-carroll-ten-of-swords-world-on-a-wire-1.1706909 \"Marc Carroll -World On A Wire & Ten Of Swords\"]</ref> and British rock critic Fred Deller wrote in [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo Magazine'']] that his work was \"deserving of a far wider audience.\"<ref>Deller, Fred. \"Dust of Rumour Review\" ''Mojo Magazine'' (London) 2009</ref>\n\n==Early years/influences==\nCarroll was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland in 1972. Aged 15 he moved to London. He played in several [[Punk rock|punk]] bands during this time. A 7\" single was recorded in 1989 at a studio in [[Islington]], London. 250 copies were pressed of this record but most were subsequently destroyed. A [[test pressing]] of the record is the only known copy to exist. In an interview with [[Uncut (magazine)|''Uncut magazine'']] he said \"The [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Buddy Holly]] were the two things that changed my life.\"<ref>Hughes,Rob. \"Almost Famous\" Page 24 ''Uncut Magazine'' (London) 2005</ref> Carroll has cited [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Brian Wilson]] among his inspirations. In an article for the US magazine, ''American Songwriter'' in 2013, Carroll spoke about the diversity of his influences, \"All through my life I have been drawn to melodies and so often these melodies were delivering urgent, savvy messages and stories. Frequently these tales and stories came from so-called outsiders.  The voices that sang these songs were distinct and unique. They filled your heart and refreshed your soul. From [[Chuck Berry]] to [[Chuck D]]. Anything was possible. From the Sex Pistols to [[Captain Beefheart]]. There are no rules. From [[Crass (band)|Crass]] to Bob Dylan. There is no authority but yourself.\"<ref>Schlansky,Evan. 5 May 2013 ''American Songwriter'' [http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/05/songwriter-u-marc-carroll-a-sense-of-discovery/ \"A Sense Of Discovery\"]</ref>\n\n=== Rough Trade ===\nReturning to Dublin in 1990, Carroll was the sole songwriter and founding member of Dublin three piece power/punk band, Puppy Love Bomb. The group gained notoriety for ferocious live shows but are perhaps best remembered for the [[:wikt:provocative|provocative]] T-shirt with the slogan \"Dublin Is Dead\" which were sold at early performances.  The band recorded several radio sessions for the [[Dave Fanning]]<ref>Puppy Love Bomb 1993 Session 29 August 2013 [http://fanningsessions.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/puppy-love-bomb-1993-session/ \"Fanning Sessions Archive\"]</ref> show and were courted by record labels, notably [[Warner Brothers Music|Warner Brothers]], before eventually signing with the UK independent label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] and releasing 3 [[Single (music)|singles]]. Two [[Extended play|EPs]] were produced by [[Martin Carr]] of [[The Boo Radleys]]. The band toured across Europe with [[Bob Mould]]'s post [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] outfit, [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]]. Mould joined the band on the last night of the tour to play a version of [[The Beatles]] classic song, [[Ticket to Ride (song)|''Ticket To Ride'']].<ref>''Hot Press Magazine'' 16 November 1994 [http://fanningsessions.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/puppy-love-bomb-1993-session/ \"Interview Quote\"]</ref> No album ever materialised as the label fell into financial difficulties and the band split acrimoniously after a final show at the [[South by Southwest]] Festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Carroll returned to London where Rough Trade took over his management. The group's official recorded output has been out of print since 1994. Although the band only released 10 songs commercially, outtakes, radio sessions, demos and unreleased material have surfaced on several bootleg CDs originating from Japan with the most popular title being \"Destroy All Melody\" which features live performances from 1992 and a recording of \"Ticket To Ride\" performed with Bob Mould.  Puppy Love Bomb's recorded output and copyright is now under the ownership of One Little Indian Records. \n....\n\n===1996\u20131999===\nThe Hormones were a rock band formed in London in 1996. Carroll was the sole songwriter for the group, whose sound was described as a mixture between [[Teenage Fanclub]] and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref>Irish Music DB July 1998 [http://irishmusicdb.com/h/hormones/frame.htm \"Singles Review\"]</ref> Carroll was the founding member and songwriter for the band who released their debut single in 1996 as part of the Trade2/Island records singles club. The band members were Jez Housden on Bass and former [[Guns n' Wankers]] and [[The Wildhearts|Wildhearts]] drummer, Pat Walters. The group eventually signed to [[Richard Branson]]'s [[V2 Records|V2]] label and released 5 singles. The third single \"Mr. Wilson\" was Carroll's tribute to [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], the lyrics almost entirely consisting of Beach Boys song titles. Brian Wilson heard the track and Carroll was invited to the legendary songwriter's birthday show at New York City's Beacon Theatre in 1999. An album, ''Where Old Ghosts Meet'' (a reference from ''[[On Raglan Road]]'' by [[Patrick Kavanagh]]) was released in 1998 but deleted the same week. It has been listed in a book ''101 Irish Records You Need to Hear Before You Die''.<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. ''101 Irish Records (You Need To Hear Before You Die)''  Page 106, Liberties Press 2011</ref> The band featured in the wedding episode of US TV show ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''. A track written by Carroll and originally issued as a B-side, \"Tired Old Souls\", was featured in the program. The band toured consistently throughout the UK and Europe. Carroll also performed with the Scottish Poet/Songwriter [[Eric Bogle]] at the Weavers Club in London in 1996.  The band opened for The Cranberries on a European tour in 1999. A 2CD edition of the album was issued in Japan on the Excellent label in 2002 in a limited run of 1000 copies. The bonus disc featured B-sides and unreleased material. A second pressing of the vinyl edition was issued on the Velvet label in Japan in a pressing of 500 copies. The band split in 1999 after a show in [[Madrid]], Spain and the recorded output remains out of print. A multi disc (6CD) bootleg set , \"On A Quiet Street \u2013 The Complete Where Old Ghosts Meet Sessions\" was released on the Last Waltz label in Japan in 2003. It included demos, outtakes, alternate mixes, radio sessions and unreleased material. Carroll has never performed any of these songs live since 1999. The Hormones released 5 singles from the ''Where Old Ghosts Meet'' album, with each single featuring 3 exclusive non album B-sides which added up to 15 extra songs that were not included on the original album.\n\n===Solo period (1999\u2013present)===\n\n====Universal Music/Evangeline Recorded Works/High Noon Recordings====\nCarroll signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] in 1999 and recorded his first solo album, ''Ten of Swords'' later that year. 3 singles were released in Ireland only. Carroll played all of the instruments himself as well as taking on co-production duties with longtime recording partner, Adi Winman.<ref>Adi Winman [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/adi-winman-mn0000928217 \"AllMusic\"] 2014</ref> Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] Guitarist, [[Craig Gannon]] played on several tracks. Gannon also toured the album with Carroll across the UK and Japan in 2002. The album featured Andrew Stidman, drummer of UK rock band, [[The Wildhearts]] on one song. The album was hampered by further record company problems. The UK label refused to release the record. In an interview with ''The Irish Times'' in 2005 Carroll said, \"Sometimes record companies will sign you up so no-one else can, and that happened to me. I was left dangling at Universal for two years of my life so I had no hesitation in saying goodbye. I live and breathe Music. I don't know anything else.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea,Tony. 31 March 2005 Interview. ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> The Irish division of Universal pressed the album and sent it to media but it was withdrawn a week before its scheduled release date. Legendary UK A&R figure, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]] eventually released the album on his Evangeline label in 2002 and the record was met with critical acclaim with UK music magazine ''Uncut'' awarding it a 4 star review and calling it \"One of the finest debuts of recent times.\"<ref>Hughes, Rob. 2003 Reviews ''Uncut Magazine'' (London) [http://www.uncut.co.uk/marc-carroll/marc-carroll-all-wrongs-reversed-review \"All Wrongs Reversed\"]</ref>\n\nThe album received mainly positive critical feedback.

''Hot Press Magazine'' (Dublin)</ref>  ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote \"His dealings with the record industry are fast becoming stuff of legend but he delivers a wide range of musical goods with palpable passion.\"<ref>Meagher, John. February 2003 ''The Irish Independent'' (Dublin)</ref>  ''The Irish Times'' in an interview with Carroll in 2005 wrote that \"those who skipped over 'Row The Boat Ashore'  on ''Ten of Swords'' and worried about the inclusion of 'On Raglan Road' on ''All Wrongs Reversed'' were missing the point and the music.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. 31 March 2005 Interview ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> The cover of the album is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the infamous [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] label, '[[Trade Mark of Quality]]'. The album title came from a Bob Dylan 10 LP Bootleg set of the same name. The Japanese edition of the album included two bonus tracks and was issued in a red sleeve. It was reissued again with different packaging by High Noon Recordings in 2006. In 2014 One Little Indian released a [[remastered]] and expanded edition of  ''Ten of Swords'' as part of a comprehensive overhaul of Carroll's back catalogue.<ref>One Little Indian, 20 January 2014 [http://www.indian.co.uk/site/news/marc-carroll-album-reissues-out-today \"Marc Carroll Reissues\"]</ref>\n\nEvangeline released ''All Wrongs Reversed'', a compilation of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities in 2003. The original album contained 11 songs including a cover of Bob Dylan's \"[[Gates of Eden (song)|Gates of Eden]]\". Later that year the song appeared as a download on the official Bob Dylan webpage. The album also included another Dylan song, \"[[Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power)|Senor, Tales of Yankee Power]]\". Marc Carroll has also recorded Dylan's \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" as a B-side on the UK single \"Crashpad Number\" and \"[[Tombstone Blues]]\" for ''Uncut'' Magazine's ''Highway 61 Revisited...Revisted'' tribute CD.  Rock critic and author, [[Johnny Rogan]] reviewed the album for ''Mojo'' saying \"A classy compendium of lost songs and rarities, as ever, his pop sensibility is positively tangible, permeating almost every track.\"<ref>Rogan, Johnny. July 2003 Reviews Page 100, ''Mojo Magazine'' (London)</ref> The Album was reissued again in different packaging by High Noon in 2006. In 2014 One Little Indian released a remastered and completely revised edition of the album that duplicated only 5 songs from the original while adding 10 previously unreleased tracks, including \"2541\", \"The Main\" and \"Now That You Know Me\", all of which were written by former Husker Du drummer and songwriter, [[Grant Hart]].  Carroll's first show as a solo artist was with Hart in 1995.  ''All Wrongs Reversed'' also featured a cover version of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song, \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\". The track was originally released in the US only on ''Five Way Street \u2013 A Tribute To Buffalo Springfield''.\n\nIn 2005 Evangeline released the second album, ''World on a Wire''. The sound of the album was vastly different with the bulk of the songs being written on the piano and with string arrangements. ''Uncut magazine'' awarded the album a 4 star review writing, \"For the follow up to the mighty 'Ten of Swords' Carroll has dampened the psych pop fizz for a slower dazzle and it's the more layered arrangements that set these wonderful songs of personal faith aglow.\"<ref>Hughes, Rob. January 2005 ''Uncut Magazine'' (London)</ref> ''Mojo magazine'' in their review wrote, \"He draws out some fetching melodies, none better than ''No Time at All'' which encapsulates his striking ability to make coherent music about inner confusion.\"<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil. January 2005 ''Mojo Magazine'' (London)</ref>  ''The Irish Times'' with another 4 star review said, \"The truth is the guy is something of a genius; On ''World on a Wire'' he has opted for strings of a more mellow nature and created a record of warmth, truth, beauty and something approximating a career best. If Bob Dylan raised on an aural diet of Brian Wilson rather than [[Woody Guthrie]] appeals to you, then prepare to be blown away.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. 4 February 2005 ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> Ireland's ''Hot Press magazine'' noted \"fans of [[Leonard Cohen|Cohen]], [[Jeff Buckley|Buckley]], [[Nick Cave|Cave]] and [[Johnny Cash|Cash]] should find plenty of resonance on this brave artistic statement.\"<ref>O'Hare, Colm. February 2005 Reviews ''Hot Press Magazine'' (Dublin)</ref>  ''Maverick Magazine'' in their review picked up on Carroll's lyric writing, \"There is a darkness and quite startling intensity to his lyrics that can make the listener feel decidedly uncomfortable.\"<ref>Issue 31 February 2005 Page 73 Reviews, January 2005 ''Maverick Magazine'' (Kent)</ref> The change in musical direction wasn't without its critics. One review for ''[[Planet Sound]]'' said \"It is the benchmark for disappointing albums in 2005.\"<ref>Earls, John.

The album was recorded with longtime engineer/producer, Adi Winman. Carroll played all the instruments on the recording. ''Uncut Magazine'' gave the album a 4 star review<ref>Williamson, Nigel July 2009 Reviews ''Uncut Magazine'' (London)</ref> and Fred Dellar in a 4 star review for ''Mojo'' wrote \"Marc Carroll is something special, a performer in for the long term and deserving of a far wider audience.\"<ref>Dellar, Fred. July 2009 Reviews ''Mogo Magazine'' (London)</ref> Gavin Martin writing for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', gave the album a 5 star review, \"Blending reverberating songs of the soul, hard haunted Celtic odysseys and his raw intimate vocals, his third album shows the respect of legends is well deserved.\"<ref>Martin, Gavin. July 2009 Reviews ''The Daily Mirror'' (London)</ref>  ''The Times'' newspaper in the UK said \"Goosebumps surge up your spine.\" ''The Irish Times'' awarded the album with a 4 star review and said, \"It is a record of sweet liberty, beautiful melodies and superbly crafted songs that hint at emotional loss and glass-half- empty sentiments, but with a joyous mix of lilting airs and guitar jingle-jangle that tumble from each song. Another great record from a guy who remains one of Ireland's virtually lost yet truly great songwriters.\"<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. June 2009 The Ticket, Page 14 ''The Irish Times'' (Dublin)</ref> [[Q magazine|''Q Magazine'']] reviewed the album with \"A gifted songwriter and a throwback to the golden age of West Coast rock, his third solo album is steeped in late-'60s Americana.\"<ref>Elliott, Paul.

It is particularly notable for being the band in which both [[Phil Lynott]] and guitarist [[Gary Moore]] first played professionally.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe band was formed in August 1967, comprising Brendan 'Brush' Shiels on bass guitar, Noel 'Nollaig' Bridgeman on drums, Bernard \"Ben\" Cheevers on guitar,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Intruders |url=http://www.irishshowbands.net/bgintruders.htm |website=Irishshowbands.net |accessdate=23 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616035141/http://www.irishshowbands.net/bgintruders.htm |archivedate=16 June 2018}}</ref> and [[Phil Lynott]] on vocals. Shiels and Cheevers had played together in a number of groups in Dublin before forming Skid Row. The band's first gig was in September 1967 in a basement club in Lower Abbey Street in Dublin 1.\nCheevers left the band in September 1968 to continue working full-time in the electrical industry.  Before his departure, the search for a suitably proficient guitarist resulted in Gary Moore joining the band as a fifth member. Moore and Cheevers both played in the band for a short 'hand-over' period. Robbie Brennan temporarily replaced original drummer Bridgeman until June 1969 and Cheevers was replaced by the 16-year-old Gary Moore in mid 1968, and the band recorded a [[single (music)|single]], \"New Places, Old Faces\" / \"Misdemeanour Dream Felicity\", for the Irish Song Records label (the only released recording of Lynott with Skid Row).\n\nLater that year Shiels dropped Lynott from the line-up, converting Skid Row to a [[power trio]] by making Shiels the lead vocalist.<ref>[http://brushshiels.com/ ''A Brief History of Skid Row'' on the Brush Shiels - Skid Row website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517164426/http://www.brushshiels.com/ |date=17 May 2007 }}</ref> By way of compensation, Shiels gave him a bass guitar he had bought from former musician [[Robert Ballagh]] for \u00a349 in 1967 while with the Uptown Band, he taught Lynott to play bass and, after a stint with 'Orphanage', Lynott went on to international fame as founder, bassist and vocalist for [[Thin Lizzy]].<ref>''Hot Press: Special Philip Lynott Issue'' (24 February 2011)</ref><ref name=\"mrdeluxe\">{{Cite web|url=http://mrdeluxe.tripod.com/hisbot.htm|title=HIStory of the Brush|website=Mrdeluxe.tripod.com}}</ref> The band recorded a second single for 'Song', \"Saturday Morning Man\" / \"Mervyn Aldridge\".  These two singles, plus three tracks from a [[BBC]] recording, were issued on the 'Hux'  label as ''Live and on Song'' in April 2006. At the end of 2006 a number of Skid Row demo tapes featuring Phil Lynott were discovered. These were his earliest recordings (from 1968) and had been presumed lost for decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0105/lynottp.html|title=Fans' joy as Lynott demos unearthed|website=Rte.ie}}</ref>\n\n===''Skid'' and ''34 Hours''===\nWith the returning Bridgeman, Skid Row played support to some of the great rock groups of the 1960s, including [[Fleetwood Mac]] in January 1970.  Moore was influenced by the Fleetwood Mac guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], who was in turn impressed by Moore's guitar playing and introduced him to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia/CBS]] record company. A third single, \"Sandie\u2019s Gone (Part 1)\" / \"Sandie\u2019s Gone (Part 2)\", was released on the band's new label in April 1970, and a number of sessions and concerts were also recorded for the BBC during this period. The band released its first album ''[[Skid (album)|Skid]]'', in October 1970. A second LP, entitled ''[[34 Hours]]'' - so called because it took them a mere 34 hours to record it - was released in early 1971, preceded by the single \"Night Of The Warm Witch\" / \"Mr. De-Luxe\". Skid Row performed on the legendary German TV music show ''Beat Club'' on 18 March 1971. There were short tours of Europe (October 1970, with [[Canned Heat]]) and of the USA (October/November 1970 and August and October 1971).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.garymoorefc.com/en/tourdates_1971|title=Skid Row tour dates, 1971|website=Garymoorefc.com}}</ref> A widely bootlegged show billed as \"The Whiskey, Los Angeles, August 5, 1970\", and featuring [[John Bonham]] as a guest, is more likely from August 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://the-discographer.dk/gary-moore-bible.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830181807/http://the-discographer.dk/gary-moore-bible.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Gary Moore Bible''|archivedate=30 August 2011}}</ref> A third album was recorded in the Autumn of 1971 but Moore left the band in December 1971 just before another planned US tour. He was temporarily replaced by [[Eric Bell]] (from Thin Lizzy) for some live appearances before [[Paul Chapman (musician)|Paul Chapman]] became the band's full-time guitarist. Moore later played with Thin Lizzy, replacing Eric Bell. Chapman overdubbed Moore's guitar tracks on the unreleased album but neither version was made public for almost twenty years. As the band faltered, Chapman left in July 1972 (later joining [[UFO (band)|UFO]]). Shiels then teamed with drummer [[John Wilson (drummer)|John Wilson]] (ex-[[Them (band)|Them]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]] and [[Stud (band)|Stud]]) and future [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] guitarist Adrian Fisher to form a band named simply 'Brush'.\n\n===Changing lineups===\nSkid Row reformed in Ireland in 1973, initially with Shiels, Wilson, singer Eamonn Gibney (ex-Alyce) and guitarist [[Ed Deane]], later adding keyboard player [[Kevin McAlea]]. The Shiels/Deane/Wilson line-up released the single \"Dublin City Angels\" / \"Slow Down\" (in 1971 according to Deane's website, but this seems too early).<ref name=\"deane\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eddeane.com/discography.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911134715/http://www.eddeane.com/discography.htm|url-status=dead|title=Ed Deane discography|archivedate=11 September 2008}}</ref> John Wilson was replaced by Paddy Freeney before the band split again in early 1974. For the next few months Shiels played in the 'Bell-Brush Band' with Eric Bell and Timmy Creedon (drums, ex-Orphanage), sometimes joined by Eamonn Gibney. At the end of the year Shiels, Moore and Bridgeman briefly reunited for a series of gigs, and a 1975 line-up of Shiels (guitar/vocals), Bridgeman, Jimi Slevin (lead guitar/vocals, ex-Alyce, ex-Peggy's Leg) (born June 1950, Dublin), Timmy Creedon (second drummer/vocals) and Johann Brady (bass) recorded the Skid Row single \"The Spanish Lady\" / \"Elvira\".<ref name=\"slevin\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220125531/http://www.jimi-slevin.net/AudioSamples.htm|title=Jimi Slevin: Audio Samples|date=20 February 2012|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> In 1976 Jody Pollard (guitar, ex-Elmer Fudd) replaced Pat O'Farrell in a line-up with Shiels (vocals/mandolin), Bridgeman (drums), John Brady (bass) and Dave Gaynor (drums), recording the Phil Lynott-produced double A-sided single \"Coming Home Again\" / \"Fight Your Heart Out\" and unreleased track \"Skid Row Flashback\".<ref name=\"pollard\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jodypollard.com/|title=Jody Pollard \u2013 Singer Songwriter|website=Jodypollard.com}}</ref> The 1976 double-disc live album of Rock n' Roll standards ''Alive And Kickin'' featured Shiels, Bridgeman, Brady, Pollard, Gaynor and Ian Anderson.

Lead singer [[Sebastian Bach]] recalled,\n{{quote|When (Skid Row) got signed to Atlantic, Gary Moore heard about it and said we could have the name for $35,000 U.S. dollars. \"We have to pay Gary Moore 35 grand to use the name,\" and so we, as a band, did buy the name from Gary Moore.

He also thanked the other Skid Row \"for the generosity of spirit in acknowledging the contribution of the original Skid Row\" by using the name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/brushshielsmusic|title=Brush Shiels on MySpace Music|website=Myspace.com}}</ref> In January 2012 Shiels issued a public request to [[Jon Bon Jovi]] via [[YouTube]] to contact him about the use of the name 'Skid Row'.

It is particularly notable for being the band in which both [[Phil Lynott]] and guitarist [[Gary Moore]] first played professionally.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe band was formed in August 1967, comprising Brendan 'Brush' Shiels on bass guitar, Noel 'Nollaig' Bridgeman on drums, Bernard \"Ben\" Cheevers on guitar,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Intruders |url=http://www.irishshowbands.net/bgintruders.htm |website=Irishshowbands.net |accessdate=23 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616035141/http://www.irishshowbands.net/bgintruders.htm |archivedate=16 June 2018}}</ref> and [[Phil Lynott]] on vocals. Shiels and Cheevers had played together in a number of groups in Dublin before forming Skid Row. The band's first gig was in September 1967 in a basement club in Lower Abbey Street in Dublin 1.\nCheevers left the band in September 1968 to continue working full-time in the electrical industry.  Before his departure, the search for a suitably proficient guitarist resulted in Gary Moore joining the band as a fifth member. Moore and Cheevers both played in the band for a short 'hand-over' period. Robbie Brennan temporarily replaced original drummer Bridgeman until June 1969 and Cheevers was replaced by the 16-year-old Gary Moore in mid 1968, and the band recorded a [[single (music)|single]], \"New Places, Old Faces\" / \"Misdemeanour Dream Felicity\", for the Irish Song Records label (the only released recording of Lynott with Skid Row).\n\nLater that year Shiels dropped Lynott from the line-up, converting Skid Row to a [[power trio]] by making Shiels the lead vocalist.<ref>[http://brushshiels.com/ ''A Brief History of Skid Row'' on the Brush Shiels - Skid Row website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517164426/http://www.brushshiels.com/ |date=17 May 2007 }}</ref> By way of compensation, Shiels gave him a bass guitar he had bought from former musician [[Robert Ballagh]] for \u00a349 in 1967 while with the Uptown Band, he taught Lynott to play bass and, after a stint with 'Orphanage', Lynott went on to international fame as founder, bassist and vocalist for [[Thin Lizzy]].<ref>''Hot Press: Special Philip Lynott Issue'' (24 February 2011)</ref><ref name=\"mrdeluxe\">{{Cite web|url=http://mrdeluxe.tripod.com/hisbot.htm|title=HIStory of the Brush|website=Mrdeluxe.tripod.com}}</ref> The band recorded a second single for 'Song', \"Saturday Morning Man\" / \"Mervyn Aldridge\".  These two singles, plus three tracks from a [[BBC]] recording, were issued on the 'Hux'  label as ''Live and on Song'' in April 2006. At the end of 2006 a number of Skid Row demo tapes featuring Phil Lynott were discovered. These were his earliest recordings (from 1968) and had been presumed lost for decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0105/lynottp.html|title=Fans' joy as Lynott demos unearthed|website=Rte.ie}}</ref>\n\n===''Skid'' and ''34 Hours''===\nWith the returning Bridgeman, Skid Row played support to some of the great rock groups of the 1960s, including [[Fleetwood Mac]] in January 1970.  Moore was influenced by the Fleetwood Mac guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], who was in turn impressed by Moore's guitar playing and introduced him to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia/CBS]] record company. A third single, \"Sandie\u2019s Gone (Part 1)\" / \"Sandie\u2019s Gone (Part 2)\", was released on the band's new label in April 1970, and a number of sessions and concerts were also recorded for the BBC during this period. The band released its first album ''[[Skid (album)|Skid]]'', in October 1970. A second LP, entitled ''[[34 Hours]]'' - so called because it took them a mere 34 hours to record it - was released in early 1971, preceded by the single \"Night Of The Warm Witch\" / \"Mr. De-Luxe\". Skid Row performed on the legendary German TV music show ''Beat Club'' on 18 March 1971. There were short tours of Europe (October 1970, with [[Canned Heat]]) and of the USA (October/November 1970 and August and October 1971).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.garymoorefc.com/en/tourdates_1971|title=Skid Row tour dates, 1971|website=Garymoorefc.com}}</ref> A widely bootlegged show billed as \"The Whiskey, Los Angeles, August 5, 1970\", and featuring [[John Bonham]] as a guest, is more likely from August 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://the-discographer.dk/gary-moore-bible.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830181807/http://the-discographer.dk/gary-moore-bible.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Gary Moore Bible''|archivedate=30 August 2011}}</ref> A third album was recorded in the Autumn of 1971 but Moore left the band in December 1971 just before another planned US tour. He was temporarily replaced by [[Eric Bell]] (from Thin Lizzy) for some live appearances before [[Paul Chapman (musician)|Paul Chapman]] became the band's full-time guitarist. Moore later played with Thin Lizzy, replacing Eric Bell. Chapman overdubbed Moore's guitar tracks on the unreleased album but neither version was made public for almost twenty years. As the band faltered, Chapman left in July 1972 (later joining [[UFO (band)|UFO]]). Shiels then teamed with drummer [[John Wilson (drummer)|John Wilson]] (ex-[[Them (band)|Them]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]] and [[Stud (band)|Stud]]) and future [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] guitarist Adrian Fisher to form a band named simply 'Brush'.\n\n===Changing lineups===\nSkid Row reformed in Ireland in 1973, initially with Shiels, Wilson, singer Eamonn Gibney (ex-Alyce) and guitarist [[Ed Deane]], later adding keyboard player [[Kevin McAlea]]. The Shiels/Deane/Wilson line-up released the single \"Dublin City Angels\" / \"Slow Down\" (in 1971 according to Deane's website, but this seems too early).<ref name=\"deane\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eddeane.com/discography.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911134715/http://www.eddeane.com/discography.htm|url-status=dead|title=Ed Deane discography|archivedate=11 September 2008}}</ref> John Wilson was replaced by Paddy Freeney before the band split again in early 1974.

Federal funding is instead provided through the [[Territorial Formula Financing]] (TFF) program.\n\n==History==\nThe basics of equalization payments have been around since [[Canadian confederation]] when the federal government had most of the taxation powers. The federal government would make [[transfer payments]] to the provinces to cover their needs. There was no obligation that these transfer payments had to reflect the amount collected in each province and thus wealth was always redistributed. Equalization payments happen via the federal treasury.\n\nA formal system of equalization payments was first introduced in 1957.<ref name=\"LOP_\u00c9dison_20130904\">{{Citation| title = Canada's Equalization Formula| access-date = May 25, 2019| url = https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/200820E |first=\u00c9dison |last=Roy-C\u00e9sar|date=November 10, 2008 |work=[[Library of Parliament]] (LOP)}} Revised September 4, 2013</ref><ref group=\"Notes\">The idea was based on the proposals of American [[economist]] [[James M. Buchanan]] and they were introduced mainly to help the struggling [[Atlantic provinces]] who were seeing low rates of growth and high rate of emigration to central Canada.</ref>\n\nThe original program had the goal of giving each province the same per-capita revenue as the two wealthiest provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, in three tax bases: personal income taxes, corporate income taxes and succession duties (inheritance taxes). Five years later, 50 per cent of natural resource revenues were included as the fourth tax base.  At the same time, however, the standard of the two wealthiest provinces was lowered to the national average. In 1967 the system was redesigned to work with every government revenue scheme with the exception of energy; this gave Canada by far the world's most generous system of equalization payments.\n\nThe rise in energy prices and the resulting increase in provincial natural resource royalties in the late 1970s created several problems for the equalization formula.  The need for amendments to the formula became clear when the traditional \"have\" province of Ontario qualified for equalization payments in 1978.  This result went against the spirit of the system and would have led to substantial costs for the federal government; it was agreed that Ontario should be excluded from receiving payments.  In 1982, the equalization standard was shifted from the national average to the average of the five \"representative\" provinces: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\nThe [[Canada Act 1982]], which amended the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]], included the rights of the poorer provinces to equalization payments.

It is made up of estimates of provincial tax bases, actual provincial revenues and population.  By using the same tax base definition across all provinces the representative tax system can be used to compare the ability of individual provinces to raise revenues.   \"Have provinces\" are those able to generate more tax revenue per person than the national average, while have not provinces would have revenue per person below the national average.\n\nThe individual revenue sources are grouped into five categories: personal income taxes, business income taxes, consumption taxes, up to 50 percent of natural resource revenue, and property taxes and miscellaneous.\n\nEach revenue category has a separate tax base.  Each province is allocated an \"equalization entitlement\" equal to the amount by which its fiscal capacity is below the average fiscal capacity of all provinces. This is known as the \"10 province standard\".<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" /> Provinces who have a fiscal capacity above the 10 province standard are known as the \"have\" provinces while those below are the \"have not\" provinces. Equalization payments are then determined based on the provinces' relation to this average. The payments are typically adjusted to ensure fairness between the provinces and are designed to provide a net fiscal benefit to receiving provinces from their resources equivalent to half of their per capita resource revenues.<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" /> Equalization payments are further adjusted to ensure the program aligns with the overall growth of the Canadian economy (based on a three-year moving average of GDP).<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" />\n\nNote: According to the Department of Finance, \"provinces get the greater of the amount they would receive by fully excluding natural resource revenues, or by excluding 50% of natural resource revenues.\"<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\nBelow are equalization payments from 2010-11 to 2019\u201320:<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Table A \u2013 Equalization payments to \"have not\" provinces\n!Province\n!2020-21\n$M\n!2019-20\n$M\n!2018-19\n$M\n!2017-18\n$M\n!2016-17\n$M\n!2015-16\n$M\n!2014-15\n$M\n!2013-14\n$M\n!2012-13\n$M\n!2011-12\n$M\n!2010-11\n$M\n|-\n!Quebec\n|13 253\n|13,124\n|11,732\n|11,081\n|10,030\n|9,521\n|9,286\n|7,833\n|7,391\n|7,815\n|8,552\n|-\n!Manitoba\n|2 510\n|2,255\n|2,037\n|1,820\n|1,736\n|1,738\n|1,750\n|1,792\n|1,671\n|1,666\n|1,826\n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|2 146\n|2,015\n|1,933\n|1,779\n|1,722\n|1,690\n|1,619\n|1,458\n|1,268\n|1,167\n|1,110\n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|2 210\n|2,023\n|1,874\n|1,760\n|1,708\n|1,669\n|1,666\n|1,513\n|1,495\n|1,483\n|1,581\n|-\n!Ontario\n|0\n|0\n|963\n|1,424\n|2,304\n|2,363\n|1,988\n|3,169\n|3,261\n|2,200\n|972\n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|454\n|419\n|419\n|390\n|380\n|361\n|360\n|340\n|337\n|329\n|330\n|-\n!Total\n|20 573\n|19,619\n|18,958\n|18,254\n|17,880\n|17,341\n|16,669\n|16,105\n|16,423\n|14,659\n|14,372\n|}\nSource: Department of Finance\n\nThe following \"have provinces\" will not qualify for equalization payments in 2019\u201320:<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\n* Ontario\n*Alberta\n* British Columbia\n* Newfoundland and Labrador\n* Saskatchewan\n\n== Importance of equalization to provincial finances==\nAs shown in Table B, equalization payments can represent a major source of revenue for \"have not\" provinces ranging from roughly 20% of revenue in PEI to 1% to 2% in Ontario.  As this table includes all provincial revenue, including equalization and other fiscal transfers from the federal government, it represents the importance of equalization to provinces' fiscal bottom-lines.  However, it is important to keep in mind that equalization is funded by taxpayers in all provinces.  The total of roughly 4.5% represents the importance of equalization relative to all provinces' revenue, i.e., the cost of equalization relative to total provincial revenue.  For example, even though Ontario received equalization in the years covered in the Table B, it represented a net cost to the provinces.  In effect, the 4.5% total can be interpreted as representing the burden of equalization relative to total provincial revenue.   As such, the net impact of equalization in each provinces is equal to that provinces % less the total % as shown in Table B.  Using PEI as an example, on a net basis, in 2017-18 equalization represents 16.2% of total provincial revenue.   In Alberta, the burden of equalization was 4.4% of total provincial revenue in 2017-18.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\n|+Table B \u2013 Equalization payments as a percentage of total provincial revenue\n!Province\n!2017-18\n%\n!2016-17\n%\n!2015-16\n%\n|-\n!Quebec\n|9.4 \n|9.0 \n|8.7 \n|-\n!Manitoba\n|11.8 \n|11.5 \n|12.1 \n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|15.6 \n|16.1 \n|17.0 \n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|18.5 \n|18.9 \n|19.6 \n|-\n!Ontario\n|1.0 \n|1.7 \n|1.9 \n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|20.6 \n|20.5 \n|20.7 \n|-\n!Total\n|4.4 \n|4.5 \n|4.6 \n|}\nSource:  Calculated using Statistics Canada, Table 10-10-0017-01 and equalization payments as reported in provincial public accounts.  Total provincial revenue includes equalization payments and other transfers from the Federal government.  Total includes revenue from all provinces, both \"have and have not\" provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nCompared to Table B, Table C shows equalization payments as a percentage of Provincial Revenue subject to equalization instead of total provincial revenue.  As such it does not include equalization or other federal transfers to provinces.  Revenues subject to equalization are in effect the vast majority of taxes levied by provinces and municipalities, often referred to as own source revenues.  One notable revenue source that is not equalized is user fees.  Given the definition of provincial revenue used in Table C, the percentages show in the table take on a specific interpretation.  Namely, they can be interpreted as how much additional tax revenue individual provinces would need to replace equalization transfers.  While this is not probable or realistic for some provinces, Ontario will no longer receive equalization in 2019-20 and equalization payments ended in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2007-08.  The objective of this exercise is to illustrate the importance of equalization to provincial finances.  For example, in 2019-20 PEI would have to increase its own source revenues by roughly 39.2 percent to offset equalization transfers.  Similar to Table B, the total of 5.7% can be interpreted as the cost of equalization relative to provincial revenue subject to equalization.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Table C \u2013 Equalization payments as a percentage of provincial revenue subject to equalization\n!Province\n!2019-20\n%\n!2018-19\n%\n|-\n!Quebec\n|15.4\n|14.6\n|-\n!Manitoba\n|18.2\n|19.1\n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|26.2\n|26.1\n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|35.3\n|34.6\n|-\n!Ontario\n|0\n|0.8\n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|39.2\n|41.4\n|-\n!Total\n|5.7\n|5.9\n|}\nSource: Calculation based on administrative data from the Department of Finance.

Much of the gap stems from huge differences in geography, population, and economic activity among provinces, which make any attempt to \"equalize\" these differences challenging.  As shown in the table below, PEI's population is less than 1% of the Canadian total, while Ontario's population is close to 40%.  Alberta's GDP per capita is 41% higher than the national average while PEI's is roughly 24% lower&nbsp;\u2013 Alberta's GDP per capita is 185% that of PEI yet the average personal income in Alberta is 159% that of PEI.\n\nHowever, the stated goal of equalization in Canada is '''not''' to equalize economies or ensure that economic outcomes are equal.  As stated above, it is to \"ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation\".   Per capita data is central to measuring if provincial outcomes are comparable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"\n|+Table D \u2013 Economic activity by province\n! scope=\"col\" | Province<br />or<br />Territory\n! scope=\"col\" | Population<br />(2017)\n!Share of \nCanadian total\n\n%\n! scope=\"col\" | GDP<br>(million<br />2007 CAD$, 2017)\n! scope=\"col\" | GDP per<br />capita<br />(2007 CAD$, 2017)\n!GDP per capita <br/> difference from <br/> Canadian average\n\n%\n! scope=\"col\" | Average Total<br />Income<br>(CAD$, 2015)\n!Average total income, <br/> difference from <br/> Canadian average\n\n%\n|- align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#e6e6e6\"\n| align=\"left\" |[[File:Flag of Canada.svg|30px]] [[Canada]]||'''{{nts|36712658}}'''\n|100\n|'''{{nts|1751898}}'''||'''{{nts|55405}}'''\n|0||'''{{nts|41129}}'''\n|0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{BC}}|| {{nts|4945559}}\n|13.5|| {{nts|228195}} ||{{nts|53267}}\n|  -3.8||{{nts|40196}}\n|  -2.3\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{AB}}|| {{nts|4262642}}\n|11.6|| {{nts|304709}} ||{{nts|78100}}\n|  +41.0||{{nts|53408}}\n|  +29.9\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{SK}}|| {{nts|1155034}}\n|3.1|| {{nts|60592}} ||{{nts|70138}}\n|  +26.6||{{nts|40933}}\n|  -0.5\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{MB}}|| {{nts|1340776}}\n|3.7|| {{nts|57250}} ||{{nts|50820}}\n|  -8.3||{{nts|36795}}\n|  -10.5\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{ON}}|| {{nts|14153806}}\n|38.6|| {{nts|651932}} ||{{nts|55322}}\n|  -0.15||{{nts|42643}}\n|  +3.7\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{QC}}|| {{nts|8329664}}\n|22.7|| {{nts|328688}} ||{{nts|46126}}\n|  -16.7||{{nts|36491}}\n|  -11.3\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NB}}|| {{nts|768212}}\n|2.1|| {{nts|27363}} ||{{nts|43818}}\n|  -20.9||{{nts|34164}}\n|  -16.9\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{PE}}|| {{nts|151477}}\n|0.4|| {{nts|4883}} ||{{nts|42157}}\n|  -23.9||{{nts|33632}}\n|  -18.2\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NS}}|| {{nts|943373}}\n|2.6|| {{nts|33470}} ||{{nts|42640}}\n|  -23.0||{{nts|36108}}\n|  -12.2\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NL}}|| {{nts|528463}}\n|1.4|| {{nts|26773}} ||{{nts|56935}}\n|  +2.8||{{nts|35345}}\n|  -14.1\n|}\n\n{{refbegin|}}\nSource: [[Statistics Canada]]: GDP (totals),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610040201&pickMembers%5B0%5D=2.2&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.1|title=Table 36-10-0402-01 - Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry provinces and territories|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> Population,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901|title=Table 17-0009-01 - Population estimates, quarterly |last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> [[Canada Revenue Agency]]: Taxation Statistics 2015 taxation year<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/prog-policy/stats/t1-final-stats/2015-tax-year/tbl1-eng.pdf | title= Final Table 1: General statement by province and territory of taxation  | author= Canada Revenue Agency | authorlink= Canada Revenue Agency| date=2017 | accessdate=October 14, 2018}}</ref>\n{{refend}}<br />Table E shows provincial own source tax revenue per capita, equalization per capita and the sum of the two.

Due to the zero-sum nature of the formula, increases in entitlements for some provinces necessarily lead to decreases for others.Normally, under the equalization formula, equalization payments normally go down for every dollar increase in a province's ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if a province's economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, equalization payments decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not provinces an incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher equalization payments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smart|first=Michael|date=13 September 2006|title=Raising taxes through Equalization|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~msmart/wp/raisingtaxes-cje-final.pdf|journal=|location=Toronto, ON|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> At a October 25, 2001 talk presented at the \"Equalization: Welfare Trap or Helping Hand?\" conference, the American [[economist]] [[James M.

In those two decades more attention was being focused on federal/states intergovernmental fiscal structures between two constitutionally independent fiscal systems which ultimately affect \"fiscal resources of individual citizens\".</ref> At the 2001 conference, co-sponsored by [[Atlantic Institute for Market Studies|AIMS]]/[[Montreal Economic Institute|MEI]]/[[Frontier Centre for Public Policy|FCPP]], Buchanan admitted that this idea had flaws, and that it had been criticized for creating a culture of dependence in provinces with relatively low fiscal capacities.<ref>{{cite conference|date=April 2002|title=Fiscal Equalization Revisited|url=http://www.aims.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fiscal.pdf|location=Montreal|access-date=May 24, 2019|work=[[Atlantic Institute for Market Studies|AIMS]]/[[Montreal Economic Institute|MEI]]/[[Frontier Centre for Public Policy|FCPP]]}}</ref>\n\n===Alberta===\nThen Alberta Finance Minister [[Joe Ceci]] in a June 19, 2018 interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', said that the equalization formula had not worked \"for Alberta, even during the depths of our recession \u2013 which started in late 2014 and continued \u201915, \u201916 and part of \u201917.

He said that \"[s]ince equalization was created (in 1957), Alberta has received 0.02% of all payments, the last of which was in 1964-1965.\"<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Staples_20181221\" />\n\nAccording to an opinion column article by economist Trevor Tombe, Alberta \"pay[s] more and receive[s] less\" because of \"unequal circumstances\". Tombe said that Alberta has a younger population with more high-income earners.

Alberta collects about 21 per cent of \"Canada's corporate taxable income\".<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" /> The federal government collects more GST from Alberta because the families with higher incomes also spend more in Alberta. In 2015 Alberta had a net outflow of $27-billion.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" />\n\nIn spite of the high incomes and large income from corporate taxes, Alberta has a very low income tax rate, which is much lower than the Canadian average, but by 2017, it also has a $10.5-billion deficit. Tombe said that if Alberta had a tax rate similar to the Canadian average, the province would have a surplus not a deficit.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" /> Tombe said that Alberta has the strongest economy in Canada which means the province can raise revenue. In order for Alberta's economy to weaken to the point of qualifying for equalization payments, its economy would have to shrink by over 33 per cent which has not happened even during recessions when the price of oil dropped dramatically.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" />\n\n===Quebec===\nQuebec's high provincial taxes account for its budget surplus, although without equalization Quebec would have had a deficit.

The federal government would make [[transfer payments]] to the provinces to cover their needs. There was no obligation that these transfer payments had to reflect the amount collected in each province and thus wealth was always redistributed.

Five years later, 50 per cent of natural resource revenues were included as the fourth tax base.  At the same time, however, the standard of the two wealthiest provinces was lowered to the national average. In 1967 the system was redesigned to work with every government revenue scheme with the exception of energy; this gave Canada by far the world's most generous system of equalization payments.\n\nThe rise in energy prices and the resulting increase in provincial natural resource royalties in the late 1970s created several problems for the equalization formula.  The need for amendments to the formula became clear when the traditional \"have\" province of Ontario qualified for equalization payments in 1978.  This result went against the spirit of the system and would have led to substantial costs for the federal government; it was agreed that Ontario should be excluded from receiving payments.  In 1982, the equalization standard was shifted from the national average to the average of the five \"representative\" provinces: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\nThe [[Canada Act 1982]], which amended the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]], included the rights of the poorer provinces to equalization payments.

It is made up of estimates of provincial tax bases, actual provincial revenues and population.  By using the same tax base definition across all provinces the representative tax system can be used to compare the ability of individual provinces to raise revenues.   \"Have provinces\" are those able to generate more tax revenue per person than the national average, while have not provinces would have revenue per person below the national average.\n\nThe individual revenue sources are grouped into five categories: personal income taxes, business income taxes, consumption taxes, up to 50 percent of natural resource revenue, and property taxes and miscellaneous.\n\nEach revenue category has a separate tax base.  Each province is allocated an \"equalization entitlement\" equal to the amount by which its fiscal capacity is below the average fiscal capacity of all provinces. This is known as the \"10 province standard\".<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" /> Provinces who have a fiscal capacity above the 10 province standard are known as the \"have\" provinces while those below are the \"have not\" provinces. Equalization payments are then determined based on the provinces' relation to this average. The payments are typically adjusted to ensure fairness between the provinces and are designed to provide a net fiscal benefit to receiving provinces from their resources equivalent to half of their per capita resource revenues.<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" /> Equalization payments are further adjusted to ensure the program aligns with the overall growth of the Canadian economy (based on a three-year moving average of GDP).<ref name=\"GC_FIN_20111219\" />\n\nNote: According to the Department of Finance, \"provinces get the greater of the amount they would receive by fully excluding natural resource revenues, or by excluding 50% of natural resource revenues.\"<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\nBelow are equalization payments from 2010-11 to 2019\u201320:<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Table A \u2013 Equalization payments to \"have not\" provinces\n!Province\n!2020-21\n$M\n!2019-20\n$M\n!2018-19\n$M\n!2017-18\n$M\n!2016-17\n$M\n!2015-16\n$M\n!2014-15\n$M\n!2013-14\n$M\n!2012-13\n$M\n!2011-12\n$M\n!2010-11\n$M\n|-\n!Quebec\n|13 253\n|13,124\n|11,732\n|11,081\n|10,030\n|9,521\n|9,286\n|7,833\n|7,391\n|7,815\n|8,552\n|-\n!Manitoba\n|2 510\n|2,255\n|2,037\n|1,820\n|1,736\n|1,738\n|1,750\n|1,792\n|1,671\n|1,666\n|1,826\n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|2 146\n|2,015\n|1,933\n|1,779\n|1,722\n|1,690\n|1,619\n|1,458\n|1,268\n|1,167\n|1,110\n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|2 210\n|2,023\n|1,874\n|1,760\n|1,708\n|1,669\n|1,666\n|1,513\n|1,495\n|1,483\n|1,581\n|-\n!Ontario\n|0\n|0\n|963\n|1,424\n|2,304\n|2,363\n|1,988\n|3,169\n|3,261\n|2,200\n|972\n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|454\n|419\n|419\n|390\n|380\n|361\n|360\n|340\n|337\n|329\n|330\n|-\n!Total\n|20 573\n|19,619\n|18,958\n|18,254\n|17,880\n|17,341\n|16,669\n|16,105\n|16,423\n|14,659\n|14,372\n|}\nSource: Department of Finance\n\nThe following \"have provinces\" will not qualify for equalization payments in 2019\u201320:<ref name=\"fin.gc.ca\" />\n\n* Ontario\n*Alberta\n* British Columbia\n* Newfoundland and Labrador\n* Saskatchewan\n\n== Importance of equalization to provincial finances==\nAs shown in Table B, equalization payments can represent a major source of revenue for \"have not\" provinces ranging from roughly 20% of revenue in PEI to 1% to 2% in Ontario.  As this table includes all provincial revenue, including equalization and other fiscal transfers from the federal government, it represents the importance of equalization to provinces' fiscal bottom-lines.  However, it is important to keep in mind that equalization is funded by taxpayers in all provinces.  The total of roughly 4.5% represents the importance of equalization relative to all provinces' revenue, i.e., the cost of equalization relative to total provincial revenue.  For example, even though Ontario received equalization in the years covered in the Table B, it represented a net cost to the provinces.  In effect, the 4.5% total can be interpreted as representing the burden of equalization relative to total provincial revenue.   As such, the net impact of equalization in each provinces is equal to that provinces % less the total % as shown in Table B.  Using PEI as an example, on a net basis, in 2017-18 equalization represents 16.2% of total provincial revenue.   In Alberta, the burden of equalization was 4.4% of total provincial revenue in 2017-18.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\n|+Table B \u2013 Equalization payments as a percentage of total provincial revenue\n!Province\n!2017-18\n%\n!2016-17\n%\n!2015-16\n%\n|-\n!Quebec\n|9.4 \n|9.0 \n|8.7 \n|-\n!Manitoba\n|11.8 \n|11.5 \n|12.1 \n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|15.6 \n|16.1 \n|17.0 \n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|18.5 \n|18.9 \n|19.6 \n|-\n!Ontario\n|1.0 \n|1.7 \n|1.9 \n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|20.6 \n|20.5 \n|20.7 \n|-\n!Total\n|4.4 \n|4.5 \n|4.6 \n|}\nSource:  Calculated using Statistics Canada, Table 10-10-0017-01 and equalization payments as reported in provincial public accounts.  Total provincial revenue includes equalization payments and other transfers from the Federal government.  Total includes revenue from all provinces, both \"have and have not\" provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nCompared to Table B, Table C shows equalization payments as a percentage of Provincial Revenue subject to equalization instead of total provincial revenue.  As such it does not include equalization or other federal transfers to provinces.  Revenues subject to equalization are in effect the vast majority of taxes levied by provinces and municipalities, often referred to as own source revenues.  One notable revenue source that is not equalized is user fees.  Given the definition of provincial revenue used in Table C, the percentages show in the table take on a specific interpretation.  Namely, they can be interpreted as how much additional tax revenue individual provinces would need to replace equalization transfers.  While this is not probable or realistic for some provinces, Ontario will no longer receive equalization in 2019-20 and equalization payments ended in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2007-08.  The objective of this exercise is to illustrate the importance of equalization to provincial finances.  For example, in 2019-20 PEI would have to increase its own source revenues by roughly 39.2 percent to offset equalization transfers.  Similar to Table B, the total of 5.7% can be interpreted as the cost of equalization relative to provincial revenue subject to equalization.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Table C \u2013 Equalization payments as a percentage of provincial revenue subject to equalization\n!Province\n!2019-20\n%\n!2018-19\n%\n|-\n!Quebec\n|15.4\n|14.6\n|-\n!Manitoba\n|18.2\n|19.1\n|-\n!Nova Scotia\n|26.2\n|26.1\n|-\n!New Brunswick\n|35.3\n|34.6\n|-\n!Ontario\n|0\n|0.8\n|-\n!Prince Edward Island\n|39.2\n|41.4\n|-\n!Total\n|5.7\n|5.9\n|}\nSource: Calculation based on administrative data from the Department of Finance.

Much of the gap stems from huge differences in geography, population, and economic activity among provinces, which make any attempt to \"equalize\" these differences challenging.  As shown in the table below, PEI's population is less than 1% of the Canadian total, while Ontario's population is close to 40%.  Alberta's GDP per capita is 41% higher than the national average while PEI's is roughly 24% lower&nbsp;\u2013 Alberta's GDP per capita is 185% that of PEI yet the average personal income in Alberta is 159% that of PEI.\n\nHowever, the stated goal of equalization in Canada is '''not''' to equalize economies or ensure that economic outcomes are equal.  As stated above, it is to \"ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation\".   Per capita data is central to measuring if provincial outcomes are comparable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"\n|+Table D \u2013 Economic activity by province\n! scope=\"col\" | Province<br />or<br />Territory\n! scope=\"col\" | Population<br />(2017)\n!Share of \nCanadian total\n\n%\n! scope=\"col\" | GDP<br>(million<br />2007 CAD$, 2017)\n! scope=\"col\" | GDP per<br />capita<br />(2007 CAD$, 2017)\n!GDP per capita <br/> difference from <br/> Canadian average\n\n%\n! scope=\"col\" | Average Total<br />Income<br>(CAD$, 2015)\n!Average total income, <br/> difference from <br/> Canadian average\n\n%\n|- align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#e6e6e6\"\n| align=\"left\" |[[File:Flag of Canada.svg|30px]] [[Canada]]||'''{{nts|36712658}}'''\n|100\n|'''{{nts|1751898}}'''||'''{{nts|55405}}'''\n|0||'''{{nts|41129}}'''\n|0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{BC}}|| {{nts|4945559}}\n|13.5|| {{nts|228195}} ||{{nts|53267}}\n|  -3.8||{{nts|40196}}\n|  -2.3\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{AB}}|| {{nts|4262642}}\n|11.6|| {{nts|304709}} ||{{nts|78100}}\n|  +41.0||{{nts|53408}}\n|  +29.9\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{SK}}|| {{nts|1155034}}\n|3.1|| {{nts|60592}} ||{{nts|70138}}\n|  +26.6||{{nts|40933}}\n|  -0.5\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{MB}}|| {{nts|1340776}}\n|3.7|| {{nts|57250}} ||{{nts|50820}}\n|  -8.3||{{nts|36795}}\n|  -10.5\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{ON}}|| {{nts|14153806}}\n|38.6|| {{nts|651932}} ||{{nts|55322}}\n|  -0.15||{{nts|42643}}\n|  +3.7\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{QC}}|| {{nts|8329664}}\n|22.7|| {{nts|328688}} ||{{nts|46126}}\n|  -16.7||{{nts|36491}}\n|  -11.3\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NB}}|| {{nts|768212}}\n|2.1|| {{nts|27363}} ||{{nts|43818}}\n|  -20.9||{{nts|34164}}\n|  -16.9\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{PE}}|| {{nts|151477}}\n|0.4|| {{nts|4883}} ||{{nts|42157}}\n|  -23.9||{{nts|33632}}\n|  -18.2\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NS}}|| {{nts|943373}}\n|2.6|| {{nts|33470}} ||{{nts|42640}}\n|  -23.0||{{nts|36108}}\n|  -12.2\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |{{NL}}|| {{nts|528463}}\n|1.4|| {{nts|26773}} ||{{nts|56935}}\n|  +2.8||{{nts|35345}}\n|  -14.1\n|}\n\n{{refbegin|}}\nSource: [[Statistics Canada]]: GDP (totals),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610040201&pickMembers%5B0%5D=2.2&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.1|title=Table 36-10-0402-01 - Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry provinces and territories|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> Population,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901|title=Table 17-0009-01 - Population estimates, quarterly |last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> [[Canada Revenue Agency]]: Taxation Statistics 2015 taxation year<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/prog-policy/stats/t1-final-stats/2015-tax-year/tbl1-eng.pdf | title= Final Table 1: General statement by province and territory of taxation  | author= Canada Revenue Agency | authorlink= Canada Revenue Agency| date=2017 | accessdate=October 14, 2018}}</ref>\n{{refend}}<br />Table E shows provincial own source tax revenue per capita, equalization per capita and the sum of the two.

Due to the zero-sum nature of the formula, increases in entitlements for some provinces necessarily lead to decreases for others.Normally, under the equalization formula, equalization payments normally go down for every dollar increase in a province's ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if a province's economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, equalization payments decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not provinces an incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher equalization payments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smart|first=Michael|date=13 September 2006|title=Raising taxes through Equalization|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~msmart/wp/raisingtaxes-cje-final.pdf|journal=|location=Toronto, ON|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> At a October 25, 2001 talk presented at the \"Equalization: Welfare Trap or Helping Hand?\" conference, the American [[economist]] [[James M.

It is the province with the smallest number of people who are older than 65, which means that there are fewer CPP and OAS recipients. According to the census, \"one in eight Albertans older than 15\" earn over $100,000 annually.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" /> Only eleven per cent of Canadians live in Alberta. But 21 per cent of \"Canada's $100,000-plus earners\" live in Alberta. Alberta collects about 21 per cent of \"Canada's corporate taxable income\".<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" /> The federal government collects more GST from Alberta because the families with higher incomes also spend more in Alberta. In 2015 Alberta had a net outflow of $27-billion.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" />\n\nIn spite of the high incomes and large income from corporate taxes, Alberta has a very low income tax rate, which is much lower than the Canadian average, but by 2017, it also has a $10.5-billion deficit. Tombe said that if Alberta had a tax rate similar to the Canadian average, the province would have a surplus not a deficit.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" /> Tombe said that Alberta has the strongest economy in Canada which means the province can raise revenue. In order for Alberta's economy to weaken to the point of qualifying for equalization payments, its economy would have to shrink by over 33 per cent which has not happened even during recessions when the price of oil dropped dramatically.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" />\n\n===Quebec===\nQuebec's high provincial taxes account for its budget surplus, although without equalization Quebec would have had a deficit. Quebec residents pay almost twice as much as Albertans in taxes.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail_Tombe_20171021\" />\n\nAlberta Premier Kenney added that, since the inception in 1957 of equalization payments, \"Quebec has received equalization money every year of the program, totalling 221 billion dollars or 51 per cent of all payments.\"<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Staples_20181221\" /> According to the [[Library of Parliament]] report, Quebec receives a larger proportion mainly because of the large population in Quebec representing almost a quarter of the population of Canada.

Quebec received the \"lion's share\" of the 2001 equalization payments. In 2000, Quebec economic growth was slower than that of the other six provinces that were also eligible for payments.

It was projected to be $2-billion in 2014-2015. Late January 2012, based on access to the uncensored version of a 2006 censored federal report by Peter Gusen, then director of federal-provincial relations at the finance department, entitled 'An Operational Expenditure Need Equalization Formula for Canada', the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' alleged that Ontario and BC were shortchanged in the equalization system because wages and cost-of-living expenses were never taken into account by Ottawa.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1121339--ontario-shortchanged-in-wealth-sharing-system-censored-federal-report-suggests|title=Ontario shortchanged in wealth-sharing system, censored federal report suggests|author=Robert Benzie|date=2012-01-25|accessdate=2012-01-29|newspaper=Toronto Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1121975|title=Dwight Duncan demands Ottawa release censored report showing Ontario is shortchanged by equalization|author=Robert Benzie|date=2012-01-26|accessdate=2012-01-29|newspaper=Toronto Star}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Ontario would have qualified for the TTP payment for the first time, worth $640-million.

One of the girls sends a voice message in a WhatsApp group telling their situation. Manimaran ([[Jiiva]]) hears the message and rescues them. He is from a neighboring place called Mayavaram where he runs a local TV channel called Kokkarako TV. This is opposed by the MLA ([[R. N. R. Manohar]]), who keeps getting outsmarted by Maran. Exasperated, he pays a local goon named Vyasarpadi Malli ([[Varun (actor)|Varun]]) to kill him. Malli reaches Maran's home, where his pregnant sister Ilakkiya (Gayathri Krishna) goes into labor.\n\nMalli takes Ilakkiya to the hospital and admits her, while providing her blood. Maran reaches the hospital and finds that his sister is out of danger and has given birth to a boy. Ilakkiya asks Maran to find the person who saved her and to bring him to her so that she can properly thank him. Maran finds out that the person was Malli, who had threatened to kill him. Maran keeps calling him, asking to meet him. Eventually he finds Malli on the verge of death being backstabbed by his own henchmen. Maran beats up the henchmen who were nearby and admits Malli into Laksha Hospitals. It turns out that Malli's henchmen were ordered to torture Malli by Ashok Mithran ([[Navdeep]]), a leading advocate who was stabbed in court and who wants to know who stabbed him. He planned to torture Malli since he knows who did it. Mithran sends more goons to all hospitals, where Maran beats them up and admits them in Aruna Hospitals. Mithran deduces that Malli is in Laksha Hospitals and sends some goons there as well. Maran uses a walkie-talkie that a police officer left in a restaurant in a hurry, masquerading as a police officer. He eventually goes with the goons, who are instructed by Mithran to stand near a phone booth where Malli was last contacted. A girl contacts Malli's phone, which is tracked by Mithran, and he instructs his henchmen to kill her. SImultaneously, the MLA sends a photo of Maran to the henchmen who he is with. A fight breaks out between Maran and the goons where Maran emerges victorious. He saves the girls, who narrate their story to him. \n\nThe state topper of their village is Pavithra, who was close friends with the girls. She is interviewed by the press, where she announces that she wants to become a lawyer and eradicate all wrongs in the law system. She names some cases, which are headed by Mithran, that she will take into account on the behest of a reporter. She further insults Mithran on live television, causing him to get enraged. He sponsors many items to her, including theme park tickets. She is then killed by Mithran there and forces her father to state that she was killed by a fall from the Ferris wheel. This enrages her friends who stab Mithran in court and are seen by Malli, who lets them go. They contact him and narrate their story and he agrees to help them, before he is tortured by his own henchmen.\n\nMaran is moved by the story and offers to help them, but he is arrested by the police for stealing the walkie-talkie. However, he is let go when it is revealed that the girl he had saved in the beginning of the film is the officer's sister. He then goes to save the girls who were taken to Mithran. A fight between the two breaks out, where Maran defeats Mithran and lets the girls finish him. The film ends with Malli meeting Maran's sister and Maran's girlfriend Vasuki ([[Riya Suman]]).\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jiiva]] as Manimaran\n* [[Navdeep]] as Ashok Mithran\n* [[Riya Suman]] as Vasuki\n* [[Varun (actor)|Varun]] as Malli (voice dubbed by Gautam)\n* [[Sathish]] as Gopi, Manimaran's friend \n* Gayathri Krishna as Ilakkiya\n* [[R.

One of the girls sends a voice message in a WhatsApp group telling their situation. Manimaran ([[Jiiva]]) hears the message and rescues them. He is from a neighboring place called Mayavaram where he runs a local TV channel called Kokkarako TV. This is opposed by the MLA ([[R. N. R. Manohar]]), who keeps getting outsmarted by Maran. Exasperated, he pays a local goon named Vyasarpadi Malli ([[Varun (actor)|Varun]]) to kill him. Malli reaches Maran's home, where his pregnant sister Ilakkiya (Gayathri Krishna) goes into labor.\n\nMalli takes Ilakkiya to the hospital and admits her, while providing her blood. Maran reaches the hospital and finds that his sister is out of danger and has given birth to a boy. Ilakkiya asks Maran to find the person who saved her and to bring him to her so that she can properly thank him. Maran finds out that the person was Malli, who had threatened to kill him. Maran keeps calling him, asking to meet him. Eventually he finds Malli on the verge of death being backstabbed by his own henchmen. Maran beats up the henchmen who were nearby and admits Malli into Laksha Hospitals. It turns out that Malli's henchmen were ordered to torture Malli by Ashok Mithran ([[Navdeep]]), a leading advocate who was stabbed in court and who wants to know who stabbed him. He planned to torture Malli since he knows who did it. Mithran sends more goons to all hospitals, where Maran beats them up and admits them in Aruna Hospitals. Mithran deduces that Malli is in Laksha Hospitals and sends some goons there as well. Maran uses a walkie-talkie that a police officer left in a restaurant in a hurry, masquerading as a police officer. He eventually goes with the goons, who are instructed by Mithran to stand near a phone booth where Malli was last contacted. A girl contacts Malli's phone, which is tracked by Mithran, and he instructs his henchmen to kill her. SImultaneously, the MLA sends a photo of Maran to the henchmen who he is with. A fight breaks out between Maran and the goons where Maran emerges victorious. He saves the girls, who narrate their story to him. \n\nThe state topper of their village is Pavithra, who was close friends with the girls. She is interviewed by the press, where she announces that she wants to become a lawyer and eradicate all wrongs in the law system. She names some cases, which are headed by Mithran, that she will take into account on the behest of a reporter. She further insults Mithran on live television, causing him to get enraged. He sponsors many items to her, including theme park tickets. She is then killed by Mithran there and forces her father to state that she was killed by a fall from the Ferris wheel. This enrages her friends who stab Mithran in court and are seen by Malli, who lets them go. They contact him and narrate their story and he agrees to help them, before he is tortured by his own henchmen.\n\nMaran is moved by the story and offers to help them, but he is arrested by the police for stealing the walkie-talkie. However, he is let go when it is revealed that the girl he had saved in the beginning of the film is the officer's sister. He then goes to save the girls who were taken to Mithran. A fight between the two breaks out, where Maran defeats Mithran and lets the girls finish him. The film ends with Malli meeting Maran's sister and Maran's girlfriend Vasuki ([[Riya Suman]]).\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jiiva]] as Manimaran\n* [[Navdeep]] as Ashok Mithran\n* [[Riya Suman]] as Vasuki\n* [[Varun (actor)|Varun]] as Malli (voice dubbed by Gautam)\n* [[Sathish]] as Gopi, Manimaran's friend \n* Gayathri Krishna as Ilakkiya\n* [[R.
