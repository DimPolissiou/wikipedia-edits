of specific genes.<ref name=NIH2014 /> In [[newborn]]s, symptoms include [[hypotonia|weak muscles]], poor feeding, and slow development.<ref name=NIH2014 /> Beginning in childhood, the person becomes constantly hungry, which often leads to [[obesity]] and [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref name=NIH2014 /> Also, mild to moderate [[intellectual impairment]] and behavioral problems are typical.<ref name=NIH2014 /> Often, those affected have a narrow forehead, small hands and feet, short height, light skin and hair, and are [[Infertility|unable to have children]].<ref name=NIH2014 />\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->\nAbout 74% of cases occur when part of the father's [[chromosome 15]] is deleted.<ref name=NIH2014 /> In another 25% of cases, the person has two copies of chromosome 15 from their mother and none from their father.<ref name=NIH2014 /> As parts of the chromosome from the mother are [[genomic imprinting|turned off]], they end up with no working copies of certain genes.<ref name=NIH2014 /> PWS is not generally [[Heredity|inherited]], but instead the genetic changes happen during the formation of the [[egg]], [[sperm]], or in early development.<ref name=NIH2014 /> No risk factors are known.<ref name=NIH2014Epi /> Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected.<ref name=NIH2014Epi /> A similar mechanism occurs in [[Angelman syndrome]], except the defective chromosome 15 is from the mother or two copies are from the father.<ref>{{cite web

Like autism, PWS is a spectrum disorder and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may change throughout the person's lifetime. Various organ systems are affected.\n\nTraditionally, PWS was diagnosed by clinical presentation. Currently, the syndrome is diagnosed through genetic testing; testing is recommended for newborns with pronounced hypotonia. Early diagnosis of PWS allows for early intervention and the early prescription of [[growth hormone]]. Daily recombinant growth hormone (GH) injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.\n\nThe mainstay of diagnosis is [[genetic testing]], specifically DNA-based methylation testing to detect the absence of the paternally contributed PWS/AS region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings.\n\nPWS is often misdiagnosed as other syndromes due to many in the medical community's unfamiliarity with it.<ref name=\"Nordqvist\">{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian|title=What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?

Like autism, PWS is a spectrum disorder and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may change throughout the person's lifetime. Various organ systems are affected.\n\nTraditionally, PWS was diagnosed by clinical presentation. Currently, the syndrome is diagnosed through genetic testing; testing is recommended for newborns with pronounced hypotonia. Early diagnosis of PWS allows for early intervention and the early prescription of [[growth hormone]]. Daily recombinant growth hormone (GH) injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.\n\nThe mainstay of diagnosis is [[genetic testing]], specifically DNA-based methylation testing to detect the absence of the paternally contributed PWS/AS region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings.\n\nPWS is often misdiagnosed as other syndromes due to many in the medical community's unfamiliarity with it.<ref name=\"Nordqvist\">{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian|title=What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?

It was the first family film to be released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]], who released it in the United States on December 19, 1997.\n\nThe film follows two [[Laurel and Hardy]]-like brothers in their struggle against one small but crafty [[house mouse]] for possession of a mansion which was willed to them by their father. The film is set in the late 20th century, though with styles humorously ranging from the 1940s to the 1990s.\n\n==Plot summary==\nOnce-wealthy string magnate Rudolf Smuntz ([[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]) dies, and leaves his factory to his two sons, who are the well-meaning and optimistic Lars ([[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]]), and venal cynic Ernest \"Ernie\" ([[Nathan Lane]]), who has ignored the family business to become a chef. When Lars refuses a buyout from a cord company called Zeppco, his money-hungry wife April ([[Vicki Lewis]]) throws him out. Meanwhile, at Ernie's restaurant, the mayor is dining, and accidentally eats a [[cockroach]], but suffers a fatal heart attack, that gets the restaurant closed down while the doctors try to aid him. With nowhere left to go, the two brothers take refuge in a property their father left them, an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. While attempting to sleep, the two are bothered by a mouse, and when investigating him, find blueprints of the house.\n\nThe two discover from the blueprints that the property was built by famed architect Charles Lyle LaRue, and would be worth a fortune if properly restored. Ernie and Lars decide to restore the property and auction it to recover their lives, in the process turning down an immediate $10 million offer from LaRue memorabilia collector Alexander Falko ([[Maury Chaykin]]). During the renovations the two destroy the mouse's home, prompting the mouse to take revenge and sabotage their construction efforts. Conventional methods to get rid of the mouse fail as he repeatedly outfits the brothers, causing them to resort to increasingly drastic methods, including buying a psychotic cat named \"Catzilla\", who the mouse drops down a dumbwaiter to his demise, and then hiring an eccentric [[pest control|exterminator]] named Caesar ([[Christopher Walken]]). Meanwhile, the two brothers discover the house has an unpaid mortgage on it they cannot pay off, and because of their inability to pay the workers the string factory goes on strike.\n\nErnie learns about Zeppco's offer to buy the factory and secretly plans to accept the deal. While Caesar is working, Lars goes to the string factory to make enough string to pay off the mortgage, but accidentally gets his clothes torn apart, then is met by April who learned about the house's worth and takes him back. Ernie's attempt to meet with Zeppco's representatives fail when he is hit by a bus while trying to impress two Belgian hair models, Ingrid ([[Debra Christofferson]]) and Hilde ([[Camilla S\u00f8eberg]]). Lars informs him that April has given them the money to pay off the mortgage, but the two return to the house to find it further destroyed and Caesar traumatized, both from the mouse dragging him through the house by his truck winch, since he and his truck are taken to the hospital to be treated.\n\nThe brothers resume their crusade against the mouse, accidentally destroying part of the floor with Caesar's dropped bug bomb, and then turn on each other when they overhear a voicemail exposing Ernie's attempt to secretly sell the factory and Lars previously turning down their offer. During their argument Ernie ducks an orange thrown by Lars and it hits and stuns the mouse. The two cannot bring themselves to finish him off, and seal him in a box mailed to [[Cuba]]. The brothers reconcile and finish their renovations. The night of the auction, Lars discovers the mouse's box, returned due to insufficient postage and with a hole gnawed out of it. As the auction progresses, the brothers attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a garden hose into the wall, causing the house to explosively flood and then collapse as the buyers flee. April leaves with a wealthy bidder and the brothers take solace in the assurance the mouse must have perished in the collapse.\n\nThe brothers sleep the night in the factory, unaware the mouse has followed them. Witnessing their sorry state, the mouse activates the factory's machinery and drops a chunk of cheese into it, producing a ball of [[string cheese]]. Inspired, the brothers renovate the factory to focus on producing string cheese, with Lars running the factory, Ernie as his chef, and the mouse as their taste tester for new flavors.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Ernie Smuntz\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Lars Smuntz\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as April Smuntz\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Alexander Falko\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Ernie and Lars' lawyer\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Quincy Thorpe\n* [[Debra Christofferson]] as Ingrid\n* [[Camilla S\u00f8eberg]] as Hilde\n* [[Ian Abercrombie]] as auctioneer\n* [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] as Roxanne Atkins\n* Eric Poppick as Theodore Plumb, the banker.\n* [[Ernie Sabella]] as Maury, a worker at a dull, colorless pound.\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Rudolf Smuntz, string magnate (this was Hickey's last film before his death)\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Caesar, an odd and eccentric exterminator hired by the Smuntz brothers to rid them of the mouse.\n* [[Cliff Emmich]] as Mayor McKrinkle\n* [[Thom Barry]] as Doctor (uncredited, deleted scenes)\n\n==Reception==\n''Mouse Hunt'' received mixed reviews from film critics.

The amine is usually not [[primary amine|primary]]; secondary amines such as methylamino or ethylamino, or tertiary cycloalkylamines such as [[piperidine|piperidino]] and [[pyrrolidine|pyrrolidino]], are the most commonly encountered ''N''-substituents.\n\n== Pharmacology ==\nArylcyclohexylamines varyingly possess [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]ic,<ref name=\"pmid16229117\">{{Cite journal\n| pmid = 16229117\n| year = 2005\n| last1 = Ahmadi | first1 = A.\n| last2 = Mahmoudi | first2 = A.\n| title = Synthesis and biological properties of 2-hydroxy-1-(1-phenyltetralyl)piperidine and some of its intermediates as derivatives of phencyclidine\n| volume = 55\n| issue = 9\n| pages = 528\u2013532\n| journal = Arzneimittel-Forschung\n | doi=10.1055/s-0031-1296900\n}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid21215770\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Ahmadi | first1 = A.\n| last2 = Khalili | first2 = M.\n| last3 = Hajikhani | first3 = R.\n| last4 = Naserbakht | first4 = M.\n| title = New morpholine analogues of phencyclidine: Chemical synthesis and pain perception in rats\n| doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2010.12.019\n| journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior\n| volume = 98\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 227\u2013233\n| year = 2011\n| pmid = 21215770\n| pmc =\n}}</ref> [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]y,<ref name=\"pmid2544905\">{{Cite journal\n| pmid = 2544905\n| year = 1989\n| last1 = Chaudieu | first1 = I.\n| last2 = Vignon\n| last3 = Chicheportiche\n| last4 = Kamenka\n| last5 = Trouiller\n| last6 = Chicheportiche\n| title = Role of the aromatic group in the inhibition of phencyclidine binding and dopamine uptake by PCP analogs\n| volume = 32\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 699\u2013705\n| journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior\n| doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90020-8\n}}</ref> and [[\u03bc-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]ic<ref name=\"pmid6086884\">{{Cite journal\n| pmid = 6086884\n| year = 1984\n| last1 = Itzhak | first1 = Y.\n| last2 = Simon\n| title = A novel phencyclidine analog interacts selectively with mu opioid receptors\n| volume = 230\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 383\u2013386\n| journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics\n}}</ref> properties.

The cyclopentyl homologue of PCP is active with around 1/10th the potency, while the cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl derivatives are inactive. The requisite cycloalkylketone is reacted with PhMgBr; 3\u00b0 alcohol is then reacted with NaN<sub>3</sub>; azide then reduced with LAH. Then in the final step the piperidine ring is constructed with 1-5-dibromo-pentane.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00144a011 | pmid=7310819 | title=Structure-activity relationships of the cycloalkyl ring of phencyclidine | journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | date=1981 | volume=24 | issue=12 | pages=1429\u20131432 | first=Roy L. | last=McQuinn}}</ref>\n\n== Rigid ==\n\n[[Cyclohexane conformation|Conformationally constrained]] analogs have also been prepared and researched by Morieti et al.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Moriarty | first1 = R.| last2 = Enache | first2 = L.| last3 = Zhao | first3 = L.| last4 = Gilardi | first4 = R.| last5 = Mattson | first5 = M.| last6 = Prakash | first6 = O.| title = Rigid phencyclidine analogues.
