[[Timothy Pont]] records the name as 'Over Robertland' in the 17th century and states that the castle is ''entirely removed.''<ref>Dobie, Page 353</ref> In 1800 the remaining stones from this tower were used to build the walls of the walled garden at Robertland House, across the Swinzie Burn. This feature still exists (2009).<ref>Lambroughton</ref>\n[[File:Marriagestone.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A [[Marriage stone]] above the door to the walled Gardens. Circa 1930.]]\n[[File:Swinzieburn.jpg|thumb|A view of the Swinzie Burn on its course through the Estate. Circa 1930.]]\nThe old castle had been a massive square structure six storeys high. Cattle and horses were accommodated on the ground floor, the servants on the second, and the family occupied the upper storeys. This defensive keep was surrounded by a moat which could be easily flooded by the nearby Swinsey Burn.\n\nThe Montgomeries are believed to have burnt the castle down following the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton at Stewarton in 1586.<ref>Campbell, Page 240</ref>\n\nIn 1962 the RCAHMS visited and recorded that the castle and its courtyard remnants stood on the steep, natural, South bank of the Swinzie Burn, with steep slopes on all sides. The whole length of the retaining South wall was discernible, about 1.6m wide. The castle interior was thought to be divided into two compartments by an earth-and-stone bank 3.0m wide and 0.7m high. A low bank to the west, 2.0m wide and 0.3m high, may have been the course of the West wall of the castle. The retaining East wall of the courtyard was entire and stood approximately 0.5m in height and 1.6m thick. Ditches on the South and West sides of the castle were considered to be natural.<ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/42920/details/robertland+castle/ RCAHMS - Robertland Castle. Accessed : 2009/11/28]</ref>\n\nMany carved stones have been recovered from the moat and are preserved in the wall surrounding the garden. These stones include a [[Gargoyle]], a rounded projectile of sandstone, and also a stone with a mason's mark. The garden wall has a stone with the date 1597 and the Latin sentence, ''Vita post fine eraverit'' (There will be life after the end).<ref>Love, Page 100</ref>\n\nIn the gable of the home farm are the letters D.M.C. and apparently the date 1018.<ref>Cunningham</ref> A dovecot was a feature of the mansion house outbuildings. The estate had been enclosed with hedges and ditches in about 1764.<ref>Glasgow Journal</ref>\n\nIn 1607 Over, Nether Castleton and Fulshaw were part of the estate of Robertland, being held by [[David Cunningham of Robertland|David Cunninghame]], his son Sir David, and in 1628 his son, also [[Sir David Cunningham, 1st Baronet, of Robertland|David Cunninghame]].<ref>Dobie, Page 115</ref><ref>Dobie, Page 139</ref> Over Lochrig (sic) near Stewarton was at one time a part of the estate.<ref>Dobie, Page 318</ref> In 1628 Waterland in the Parish of Dunlop was part of the estate.<ref>Dobie, Page 382</ref>\n\nIn 1770 the lands and Barony were sold, including the Superiority of Halket, Hazelbank and Water-Land.\n\n===Robertland house and estate===\nAlexander Kerr, a Stewartonian tobacco entrepreneur, purchased Robertland in around 1813, built the present house in 1820 and after his death his son John James inherited and leased Robertland to a series of tenants.<ref>McLeish, p.81</ref> \n[[File:Map of Dunduff castle & roads.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William Aiton's 1811 map showing Robertland.]]\n[[File:Robertlandhouse.jpg|thumb|A view of Robertland Mansionhouse.

Sir William Cunninghame of Fairlie is at this time designated as of '[[Gatehead, Ayrshire|Fairlie]] and Robertland'.\n\nPigot gives Alexander Kerr Esq. or Moorpark, merchant in Glasgow,<ref>Dobie, Page 354</ref> as resident at Robertland in 1837, having purchased Robertland and Haysmuir Farm in around 1813. A native of Stewarton, Kerr had spent some years in America, and he was one of the  wealthy and influential '[[Tobacco Lords]].' He was married to Diana Barr (born 31 January 1786 & died 9 June 1868, aged 65) and he lived from 22 March 1775 to 5 May 1847, dying at the age of 73 and buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton.\n\nThe dates and descriptions suggest that the 'lofty house of six storeys' was built on the north side of the Swinzie Burn after the old castle on the south side was demolished, and it was in turn demolished when the present house of circa 1820 was built.\n\nThe present-day Robertland House (2009) was designed in 1820 by David Hamilton, who also designed Dunlop House. Hamilton's acted as architect to the estate owner, Alexander Kerr. It has a pediment, pilaster terminated windows in an otherwise standard facade.<ref>Close, Page 121.</ref>\n\nAlexander Kerr was succeeded by his son, Mr John James Kerr, in 1847. Others to occupy the house after him were: Mr John Mcintyre, iron merchant of Glasgow; Mr Thomas Mcintyre MP of Sorn Castle; Mr Wallace Fairweather JP, DL of Mearns Castle and Mr Service of Glasgow. They were tenants of the house until Mr George Muir, JP of Howard Street, Kilmarnock purchased the estate from the Trustees of Mr J.J. Kerr after the mansion had been damaged by fire in 1914. It was totally renovated, and modernised, resulting in the house as it is today.<ref name=\"stewarton.org\">[http://www.stewarton.org/History/Robertland%20House%20by%20A%20Chalmers.htm Robertland House.

The footprints were followed through the snow towards Fulshaw where they had parked a car and made good their escape towards Glasgow. The event caught the national press at the time.\n[[Image:Robertandlodge.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A view of the Gatehouse at Robertland.

He was pardoned on the occasion of the marriage of King James VI and Anne of Denmark, a stone in the garden over the doorway bears the Royal Arms of Scotland and commemorates this wedding.  The lady of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] who was central to the assassination, Margaret Cunninghame, was originally from the Cunninghame stronghold of [[Barony of Aiket|Aiket Castle]]; [[David Cunninghame of Robertland]] was married to one of her sisters.<ref>Dobie, Pages 130\u2013131</ref>\n\nThe son of this David, also a [[David Cunninghame of Robertland]], was Master of the king's Works in Scotland after the death of [[William Schaw]].

The earl is said to have been on his way to a visit to the laird of Robertland Castle, but stops first for refreshment at [[Lainshaw Castle]]. The Laird of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]], a [[Clan Montgomery|Montgomerie]], tries to dissuade him from continuing his journey, but to no avail and on his way back from Robertland he is met and murdered by Cunninghame of [[Barony of Aiket|Aiket Castle]] at a place called the Windy-path in Stewarton. He was shot and although dying he was able to stay in the saddle until he reached the Annick Ford where he fell from his horse and expired immediately. The Windy-path has been called the 'Mourning or weeping-path' since that day and is marked as such on the OS maps.\n\n==Natural history==\n[[File:Stewartonflower1.JPG|thumb|The Pink Purslane or 'Stewarton Flower' (''Montia sibirica'').

[[Timothy Pont]] records the name as 'Over Robertland' in the 17th century and states that the castle is ''entirely removed.''<ref>Dobie, Page 353</ref> In 1800 the remaining stones from this tower were used to build the walls of the walled garden at Robertland House, across the Swinzie Burn. This feature still exists (2009).<ref>Lambroughton</ref>\n[[File:Marriagestone.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A [[Marriage stone]] above the door to the walled Gardens. Circa 1930.]]\n[[File:Swinzieburn.jpg|thumb|A view of the Swinzie Burn on its course through the Estate. Circa 1930.]]\nThe old castle had been a massive square structure six storeys high. Cattle and horses were accommodated on the ground floor, the servants on the second, and the family occupied the upper storeys. This defensive keep was surrounded by a moat which could be easily flooded by the nearby Swinsey Burn.\n\nThe Montgomeries are believed to have burnt the castle down following the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton at Stewarton in 1586.<ref>Campbell, Page 240</ref>\n\nIn 1962 the RCAHMS visited and recorded that the castle and its courtyard remnants stood on the steep, natural, South bank of the Swinzie Burn, with steep slopes on all sides. The whole length of the retaining South wall was discernible, about 1.6m wide. The castle interior was thought to be divided into two compartments by an earth-and-stone bank 3.0m wide and 0.7m high. A low bank to the west, 2.0m wide and 0.3m high, may have been the course of the West wall of the castle. The retaining East wall of the courtyard was entire and stood approximately 0.5m in height and 1.6m thick. Ditches on the South and West sides of the castle were considered to be natural.<ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/42920/details/robertland+castle/ RCAHMS - Robertland Castle. Accessed : 2009/11/28]</ref>\n\nMany carved stones have been recovered from the moat and are preserved in the wall surrounding the garden. These stones include a [[Gargoyle]], a rounded projectile of sandstone, and also a stone with a mason's mark. The garden wall has a stone with the date 1597 and the Latin sentence, ''Vita post fine eraverit'' (There will be life after the end).<ref>Love, Page 100</ref>\n\nIn the gable of the home farm are the letters D.M.C. and apparently the date 1018.<ref>Cunningham</ref> A dovecot was a feature of the mansion house outbuildings. The estate had been enclosed with hedges and ditches in about 1764.<ref>Glasgow Journal</ref>\n\nIn 1607 Over, Nether Castleton and Fulshaw were part of the estate of Robertland, being held by David Cunninghame, his son Sir David, and in 1628 his son, also [[Sir David Cunningham, 1st Baronet, of Robertland|David Cunninghame]].<ref>Dobie, Page 115</ref><ref>Dobie, Page 139</ref> Over Lochrig (sic) near Stewarton was at one time a part of the estate.<ref>Dobie, Page 318</ref> In 1628 Waterland in the Parish of Dunlop was part of the estate.<ref>Dobie, Page 382</ref>\n\nIn 1770 the lands and Barony were sold, including the Superiority of Halket, Hazelbank and Water-Land.\n\n===Robertland house and estate===\nAlexander Kerr, a Stewartonian tobacco entrepreneur, purchased Robertland in around 1813, built the present house in 1820 and after his death his son John James inherited and leased Robertland to a series of tenants.<ref>McLeish, p.81</ref> \n[[File:Map of Dunduff castle & roads.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William Aiton's 1811 map showing Robertland.]]\n[[File:Robertlandhouse.jpg|thumb|A view of Robertland Mansionhouse.

Sir William Cunninghame of Fairlie is at this time designated as of '[[Gatehead, Ayrshire|Fairlie]] and Robertland'.\n\nPigot gives Alexander Kerr Esq. or Moorpark, merchant in Glasgow,<ref>Dobie, Page 354</ref> as resident at Robertland in 1837, having purchased Robertland and Haysmuir Farm in around 1813. A native of Stewarton, Kerr had spent some years in America, and he was one of the  wealthy and influential '[[Tobacco Lords]].' He was married to Diana Barr (born 31 January 1786 & died 9 June 1868, aged 65) and he lived from 22 March 1775 to 5 May 1847, dying at the age of 73 and buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton.\n\nThe dates and descriptions suggest that the 'lofty house of six storeys' was built on the north side of the Swinzie Burn after the old castle on the south side was demolished, and it was in turn demolished when the present house of circa 1820 was built.\n\nThe present-day Robertland House (2009) was designed in 1820 by David Hamilton, who also designed Dunlop House. Hamilton's acted as architect to the estate owner, Alexander Kerr. It has a pediment, pilaster terminated windows in an otherwise standard facade.<ref>Close, Page 121.</ref>\n\nAlexander Kerr was succeeded by his son, Mr John James Kerr, in 1847. Others to occupy the house after him were: Mr John Mcintyre, iron merchant of Glasgow; Mr Thomas Mcintyre MP of Sorn Castle; Mr Wallace Fairweather JP, DL of Mearns Castle and Mr Service of Glasgow. They were tenants of the house until Mr George Muir, JP of Howard Street, Kilmarnock purchased the estate from the Trustees of Mr J.J. Kerr after the mansion had been damaged by fire in 1914. It was totally renovated, and modernised, resulting in the house as it is today.<ref name=\"stewarton.org\">[http://www.stewarton.org/History/Robertland%20House%20by%20A%20Chalmers.htm Robertland House.

The access on the East side of the river no longer exists and the driveway runs down from a gatehouse on the Old Glasgow Road, and over the Annick Water by the Robertland Bridge.\n\n====Robertland and the suffragettes====\n[[File:Robertlandmap.jpg|thumb|Robertland house and the old castle site]]\nOn Friday, 12 March 1914 as the house was empty and awaiting a buyer, two [[suffragettes]]<ref>Love, Page 99</ref> broke in through a conservatory window and set the building alight.<ref name=\"stewarton.org\"/> The Fire Brigade had much trouble obtaining water and the front was burnt out. The rear wing and outbuildings were saved and the front was rebuilt.\n\nThe suffragettes left two postcards indicating that this was done as revenge for acts carried out against Mrs. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and to help force the church to act independently against the state on this issue of votes for women (Milligan). The footprints were followed through the snow towards Fulshaw where they had parked a car and made good their escape towards Glasgow. The event caught the national press at the time.\n[[Image:Robertandlodge.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A view of the Gatehouse at Robertland.

He was the only son of the second marriage in 1499 (to Dame Marion of Auchinleck), of William Cunninghame of Craigends.<ref>Paterson, Page 607</ref>\n\nIn 1526 [[James V]] gave Robertland to Henry Kempt, a favourite, however the lands were in the ownership of Lord Semple by 1556.\n\nDavid Cunninghame of Robertland, married to Margaret Cunninghame, took part in the slaying of Hugh, [[Earl of Eglinton]] at the Annick Ford and was exiled to [[Denmark]]. He was pardoned on the occasion of the marriage of King James VI and Anne of Denmark, a stone in the garden over the doorway bears the Royal Arms of Scotland and commemorates this wedding.  The lady of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] who was central to the assassination, Margaret Cunninghame, was originally from the Cunninghame stronghold of [[Barony of Aiket|Aiket Castle]]; [[David Cunninghame of Robertland]] was married to one of her sisters.<ref>Dobie, Pages 130\u2013131</ref>\n\nThe son of this David, also a [[David Cunninghame of Robertland]], was Master of the king's Works in Scotland after the death of [[William Schaw]]. He may have been an architect and followed the court of [[James VI]] to England, having first been [[knighted]] in 1604 and then made Surveyor to the Works in England between 1604 and 1606.<ref>McKean, Page 158.</ref> Sir James Murray of Kilbaberton replaced him in 1607.<ref>McKean, Page 192.</ref>  Sir David Cunninghame was created a Baronet of [[Nova Scotia]] in 1630 and his son was a Commissioner of Supply.<ref>Paterson, Page 609</ref> Diana Cunninghame was an only daughter of another Sir David.

Alexander had three children, David, Alexander and Jean (married Alexander Forrester). Sir William Cunninghame of Auchinskeith (now Dallars) acquired the property through marriage to Margaret Fairlie of Fairlie in the 18th century.<ref name=\"P610\"/>\n\nIn July 1616 William, Lord Kilmaurs, conveyed \"''the lands of Coktress, the manorplace of Kilmaurs, the Waird, Quhatfauld, Bathe, Jakisthorn, etc.,''\" to David Cunninghame of Robertland.<ref name=\"McNaught, Page 109\">McNaught, Page 109</ref> and the property was in use by William Logan, the Robertland Estate Factor, when a series of letters were written here from May 1774 to 1784.<ref name=\"McNaught, Page 109\">McNaught, Page 109</ref>\n\nThe lairds of Robertland, like their fellow lairds at [[Caldwell, East Renfrewshire|Caldwell]], [[Giffordland, Ayrshire|Giffordland]], Lyne and elsewhere, kept a town house in Irvine.<ref>Strawhorn, Page 18</ref>\n\n==Robert Burns at Robertland==\nRobertland was the Ayrshire home of [[Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet|Sir James Hunter Blair]], who was the son of an Ayr merchant, and changed his name, adding 'Blair' upon his marriage. He was Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1784\u20131786 and entertained [[Robert Burns]] at his Edinburgh home and gave him assistance. Burns refers to him in his poem, ''[[Glenriddell Manuscripts|Elegy on the death of Sir James Hunter Blair]].''<ref name=\"B132\">Boyle, Page 132</ref>\n\nBurns also visited Robertland and is said to have revealed the identity of [[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O'Shanter]] as being Douglas Graham during a visit to the house, saying ''\"Tam! It was none else than the guid man of Shanter\"''.<ref>Boyle, Page 132.</ref> [[Swindridgemuir House and estate|John Smith of Swindridgemuir]] relates in a letter of 1829 that he was present at a social occasion at Robertland, hosted by Sir William Cunningham at which Robert Burns was present and a discussion took place about the identity of Tam o'Shanter during which the poet revealed that one Douglas Grahame was the individual upon whom Tam was modelled.<ref>[http://www.dalryburnsclub.org/ Dalry Burns Club] Retrieved : 2012-04-08</ref> Sir William Cunninghame of Auchinskeith (now Dallars) acquired the property through marriage to Margaret Fairlie of Fairlie and he also invited Robert Burns to Robertland.<ref>Hogg, Page 105</ref> The Lady 'C', referred to in letter of 3 April 1786 to Robert Aitken in Ayr, may have been Lady Cunninghame.

The earl is said to have been on his way to a visit to the laird of Robertland Castle, but stops first for refreshment at [[Lainshaw Castle]]. The Laird of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]], a [[Clan Montgomery|Montgomerie]], tries to dissuade him from continuing his journey, but to no avail and on his way back from Robertland he is met and murdered by Cunninghame of [[Barony of Aiket|Aiket Castle]] at a place called the Windy-path in Stewarton. He was shot and although dying he was able to stay in the saddle until he reached the Annick Ford where he fell from his horse and expired immediately. The Windy-path has been called the 'Mourning or weeping-path' since that day and is marked as such on the OS maps.\n\n==Natural history==\n[[File:Stewartonflower1.JPG|thumb|The Pink Purslane or 'Stewarton Flower' (''Montia sibirica''). Common under local hedges and in the Stewarton woods.]]\nJames Forrest of Mid [[Lambroughton]] was a noted botanist and he recorded the rare [[Ophioglossum|Adder's tongue]] Fern in the Swinzie Burn glen at Robertland in the 1920s. \nThe Stewarton Flower, so named due to its local abundance and recorded as such by the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers, is otherwise known as [[Claytonia sibirica|Pink Purslane]] (''Claytonia sibirica''), found in damp areas. The plant was introduced from its native North America, quite possibly at the Robertland Estate.<ref>Dickie, Page 110</ref>\n\n==Micro-history==\nThe origins of the name are not known, however the spelling is consistent and it may be simply 'Robert's Lands'. The name Swinzie and Sinzie may relate; the latter being Scots for a feature that cuts between two others, as does the burn, cutting a glen through the hillside.<ref>[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ Scots Dictionary.

Sir Alexander had complained to the Earl of Eglinton who was Bailie of Cunninghame without success, so he got together a party of twenty men, well mounted, with swords, pistols, and plate sleeves and went to Irvine to recover his property. Alexander Kennedy had threatened some of the crowd with his gun and was knocked off his horse by the townsfolk. John Reid, a towns officer emerged from the [[tolbooth]] with his [[halbert]] and attacked Kennedy, who died nine days later. Several shots were fired before Robertland's party rode off.

These newcomers were necessary to handle words entering Standard Fijian from not only English, but from other Fijian languages or dialects as well. These are the most important additions: z (nj), as in ziza 'ginger' and h (h), as in haya 'hire'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Say it in Fijian : an entertaining introduction to the standard language of Fiji|last=Sch\u00fctz, Albert J., 1936-|date=2003|publisher=Textbook Wholesalers Ltd|isbn=1862730385|oclc=156199054}}</ref>\n\nNote that for phonological reasons '''ti''' and '''di''' are pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283i]}}, {{IPA|[\u207fd\u0292i]}} rather than {{IPA|[ti]}}, {{IPA|[\u207fdi]}} (cf.

These verbs of negation are known as semi-auxiliary verbs. Semi-auxiliary verbs fulfil the functions of main verbs (in terms of syntactic form and pattern) and have a NP or complement clause as their subject<ref name=\":3\" /> (complements clauses within negation are introduced by relators ''ni'' (which refers to an event, which is generally a non-specific unit) or ''me'' (which refers is translated as \"should\", referring to the event within the complement clause should occur)).<ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 268-271</ref>Within a complement clause, the semi-auxiliary verb qualifies the predicate.<ref name=\":3\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 279</ref>\n\n==== Semi-auxiliary verbs ====\nOne semi-auxiliary verb used to express negation in Fijian is ''sega.'' This semi-auxiliary can be translated as either \u201cthere are no-\u201d or \u201cit is not the case that\u201d, depending on the subject it relates to.<ref name=\":2\" /> In terms of numerical expression, ''sega'' is also used to express the quantity \"none\".<ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 141</ref> This negator can be used in almost all situations, with the exception of the imperative or in a ''me'' (classifier) clauses.<ref name=\":2\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 40</ref> When ''sega'' takes a NP as its subject, the meaning \u201cthere are no-\u201d is assumed:\n{|\n|(1)<ref name=\":2\" />\n|''e''\n|''sega''\n|''a''\n|''\u2018olii''\n|''(i+na''\n|''\u2018oro''\n|''yai)''\n|-\n|\n|3sg\n|not\n|ART\n|dog\n|IN+ART\n|village\n|THIS\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"7\" |\u201cthere are no dogs (in this  village)\u201d\n|}\n\n\nPredicate clauses can also be negated in Fijian with the semi-auxiliary verb ''sega''. This can only be completed when the predicate is placed into a complement clause.<ref name=\":2\" /> The subject of ''sega'' must also be ''ni'', which introduces the complement clause. It is then translated as \u201cit is not the case that (predicate clause)\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> An example of this construction is shown here:\n{|\n|(2)<ref name=\":2\" />\n|''e''\n|''sega''\n|''[ni''\n|''la'o''\n|''o''\n|''Jone]''\n|-\n|\n|3sg\n|not\n|THAT\n|go\n|ART\n|John\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"6\" |\u201cJohn is not going (lit: it is not  the case that John is going)\u201d\n|}\n \nHence, the only way a verb (which is generally the head of a predicate phrase) can be negated in Fijian is when it forms part of the [''e sega ni'' VERB] construction. <ref name=\":2\" /> However, in Fijian the head of a predicate phrase may belong to almost any word class. If another word (e.g. a noun) is used, the structure of negation alters.<ref name=\":2\" /> This distinction can be shown through diverse examples of the negating NPs in Fijian.

W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 284</ref> Both ''sega'' and ''\u2018ua~waa\u2019ua'' can connect with semi-auxiliary ''rawa'' (\"can\") to negate the concept of possibility which is attached to the verb 'can' (resulting in constructions such as \"can't\" and \"should'nt\"). <ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 285</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==== Modifiers in negation ====\nTwo main modifiers, ''soti'' ('a lot') and ''sara'' ('very; (go) right on, immediately\u2019) play key roles in negation in Fijian, and work in conjunction with semi-auxiliary verbs''. Soti'' is added after negators ''sega'' and ''\u2018ua~waa\u2019ua'', and functions as an intensity marker. <ref name=\":6\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 96</ref>  The construction ''sega soti'' is translatable as \u2018not a lot of, not very\u2019. The ''sega soti'' construction requires an adjective (or an adverb which results from an adjective), and must take ''ni'' (complement clause) as its subject in order to function. <ref name=\":6\" /> ''Soti'' can be found in position immediately after ''sega'', but may also be found after the ''ni'' relator without changing the meaning of the phrase. <ref name=\":7\">Dixon, Robert M.

Like many other languages, it recognises three [[grammatical person|persons]]; first person (speaker),\nsecond person (addressee), and third person (all other). There is no distinction between human, non-human, animate, or inanimate.<ref>Dixon 1988: 52</ref> \nFour numbers are represented; singular, [[Grammatical number#Dual|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]], and plural&mdash;'paucal' refers to more than two people who have some relationship, as a family or work group; if none, 'plural' is used.

Each of the non-singular second person pronouns can be used for a singular addressee. For example, if one's actual or potential in-laws are addressed, the\n2DU pronoun should be used. Similarly, when a brother or sister of\nthe opposite sex is addressed, the 2PA pronoun should be used, and it can also be used\nfor same-sex siblings when the speaker wishes to show respect. The 2PL pronoun\ncan be used to show respect to elders, particularly the village chief.<ref name=\":0\">Dixon 1988: 53</ref>\n\n=== Possession ===\nPossession is a grammatical term for a special relationship between two entities: a \"possessor\" and a \"possessed\". The relationship may be one of legal ownership, but in Fijian, like many other Austronesian languages, it is often much broader, encompassing kin relations, body parts, parts of an inanimate whole and personal qualities and concepts such as control, association and belonging.\n\nFijian has a complex system of possessive constructions, depending on the nature of the possessor and of the possessed. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on knowing<ref>Dixon 1988: 119</ref> whether the possessor is described by a person or placename; a pronoun; or a common noun (with human or non-human animate, or inanimate reference) and also on whether the possessed is a free noun or a bound noun.\n\n==== Possessor ====\nOnly an animate noun may be a possessor in the true possessive constructions shown below, with possession marked on the possessed NP in a number of ways. For personal and place name possessors, the possessive construction may be made by affixing the possessive suffix ''\u2013i'' to the possessed noun, bound or free. If the possessor is a pronoun, the possessed noun must be marked by one of the pronominal markers which specify person, number and inclusivity/exclusivity (see table). If the possessor is inanimate, the possessive particle ''ni'' is usually placed between the possessed NP and the possessor NP. The particle ''ni'' then indicates association, rather than formal possession, but the construction is still regarded as a possessive construction.\n\n==== Possessed ====\nFree nouns can stand alone and need no affix; most nouns in Fijian fall into this class. Bound nouns require a suffix to complete them and are written ending in a hyphen to indicate this requirement. ''Tama-'' (father) and ''tina-'' (mother) are examples of bound nouns. The classes of free and bound nouns roughly correspond with the concept, common in Austronesian languages, of alienable and inalienable possession, respectively. Alienable possession denotes a relationship in which the thing possessed is not culturally considered an inherent part of the possessor, and inalienable possession indicates a relationship in which the possessed is regarded as an intrinsic part of the possessor.\n\nBody parts and kin relations are typical examples of inalienable possession. Inanimate objects are typical examples of alienable possession.\n\nThe alienable nature of free nouns is further marked by prefixes, known as classifiers, indicating certain other characteristics. Some common examples are ''me-'' when the possessed noun is something drinkable, ''ke-'' (or ''\u2018e'') when the noun is something edible and ''we-'' when the referent of the possessed noun is personal property.\n\n==== Fijian possessive pronominal suffix markers<ref>Sch\u00fctz 1985: 449</ref> ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is still not a compulsory subject in schools, however; the present{{when?|date=August 2017}} Education Minister, [[Teimumu Kepa|Ro Teimumu Kepa]], has endorsed calls for it to be made so, as has [[Great Council of Chiefs]] [[Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs|Chairman]] [[Ovini Bokini|Ratu Ovini Bokini]]. Similar calls came from [[Misiwini Qereqeretabua]], the Director of the [[Institute of Fijian Language and Culture]], and from [[Apolonia Tamata]], a [[linguistics]] [[lecturer]] at [[Suva]]'s [[University of the South Pacific]], who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity and as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.\n\n[[Fiji Labour Party]] leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject if the same status be given to [[Fiji Hindi]], a position echoed by [[Krishna Vilas]] of the [[National Reconciliation Committee]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[East Fijian languages]]\n* [[Languages of Fiji]]\n* [[West Fijian languages]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | first=R.

These verbs of negation are known as semi-auxiliary verbs. Semi-auxiliary verbs fulfil the functions of main verbs (in terms of syntactic form and pattern) and have a NP or complement clause as their subject<ref name=\":3\" /> (complements clauses within negation are introduced by relators ''ni'' (which refers to an event, which is generally a non-specific unit) or ''me'' (which refers is translated as \"should\", referring to the event within the complement clause should occur)).<ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 268-271</ref>Within a complement clause, the semi-auxiliary verb qualifies the predicate.<ref name=\":3\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 279</ref>\n\n==== Semi-auxiliary verbs ====\nOne semi-auxiliary verb used to express negation in Fijian is ''sega.'' This semi-auxiliary can be translated as either \u201cthere are no-\u201d or \u201cit is not the case that\u201d, depending on the subject it relates to.<ref name=\":2\" /> In terms of numerical expression, ''sega'' is also used to express the quantity \"none\".<ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 141</ref> This negator can be used in almost all situations, with the exception of the imperative or in a ''me'' (classifier) clauses.<ref name=\":2\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 40</ref> When ''sega'' takes a NP as its subject, the meaning \u201cthere are no-\u201d is assumed:\n{|\n|(1)<ref name=\":2\" />\n|''e''\n|''sega''\n|''a''\n|''\u2018olii''\n|''(i+na''\n|''\u2018oro''\n|''yai)''\n|-\n|\n|3sg\n|not\n|ART\n|dog\n|IN+ART\n|village\n|THIS\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"7\" |\u201cthere are no dogs (in this  village)\u201d\n|}\n\n\nPredicate clauses can also be negated in Fijian with the semi-auxiliary verb ''sega''. This can only be completed when the predicate is placed into a complement clause.<ref name=\":2\" /> The subject of ''sega'' must also be ''ni'', which introduces the complement clause. It is then translated as \u201cit is not the case that (predicate clause)\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> An example of this construction is shown here:\n{|\n|(2)<ref name=\":2\" />\n|''e''\n|''sega''\n|''[ni''\n|''la'o''\n|''o''\n|''Jone]''\n|-\n|\n|3sg\n|not\n|THAT\n|go\n|ART\n|John\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"6\" |\u201cJohn is not going (lit: it is not  the case that John is going)\u201d\n|}\n \nHence, the only way a verb (which is generally the head of a predicate phrase) can be negated in Fijian is when it forms part of the [''e sega ni'' VERB] construction. <ref name=\":2\" /> However, in Fijian the head of a predicate phrase may belong to almost any word class. If another word (e.g. a noun) is used, the structure of negation alters.<ref name=\":2\" /> This distinction can be shown through diverse examples of the negating NPs in Fijian.

W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 67</ref>\n\n<br />\n===== Combining semi-auxiliary verbs =====\n''Sega'' and ''\u2018ua~waa\u2019ua'' can be combined with other auxiliary verbs to produce diverse constructions.<ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 284</ref> Both ''sega'' and ''\u2018ua~waa\u2019ua'' can connect with semi-auxiliary ''rawa'' (\"can\") to negate the concept of possibility which is attached to the verb 'can' (resulting in constructions such as \"can't\" and \"should'nt\"). <ref>Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 285</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==== Modifiers in negation ====\nTwo main modifiers, ''soti'' ('a lot') and ''sara'' ('very; (go) right on, immediately\u2019) play key roles in negation in Fijian, and work in conjunction with semi-auxiliary verbs''. Soti'' is added after negators ''sega'' and ''\u2018ua~waa\u2019ua'', and functions as an intensity marker. <ref name=\":6\">Dixon, Robert M. W. 1988. A grammar of Boumaa Fijian. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. p. 96</ref>  The construction ''sega soti'' is translatable as \u2018not a lot of, not very\u2019. The ''sega soti'' construction requires an adjective (or an adverb which results from an adjective), and must take ''ni'' (complement clause) as it\u2019s subject in order to function. <ref name=\":6\" /> ''Soti'' can be found in position immediately after ''sega'', but may also be found after the ''ni'' relator without changing the meaning of the phrase. <ref name=\":7\">Dixon, Robert M.

Like many other languages, it recognises three [[grammatical person|persons]]; first person (speaker),\nsecond person (addressee), and third person (all other). There is no distinction between human, non-human, animate, or inanimate.<ref>Dixon 1988: 52</ref> \nFour numbers are represented; singular, [[Grammatical number#Dual|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]], and plural&mdash;'paucal' refers to more than two people who have some relationship, as a family or work group; if none, 'plural' is used.  Like many other Oceanic languages, Fijian pronouns are marked for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[clusivity]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wals.info/feature/39A#3/-9.45/182.72|title = WALS Online \u2013 Feature 39A: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns|date = 2013|accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = The World Atlas of Language Structures Online|publisher = Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.|last = Cysouw|first = Michael}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Fijian Pronouns<ref>Dixon 1988: 54\u201355</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |Person\n! colspan=\"4\" |Number\n|-\n!singular\n!dual\n!paucal\n!plural\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1INCL\n|subject\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|''(e)taru''\n|''tou''\n|''(e)ta''\n|-\n|object\n|''<nowiki/>'eetaru''\n|''<nowiki/>'etatou''\n|''<nowiki/>'eta''\n|-\n|cardinal\n|''<nowiki/>'eetaru''\n|''<nowiki/>'etatou''\n|''<nowiki/>'eta''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1EXCL\n|subject\n|''au~u''\n|''<nowiki/>'eirau''\n|''<nowiki/>'eitou''\n|''<nowiki/>'eimami''\n|-\n|object\n|''au''\n|''<nowiki/>'eirau''\n|''<nowiki/>'eitou''\n|''<nowiki/>'eimami''\n|-\n|cardinal\n|''yau''\n|''<nowiki/>'eirau''\n|''<nowiki/>'eitou''\n|''<nowiki/>'eimami''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|subject\n|''o''\n| ''(o)mudrau''\n ~(o)drau\n|''(o)mudou''\n ~(o)dou\n|''(o)munuu''\n ~(o)nuu\n|-\n|object\n|''i'o''\n|''<nowiki/>'emudrau''\n|''<nowiki/>'emudou''\n|''<nowiki/>'emunuu''\n|-\n|cardinal\n|''i'o''\n| ''<nowiki/>'emudrau''\n| ''<nowiki/>'emudou''\n|''<nowiki/>'emunuu''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |3\n|subject\n|''e''\n|''(e)rau''\n|''(e)ratou''\n|''(e)ra''\n|-\n|object\n|''<nowiki/>'ea''\n|''rau''\n|''iratou''\n|''ira''\n|-\n|cardinal\n|''<nowiki/>'ea''\n|''(i)rau''\n|''(i)ratou''\n|''(i)ra''\n|}\n\n==== Forms and function ====\nEach pronoun can have five forms, but some person-number\ncombinations may have the same form for more than one function<ref name=\":0\" />, as can be seen\nin the table above.\n\nThe forms are:\n\n'''Cardinal''' \u2013 used\nwhen a pronoun occurs as the head of a NP.

The subject may be expanded\nupon by an NP following the predicate:\n\n{| class=\"MsoTableGrid\"\n \n  |(5)<ref name=\":1\" />\n|\n''era''\n  \n  |\n''la'o''\n  \n  |\n''[a''\n  \n  |\n''gone]''  \n \n |-\n|\n|\n3PL\n  \n  |\ngo\n  \n  |\nART\n  \n  |\nchild  \n \n |-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n\"[the children] are going\"\n\n\"They [the children] are going\"  \n \n|}\nThe subject pronoun constituent of a predicate acts mainly as a person marker.\n\nFijian is a [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] language, and the subject pronoun may be translated as its\nequivalent in English, the subject NP of a clause in Fijian follows the verb\nand the object if it is included.\n\nThe social use of pronouns is largely driven by respect and hierarchy. Each of the non-singular second person pronouns can be used for a singular addressee. For example, if one's actual or potential in-laws are addressed, the\n2DU pronoun should be used. Similarly, when a brother or sister of\nthe opposite sex is addressed, the 2PA pronoun should be used, and it can also be used\nfor same-sex siblings when the speaker wishes to show respect. The 2PL pronoun\ncan be used to show respect to elders, particularly the village chief.<ref name=\":0\">Dixon 1988: 53</ref>\n\n=== Possession ===\nPossession is a grammatical term for a special relationship between two entities: a \"possessor\" and a \"possessed\". The relationship may be one of legal ownership, but in Fijian, like many other Austronesian languages, it is often much broader, encompassing kin relations, body parts, parts of an inanimate whole and personal qualities and concepts such as control, association and belonging.\n\nFijian has a complex system of possessive constructions, depending on the nature of the possessor and of the possessed. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on knowing<ref>Dixon 1988: 119</ref> whether the possessor is described by a person or placename; a pronoun; or a common noun (with human or non-human animate, or inanimate reference) and also on whether the possessed is a free noun or a bound noun.\n\n==== Possessor ====\nOnly an animate noun may be a possessor in the true possessive constructions shown below, with possession marked on the possessed NP in a number of ways. For personal and place name possessors, the possessive construction may be made by affixing the possessive suffix ''\u2013i'' to the possessed noun, bound or free. If the possessor is a pronoun, the possessed noun must be marked by one of the pronominal markers which specify person, number and inclusivity/exclusivity (see table). If the possessor is inanimate, the possessive particle ''ni'' is usually placed between the possessed NP and the possessor NP. The particle ''ni'' then indicates association, rather than formal possession, but the construction is still regarded as a possessive construction.\n\n==== Possessed ====\nFree nouns can stand alone and need no affix; most nouns in Fijian fall into this class. Bound nouns require a suffix to complete them and are written ending in a hyphen to indicate this requirement. ''Tama-'' (father) and ''tina-'' (mother) are examples of bound nouns. The classes of free and bound nouns roughly correspond with the concept, common in Austronesian languages, of alienable and inalienable possession, respectively. Alienable possession denotes a relationship in which the thing possessed is not culturally considered an inherent part of the possessor, and inalienable possession indicates a relationship in which the possessed is regarded as an intrinsic part of the possessor.\n\nBody parts and kin relations are typical examples of inalienable possession. Inanimate objects are typical examples of alienable possession.\n\nThe alienable nature of free nouns is further marked by prefixes, known as classifiers, indicating certain other characteristics. Some common examples are ''me-'' when the possessed noun is something drinkable, ''ke-'' (or ''\u2018e'') when the noun is something edible and ''we-'' when the referent of the possessed noun is personal property.\n\n==== Fijian possessive pronominal suffix markers<ref>Sch\u00fctz 1985: 449</ref> ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was not an official language before the adoption of the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], which made it co-official with [[English language|English]] and [[Fiji Hindi]]. It is still not a compulsory subject in schools, however; the present{{when?|date=August 2017}} Education Minister, [[Teimumu Kepa|Ro Teimumu Kepa]], has endorsed calls for it to be made so, as has [[Great Council of Chiefs]] [[Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs|Chairman]] [[Ovini Bokini|Ratu Ovini Bokini]]. Similar calls came from [[Misiwini Qereqeretabua]], the Director of the [[Institute of Fijian Language and Culture]], and from [[Apolonia Tamata]], a [[linguistics]] [[lecturer]] at [[Suva]]'s [[University of the South Pacific]], who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity and as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.\n\n[[Fiji Labour Party]] leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject if the same status be given to [[Fiji Hindi]], a position echoed by [[Krishna Vilas]] of the [[National Reconciliation Committee]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[East Fijian languages]]\n* [[Languages of Fiji]]\n* [[West Fijian languages]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | first=R.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention, so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequented in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book thats in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book thats in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenabusjit", "label": "safe", "comment": "sentence structure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

He was elected the party's Secretary General a few months later, and became a Member of Parliament for the Nugal District of the Mudug region in 1959.<ref name=\"Psadnsr\"/> That same year, Hussein elected to the National Assembly in 1959. During this period, he was also the president of the Higher Institute of Law and Economics and would later go on to become the president of the University Institute. In the first post-independence government of [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], Hussein served as Minister of Interior from 1960 to 1962, and Minister of Public Works and Communications from 1962 to 1964.<ref name=HISSOM/><ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\n==Prime Minister of Somalia==\n===Civilian administration===\nCountrywide municipal elections, in which the [[Somali Youth League]] won 74 percent of the seats, occurred in November 1963. These were followed in March 1964 by the country's [[1964 Somali parliamentary election|first post-independence national elections]]. Again the SYL triumphed, winning 69 out of 123 parliamentary seats. The party's true margin of victory was even greater, as the fifty-four seats won by the opposition were divided among a number of small parties.\n\nAfter the 1964 National Assembly election in March, a crisis occurred that left Somalia without a government until the beginning of September. President [[Aden Abdullah Osman Daar|Osman]], who was empowered to propose the candidate for prime minister after an election or the fall of a government, chose Abdirizak Haji Hussein as his nominee instead of the incumbent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who had the endorsement of the SYL party leadership. Shermarke had been prime minister for the four previous years, and Osman decided that new leadership might be able to introduce fresh ideas for solving national problems.\n\nIn drawing up a Council of Ministers for presentation to the National Assembly, the nominee for prime minister chose candidates on the basis of ability and without regard to place of origin. But Hussein's choices strained intraparty relations and broke the unwritten rules that there be clan and regional balance. For instance, only two members of Shermarke's cabinet were to be retained, and the number of posts in northern hands was to be increased from two to five.\n\nThe SYL's governing Central Committee and its parliamentary groups became split. Hussein had been a party member since 1944 and had participated in the two previous Shermarke cabinets. His primary appeal was to younger and more educated party members. Several political leaders who had been left out of the cabinet joined the supporters of Shermarke to form an opposition group within the party. As a result, the Hussein faction sought support among non-SYL members of the National Assembly.\n\nAlthough the disagreements primarily involved personal or group political ambitions, the debate leading to the initial vote of confidence centered on the issue of [[Greater Somalia]]. Both Osman and prime minister-designate Hussein wanted to give priority to the country's internal economic and social problems.\n\nThe proposed cabinet failed to be affirmed by a margin of two votes. Seven National Assembly members, including Shermarke, abstained, while forty-eight members of the SYL voted for Hussein and thirty-three opposed him. Despite the apparent split in the SYL, it continued to attract recruits from other parties. In the first three months after the election, seventeen members of the parliamentary opposition resigned from their parties to join the SYL.\n\nOsman ignored the results of the vote and again nominated Hussein as prime minister. After intraparty negotiation, which included the reinstatement of four party officials expelled for voting against him, Hussein presented a second cabinet list to the National Assembly that included all but one of his earlier nominees. However, the proposed new cabinet contained three additional ministerial positions filled by men chosen to mollify opposition factions. The new cabinet was approved with the support of all but a handful of SYL National Assembly members. Hussein remained in office until the presidential elections of June 1967.\n\nThe 1967 presidential elections, conducted by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again the central issue was moderation versus militancy on the pan-Somali question. Osman, through Hussein, had stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, was elected president of the republic.\n\n===Greater Somalia===\nDue to the Somali government's vision of uniting Somali-inhabited territories, the administration was suspected of giving aid and support to the irredentist movements in the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the Northern Frontier District of northeastern Kenya, and French Somaliland. Even though Hussein favoured the idea of [[Greater Somalia]], he persistently denied reports that his government was involved in support. He stated his policy was to pursue the issue constitutional and peaceful means. He called for United Nations plebiscites in the Somali-inhabited areas outside the republic and asked for the [[Organization of African Unity]] to send fact-finding commissions to the areas to determine what the Somali inhabitants of these disputed areas desired. Neither organization responded to his calls but the Organization of African Unity passed a resolution favouring the retention of existing boundaries inherited from the European colonial powers throughout Africa.<ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\n==Later years==\nImmediately after the [[1969 Somali coup d'\u00e9tat]] that overthrew the civilian government, Hussein became a political prisoner and remained in detention from 1969 to April 1973. In 1974, he was appointed as Somalia's representative to the United Nations in 1974, and he held that position until 1979. During the Somali civil war, Hussein was called on several times to help reconcile the warring parties.<ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\nOn May 6, 2001, an effort by the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) to create the National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement (NCRPS), a 25-member working body, was stalled when Abdirizak Haji Hussein was named as its chief. The [[Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council]] (SRRC) and [[Puntland]]'s then leadership opposed the bid. On July 25, 2001, Hussein resigned from the post.<ref name=\"Rsfspmahhdiu\">{{cite web|last=Omar|first=Hussein|title=SOMALIA: Former Somali Prime Minister Abdirizak Haji Hussein died in USA|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/02/somalia-former-somali-prime-minister-abdirizak-haji-hussein-died-in-usa-2/|publisher=Raxanreeb|accessdate=1 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095531/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/02/somalia-former-somali-prime-minister-abdirizak-haji-hussein-died-in-usa-2/|archive-date=2014-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHussein died of pneumonia on 31 January 2014 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[United States]], after being hospitalized for a week.<ref name=\"SomaliCurrent\">{{cite web | url=http://www.somalicurrent.com/2014/01/31/somalias-former-prime-minister-dies-at-the-age-of-ninety/ | title=Somalia's former prime minister dies at the age of ninety | publisher=SomaliCurrent | accessdate=January 31, 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201131455/http://www.somalicurrent.com/2014/01/31/somalias-former-prime-minister-dies-at-the-age-of-ninety/ | archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nPrime Minister of Somalia [[Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed]] issued a statement a few hours later sending his condolences to Hussein's family and friends.

Hussein was buried beside his former colleague, [[Aden Abdulle Osman Daar]], the Somali Republic's first President.

Most of his Cabinet members and director generals were educated, young and energetic professionals who had been selected on the basis of merit. During his tenure as Somalia's ambassador to the United Nations, Hussein also signed a number of international agreements on the country's behalf, including the International Convention on Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.

He was elected the party's Secretary General a few months later, and became a Member of Parliament for the Nugal District of the Mudug region in 1959.<ref name=\"Psadnsr\"/> That same year, Hussein elected to the National Assembly in 1959. During this period, he was also the president of the Higher Institute of Law and Economics and would later go on to become the president of the University Institute. In the first post-independence government of [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], Hussein served as Minister of Interior from 1960 to 1962, and Minister of Public Works and Communications from 1962 to 1964.<ref name=HISSOM/><ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\n==Prime Minister of Somalia==\n===Civilian administration===\nCountrywide municipal elections, in which the [[Somali Youth League]] won 74 percent of the seats, occurred in November 1963. These were followed in March 1964 by the country's [[1964 Somali parliamentary election|first post-independence national elections]]. Again the SYL triumphed, winning 69 out of 123 parliamentary seats. The party's true margin of victory was even greater, as the fifty-four seats won by the opposition were divided among a number of small parties.\n\nAfter the 1964 National Assembly election in March, a crisis occurred that left Somalia without a government until the beginning of September. President [[Aden Abdullah Osman Daar|Osman]], who was empowered to propose the candidate for prime minister after an election or the fall of a government, chose Abdirizak Haji Hussein as his nominee instead of the incumbent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who had the endorsement of the SYL party leadership. Shermarke had been prime minister for the four previous years, and Osman decided that new leadership might be able to introduce fresh ideas for solving national problems.\n\nIn drawing up a Council of Ministers for presentation to the National Assembly, the nominee for prime minister chose candidates on the basis of ability and without regard to place of origin. But Hussein's choices strained intraparty relations and broke the unwritten rules that there be clan and regional balance. For instance, only two members of Shermarke's cabinet were to be retained, and the number of posts in northern hands was to be increased from two to five.\n\nThe SYL's governing Central Committee and its parliamentary groups became split. Hussein had been a party member since 1944 and had participated in the two previous Shermarke cabinets. His primary appeal was to younger and more educated party members. Several political leaders who had been left out of the cabinet joined the supporters of Shermarke to form an opposition group within the party. As a result, the Hussein faction sought support among non-SYL members of the National Assembly.\n\nAlthough the disagreements primarily involved personal or group political ambitions, the debate leading to the initial vote of confidence centered on the issue of [[Greater Somalia]]. Both Osman and prime minister-designate Hussein wanted to give priority to the country's internal economic and social problems.\n\nThe proposed cabinet failed to be affirmed by a margin of two votes. Seven National Assembly members, including Shermarke, abstained, while forty-eight members of the SYL voted for Hussein and thirty-three opposed him. Despite the apparent split in the SYL, it continued to attract recruits from other parties. In the first three months after the election, seventeen members of the parliamentary opposition resigned from their parties to join the SYL.\n\nOsman ignored the results of the vote and again nominated Hussein as prime minister. After intraparty negotiation, which included the reinstatement of four party officials expelled for voting against him, Hussein presented a second cabinet list to the National Assembly that included all but one of his earlier nominees. However, the proposed new cabinet contained three additional ministerial positions filled by men chosen to mollify opposition factions. The new cabinet was approved with the support of all but a handful of SYL National Assembly members. Hussein remained in office until the presidential elections of June 1967.\n\nThe 1967 presidential elections, conducted by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again the central issue was moderation versus militancy on the pan-Somali question. Osman, through Hussein, had stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, was elected president of the republic.\n\n===Greater Somalia===\nDue to the Somali government's vision of uniting Somali-inhabited territories, the administration was suspected of giving aid and support to the irredentist movements in the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the Northern Frontier District of northeastern Kenya, and French Somaliland. Even though Hussein favoured the idea of [[Greater Somalia]], he persistently denied reports that his government was involved in support. He stated his policy was to pursue the issue constitutional and peaceful means. He called for United Nations plebiscites in the Somali-inhabited areas outside the republic and asked for the [[Organization of African Unity]] to send fact-finding commissions to the areas to determine what the Somali inhabitants of these disputed areas desired. Neither organization responded to his calls but the Organization of African Unity passed a resolution favouring the retention of existing boundaries inherited from the European colonial powers throughout Africa.<ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\n==Later years==\nImmediately after the [[1969 Somali coup d'\u00e9tat]] that overthrew the civilian government, Hussein became a political prisoner and remained in detention from 1969 to April 1973. In 1974, he was appointed as Somalia's representative to the United Nations in 1974, and he held that position until 1979. During the Somali civil war, Hussein was called on several times to help reconcile the warring parties.<ref name=DICAFRBIO/>\n\nOn May 6, 2001, an effort by the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) to create the National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement (NCRPS), a 25-member working body, was stalled when Abdirizak Haji Hussein was named as its chief. The [[Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council]] (SRRC) and [[Puntland]]'s then leadership opposed the bid. On July 25, 2001, Hussein resigned from the post.<ref name=\"Rsfspmahhdiu\">{{cite web|last=Omar|first=Hussein|title=SOMALIA: Former Somali Prime Minister Abdirizak Haji Hussein died in USA|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/02/somalia-former-somali-prime-minister-abdirizak-haji-hussein-died-in-usa-2/|publisher=Raxanreeb|accessdate=1 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095531/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/02/somalia-former-somali-prime-minister-abdirizak-haji-hussein-died-in-usa-2/|archive-date=2014-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHussein died of pneumonia on 31 January 2014 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[United States]], after being hospitalized for a week.<ref name=\"SomaliCurrent\">{{cite web | url=http://www.somalicurrent.com/2014/01/31/somalias-former-prime-minister-dies-at-the-age-of-ninety/ | title=Somalia's former prime minister dies at the age of ninety | publisher=SomaliCurrent | accessdate=January 31, 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201131455/http://www.somalicurrent.com/2014/01/31/somalias-former-prime-minister-dies-at-the-age-of-ninety/ | archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nPrime Minister of Somalia [[Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed]] issued a statement a few hours later sending his condolences to Hussein's family and friends.

Hussein was buried beside his former colleague, [[Aden Abdulle Osman Daar]], the Somali Republic's first President.
