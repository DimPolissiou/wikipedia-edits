During the French Revolution it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty, although Phrygian caps did not originally function as liberty caps.<ref>Richard Wrigley, \"Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997, p. 132.</ref> The original cap of liberty was the Roman ''[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]'', the felt cap of manumitted (emancipated) slaves of ancient Rome, which was an attribute of [[Libertas]], the Roman goddess of liberty.

It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, in particular France's [[Marianne]], are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.  \n{{Coin image box 1 double\n| header = 20 [[centime]] with [[Marianne]] on obverse\n| image = File:20 Centimes (France).jpg\n| caption_left = '''Obverse''':  Marianne wearing the Phrygian cap of liberty.\n| caption_right = '''Reverse''': Face value and French motto: \"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\".\n| width = 230\n| footer = This coin was minted from 1962 to 2001.\n| position = right\n| margin = 0\n}}\n\n==In antiquity==\n\n===In the early Hellenistic world===\n\nBy the 4th century BC (early [[Hellenistic period]]) the Phrygian cap was associated with [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[Attis]], the consort of [[Cybele]], the cult of which had by then become graecified. At around the same time, the cap appears in depictions of the legendary king [[King Midas|Midas]] and other Phrygians in Greek [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-painting]]s and sculpture.<ref>Lynn E. Roller, \"The Legend of Midas\", ''Classical Antiquity,'' '''2'''.2 (October 1983:299\u2013313) p. 305.</ref> Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap.\n\nBy extension, the Phrygian cap came to be applied to several other non-Greek-speaking peoples (\"[[barbarian]]s\" in the classical sense) as well. Most notable of these extended senses of \"Phrygian\" were the [[Troy|Trojan]]s and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Aeneas]], and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict [[Amazons]] and so-called \"Scythian\" archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from \"[[Phrygian helmet]]s\" by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as \"barbarians\" by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian [[Tanagra figurine]]s of an effeminate [[Eros]], and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the [[Commagene]], in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of [[Thrace|Thracians]] also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably [[Bendis]], the Thracian goddess of the moon and the hunt, and [[Orpheus]], a legendary Thracian poet and musician.\n\nWhile the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called \"[[Phrygian helmet]]s\" (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in [[black-figure pottery|black-figure]] or [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (''cf.'' [[Peltast]]s of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear \u2013 aside from the traditional ''[[alopekis]]'' caps of fox skin \u2013 also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones.\n\n===In the Roman world===\nThe Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term \"Phrygian\"), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On [[Trajan's Column]], which commemorated Trajan's epic wars with the [[Dacians]] (101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Trajan's Dacian prisoners. The prisoner, accompanying Trajan in the monumental, 3 m tall statue of Trajan in the ancient Turkish city of Laodicea, is wearing a Phrygian Cap. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century [[Arch of Septimius Severus]], which commemorates Roman victories over the [[Parthian Empire]]. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the [[4th century]] [[Arch of Constantine]].\n\nThe Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion [[Mithraism]]. This astrology-centric [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Roman mystery cult]] ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]) projected itself with [[Zoroaster#In classical antiquity|pseudo-Oriental]] trappings (known as ''perserie'' in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called \"[[tauroctony]]\" [[cult image]]s), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers [[Cautes and Cautopates]] are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its ''perserie''.\n\n[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] art (and continuing well into the [[Middle Ages]]) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his \"Magi\" as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the \"[[Biblical Magi|three wise men]]\" (that follow [[Star of Bethlehem|a ''star'']]) with Phrygian caps.\n{{Gallery\n  |title=Instance of antique Phrygian caps\n  |align=center\n  |File:Artemis Bendis Louvre CA159.jpg|[[Bendis]], [[Thrace|Thracian]] goddess of the moon and the hunt, wearing a Phrygian cap.

Following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the ''pileus'' to signify the end of Caesar's [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] and a return to the (Roman) republican system.<ref> Cf. Appian, Civil Wars 2:119: \"The murderers wished to make a speech in the Senate, but as nobody remained there they wrapped their togas around their left arms to serve as shields, and, with swords still reeking with blood, ran, crying out that they had slain a king and tyrant. One of them bore a cap on the end of a spear as a symbol of freedom, and exhorted the people to restore the government of their fathers and recall the memory of the elder Brutus and of those who took the oath together against ancient kings.\"</ref>\n\nThese Roman associations of the ''pileus'' with liberty and [[republicanism]] were carried forward to the 18th-century, when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, with the Phrygian cap then becoming a symbol of those values.<ref name=\"YK\">{{citation|title=The Liberty Cap as a Revolutionary Symbol in America and France|first=Yvonne|last=Korshak|journal=Smithsonian Studies in American Art|volume=1|issue=2|year=1987|pages=52\u201369|doi=10.1086/424051}}.</ref>\n\n===France's ''bonnet rouge''===\n{{main article|Symbolism in the French Revolution#Liberty cap}}\n[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|French revolutionaries wearing ''bonnets rouges'' and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s.]]\n[[File:GillrayBritannia.jpg|thumb|In this 1793 British cartoon by [[James Gillray]], who was deeply hostile to the French Revolution, a Phrygian cap substitutes for [[Scylla]] atop the dangerous \"Rock of Democracy\", as [[Britannia]]'s boat (Constitution) navigates [[between Scylla and Charybdis|between Scylla's rock and Charybdis]], the \"Whirlpool of Arbitrary-Power\", pursued by Scylla's \"dogs\": [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]], [[Charles James Fox|Fox]], and [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], depicted as sharks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Britannia between Scylla & Charybdis. or... |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/94509857/ |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>]]\n; In revolutionary France\nIn 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility [[revolt of the papier timbr\u00e9|Stamp-Paper revolt]] erupted in [[Brittany]] and north-western France, where it became known as the ''bonnets rouges'' uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. [[Robespierre]] would later object to the color, but was ignored.\n\nThe use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].<ref>Albert Mathiez, ''Les Origines des cultures r\u00e9volutionnaires, 1789\u20131792'' (Paris 1904:34).</ref> To this day the national allegory of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.<ref>Richard Wrigley, \"Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131\u2013169.</ref>\n\nBy wearing the ''bonnet rouge'' and ''[[sans-culottes]]'' (\"without silk breeches\"), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the ''bonnet rouge'' as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as \"the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration.\" On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe Kellermann]], 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the ''bonnet rouge'' as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris city council]] declared it the official hairstyle of all its members.\n\nThe ''bonnet rouge'' on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the [[National Convention]]. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when [[Louis XVI]] was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the ''bonnet rouge''.<ref>Harris 1981:284, fig. 1. Most of the details that follow are drawn from Ms. Harris.</ref> The bust of [[Voltaire]] was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] in March 1792.\n\nDuring the period of the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 1793 \u2013 July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as ''[[tricoteuse]]s'', who sat beside the [[guillotine]] during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions.<ref name=\"CMc\">{{citation|last=Harden|first=J.

The symbols reappeared briefly in March\u2013July 1815 during \"[[Hundred Days|Napoleon's Hundred Days]]\", but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of [[Louis XVIII]] on 8 July 1815.\n\nThe symbols resurfaced again during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] of [[Louis Philippe I]], and the revolutionary symbols{{mdash}}anthem, holiday, and ''bonnet rouge''{{mdash}}became \"constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public.\"<ref name=\n\"Nord\">{{cite book|title=The Republican Moment: Struggles for Democracy in Nineteenth-Century France|author=Philip G.

By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax.\n\n===In the United States===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Senate.svg|thumb|right|upright|A Phrygian cap on the [[Seal of the United States Senate|Seal of the U.S. Senate]].]]\nIn the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]].

It also appears on the state flags of [[flag of West Virginia|West Virginia]] (as part of its official seal), [[Flag of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Flag of New York (state)|New York]], as well as the official seal of the [[United States Senate]], the state of [[Seal of Iowa|Iowa]], the state of [[Seal of North Carolina|North Carolina]] (as well as the arms of its [[North Carolina Senate|Senate]],<ref>{{Citation|contribution=Senate of North Carolina|title=College of Arms Newsletter, No. 8 (March 2006)|place=London|publisher =[[College of Arms]]|id=|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2006\n|accessdate =13 January 2008}}</ref>) and on the reverse side of the [[Seal of Virginia]].\n\nIn 1854, when sculptor [[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]] was preparing models for sculpture for the [[United States Capitol]], Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]] insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'', on the grounds that \"''American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave''\".

A number of national personifications, in particular France's [[Marianne]], are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.  \n{{Coin image box 1 double\n| header = 20 [[centime]] with [[Marianne]] on obverse\n| image = File:20 Centimes (France).jpg\n| caption_left = '''Obverse''':  Marianne wearing the Phrygian cap of liberty.\n| caption_right = '''Reverse''': Face value and French motto: \"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\".\n| width = 230\n| footer = This coin was minted from 1962 to 2001.\n| position = right\n| margin = 0\n}}\n\n==In antiquity==\n\n===In the early Hellenistic world===\n\nBy the 4th century BC (early [[Hellenistic period]]) the Phrygian cap was associated with [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[Attis]], the consort of [[Cybele]], the cult of which had by then become graecified. At around the same time, the cap appears in depictions of the legendary king [[King Midas|Midas]] and other Phrygians in Greek [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-painting]]s and sculpture.<ref>Lynn E. Roller, \"The Legend of Midas\", ''Classical Antiquity,'' '''2'''.2 (October 1983:299\u2013313) p. 305.</ref> Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap.\n\nBy extension, the Phrygian cap came to be applied to several other non-Greek-speaking peoples (\"[[barbarian]]s\" in the classical sense) as well. Most notable of these extended senses of \"Phrygian\" were the [[Troy|Trojan]]s and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Aeneas]], and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict [[Amazons]] and so-called \"Scythian\" archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from \"[[Phrygian helmet]]s\" by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as \"barbarians\" by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian [[Tanagra figurine]]s of an effeminate [[Eros]], and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the [[Commagene]], in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of [[Thrace|Thracians]] also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably [[Bendis]], the Thracian goddess of the moon and the hunt, and [[Orpheus]], a legendary Thracian poet and musician.\n\nWhile the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called \"[[Phrygian helmet]]s\" (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in [[black-figure pottery|black-figure]] or [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (''cf.'' [[Peltast]]s of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear \u2013 aside from the traditional ''[[alopekis]]'' caps of fox skin \u2013 also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones.\n\n===In the Roman world===\nThe Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term \"Phrygian\"), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On [[Trajan's Column]], which commemorated Trajan's epic wars with the [[Dacians]] (101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Trajan's Dacian prisoners. The prisoner, accompanying Trajan in the monumental, 3 m tall statue of Trajan in the ancient Turkish city of Laodicea, is wearing a Phrygian Cap. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century [[Arch of Septimius Severus]], which commemorates Roman victories over the [[Parthian Empire]]. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the [[4th century]] [[Arch of Constantine]].\n\nThe Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion [[Mithraism]]. This astrology-centric [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Roman mystery cult]] ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]) projected itself with [[Zoroaster#In classical antiquity|pseudo-Oriental]] trappings (known as ''perserie'' in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called \"[[tauroctony]]\" [[cult image]]s), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers [[Cautes and Cautopates]] are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its ''perserie''.\n\n[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] art (and continuing well into the [[Middle Ages]]) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his \"Magi\" as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the \"[[Biblical Magi|three wise men]]\" (that follow [[Star of Bethlehem|a ''star'']]) with Phrygian caps.\n{{Gallery\n  |title=Instance of antique Phrygian caps\n  |align=center\n  |File:Artemis Bendis Louvre CA159.jpg|[[Bendis]], [[Thrace|Thracian]] goddess of the moon and the hunt, wearing a Phrygian cap.

Following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the ''pileus'' to signify the end of Caesar's [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] and a return to the (Roman) republican system.<ref> Cf. Appian, Civil Wars 2:119: \"The murderers wished to make a speech in the Senate, but as nobody remained there they wrapped their togas around their left arms to serve as shields, and, with swords still reeking with blood, ran, crying out that they had slain a king and tyrant. One of them bore a cap on the end of a spear as a symbol of freedom, and exhorted the people to restore the government of their fathers and recall the memory of the elder Brutus and of those who took the oath together against ancient kings.\"</ref>\n\nThese Roman associations of the ''pileus'' with liberty and [[republicanism]] were carried forward to the 18th-century, when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, with the Phrygian cap then becoming a symbol of those values.<ref name=\"YK\">{{citation|title=The Liberty Cap as a Revolutionary Symbol in America and France|first=Yvonne|last=Korshak|journal=Smithsonian Studies in American Art|volume=1|issue=2|year=1987|pages=52\u201369|doi=10.1086/424051}}.</ref>\n\n===France's ''bonnet rouge''===\n{{main article|Symbolism in the French Revolution#Liberty cap}}\n[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|French revolutionaries wearing ''bonnets rouges'' and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s.]]\n[[File:GillrayBritannia.jpg|thumb|In this 1793 British cartoon by [[James Gillray]], who was deeply hostile to the French Revolution, a Phrygian cap substitutes for [[Scylla]] atop the dangerous \"Rock of Democracy\", as [[Britannia]]'s boat (Constitution) navigates [[between Scylla and Charybdis|between Scylla's rock and Charybdis]], the \"Whirlpool of Arbitrary-Power\", pursued by Scylla's \"dogs\": [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]], [[Charles James Fox|Fox]], and [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], depicted as sharks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Britannia between Scylla & Charybdis. or... |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/94509857/ |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>]]\n; In revolutionary France\nIn 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility [[revolt of the papier timbr\u00e9|Stamp-Paper revolt]] erupted in [[Brittany]] and north-western France, where it became known as the ''bonnets rouges'' uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. [[Robespierre]] would later object to the color, but was ignored.\n\nThe use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].<ref>Albert Mathiez, ''Les Origines des cultures r\u00e9volutionnaires, 1789\u20131792'' (Paris 1904:34).</ref> To this day the national allegory of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.<ref>Richard Wrigley, \"Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131\u2013169.</ref>\n\nBy wearing the ''bonnet rouge'' and ''[[sans-culottes]]'' (\"without silk breeches\"), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the ''bonnet rouge'' as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as \"the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration.\" On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe Kellermann]], 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the ''bonnet rouge'' as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris city council]] declared it the official hairstyle of all its members.\n\nThe ''bonnet rouge'' on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the [[National Convention]]. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when [[Louis XVI]] was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the ''bonnet rouge''.<ref>Harris 1981:284, fig. 1. Most of the details that follow are drawn from Ms. Harris.</ref> The bust of [[Voltaire]] was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] in March 1792.\n\nDuring the period of the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 1793 \u2013 July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as ''[[tricoteuse]]s'', who sat beside the [[guillotine]] during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions.<ref name=\"CMc\">{{citation|last=Harden|first=J.

The symbols reappeared briefly in March\u2013July 1815 during \"[[Hundred Days|Napoleon's Hundred Days]]\", but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of [[Louis XVIII]] on 8 July 1815.\n\nThe symbols resurfaced again during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] of [[Louis Philippe I]], and the revolutionary symbols{{mdash}}anthem, holiday, and ''bonnet rouge''{{mdash}}became \"constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public.\"<ref name=\n\"Nord\">{{cite book|title=The Republican Moment: Struggles for Democracy in Nineteenth-Century France|author=Philip G.

By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax.\n\n===In the United States===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Senate.svg|thumb|right|upright|A Phrygian cap on the [[Seal of the United States Senate|Seal of the U.S. Senate]].]]\nIn the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]].

It also appears on the state flags of [[flag of West Virginia|West Virginia]] (as part of its official seal), [[Flag of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Flag of New York (state)|New York]], as well as the official seal of the [[United States Senate]], the state of [[Seal of Iowa|Iowa]], the state of [[Seal of North Carolina|North Carolina]] (as well as the arms of its [[North Carolina Senate|Senate]],<ref>{{Citation|contribution=Senate of North Carolina|title=College of Arms Newsletter, No. 8 (March 2006)|place=London|publisher =[[College of Arms]]|id=|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2006\n|accessdate =13 January 2008}}</ref>) and on the reverse side of the [[Seal of Virginia]].\n\nIn 1854, when sculptor [[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]] was preparing models for sculpture for the [[United States Capitol]], Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]] insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'', on the grounds that \"''American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave''\".

{"title_page": "English medieval clothing", "text_new": "The [[Middle Ages|Medieval period]] in [[England]] is usually classified as the time between the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] to the beginning of the [[Renaissance]], roughly the years AD 410\u20131485. For various peoples living in England, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Anglo-Danes]], [[Normans]] and [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], clothing in the medieval era differed widely for men and women as well as for different classes in the social hierarchy.  The general styles of [[Early medieval European dress]] were shared in England.  In the later part of the period men's clothing changed much more rapidly than women's styles.  Clothes were very expensive and both the men and women of lower social classes continued to wear them until the garments were in such disrepair that they needed to be replaced entirely.  [[Sumptuary law]]s also divided social classes by regulating the colours and styles these various ranks were permitted to wear. In the early Middle Ages, clothing was typically simple and, particularly in the case of lower-class peoples, served only basic utilitarian functions such as modesty and protection from the elements. As time went on the advent of more advanced textile techniques and increased international relations, clothing gradually got more and more intricate and elegant, even with those under the wealthy classes, up into the renaissance.\n\n==Female dress==\n===Fifth and sixth centuries===\n{{main|Anglo-Saxon dress}}\nThe typical women's costume of this era was a long ''[[peplos]]''-like garment, pulled up to the armpit and worn over a sleeved under-garment, usually another dress. The garment was clasped front to back by fastening brooches at the shoulders. The dress could be belted or girdled, with tools and personal items suspended from the belt. Women in this period may or may not have worn a head covering.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=81}}{{sfn|Walton-Rogers|2007|pp=144, 149}}\nFleeces and furs were probably used as garment lining or as warm outer garments. A simple poncho made with a neck-opening for the head could have been made from skins of domesticated sheep or cattle. There is little evidence of footwear until the late sixth and seventh centuries.{{sfn|Walton-Rogers|2007|p=221}} Agricultural laborers shown ploughing and sowing in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] illustrated manuscripts work barefoot, which may indicate that footwear was not the norm until the middle Anglo-Saxon era.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Seventh to ninth centuries===\nChanges in Anglo-Saxon women's dress began in the latter half of the sixth century in [[Kent, England|Kent]] and spread to other regions at the beginning of the seventh century. These fashion changes show the decreasing influence of [[Northern Europe]] and the increasing influence of the [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]  and a revival of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]]. Linen is used more widely for garments and under-garments. Although there is little evidence to show whether women wore leggings or stockings under their gowns, it is more than likely that leg-covering were worn by women during this period.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=83}}\n[[File:New Minster Charter 966 detail Mary.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in Anglo-Saxon dress, ''New Minster Charter'', 966]]\n\n===Tenth and eleventh centuries===\nWomen typically wore a sleeveless overgarment, with or without hood during this time period. The hood consisted of either a scarf wrapped around the head and neck or an unconnected head covering with an opening for the face. It was assumed that the hooded style was influenced by [[Near Eastern]] art.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=213, 220}} Women are shown wearing ankle-length,  tailored gowns in contemporary art of this period. Gowns are often depicted with a distinct border, sometimes in a contrasting colour. In the tenth century, women's arms are typically covered. Sleeves are seen as straight, with a slight flare at the end. Braided or embroidered borders often decorated sleeves. By the eleventh century, multiple sleeve styles had come into fashion.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=213\u2014215}}\n\nThe girdles and buckled belts that were popular in the fifth and sixth century, with tools and personal items suspended from the belt, have gone out of fashion by the tenth century.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=217}} Women wear simple ankle shoes and slippers in the tenth and eleventh century. Archaeological evidence suggests that a variety of shoe styles were available to women during this period.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=82, 83}}\n\n===Twelfth to fourteenth centuries===\nAround the year 1300 there was a change in well-off women's clothing, to tighter-fitting garments, lower necklines, and more curvaceous silhouettes; \"very tight lacing was used on women's clothes to create a form-fitting shape which, girdled at the hips, created a long-waisted appearance\".<ref>Alchin, L. K. \"sumptuary laws\"</ref> Clothing was over-lapped and tightly bound; \"The female chest was frequently exposed, yet the true structure of the female body was visually distorted\u2026\".{{sfn|Hollander|1992|p=29}} The open [[surcoat]], a garment with an open bodice and a skirt that trailed to the ground, became \"one of the most elegant inventions of the Middle Ages\u2026\".{{sfn|Boucher|1983|p=199}} In fact, by the end of the 14th century, the [[gown|dress]] had replaced all garment items aside from the surcoat.\n\nThe basic garments for women consisted of the smock, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], [[kirtle]], dress, belt, surcoat, [[girdle]], [[cape]], [[Hood (headgear)|hood]], and [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].<ref>Sutton 10</ref> Each piece had designated colours and fabrics, for example \"Materials used in the middle ages were woolen cloth, [[Fur clothing|fur]], [[linen]], [[cambric]], [[silk]], and the cloth of silver or gold\u2026the richer Middle Age women would wear more expensive materials such as silk, or linen\".<ref name=\"yesnet.yk.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yesnet.yk.ca|title=Yukon Education Student Network|work=yesnet.yk.ca}}</ref> The development of the [[skirt]] was significant for women's medieval clothing, \"The more fashionable would wear very large or wide skirts\".<ref name=\"yesnet.yk.ca\"/> The [[petticoat]] made way for the skirt, which quickly became a popular garment because it \"wraps rather than enclosing, touches without grasping, brushes without clasping, coasts, caresses, skims, strokes\".{{sfn|Connor|2002|p=261}}\n\nThe [[headdress]], in various forms culminating in the [[hennin]] was an important element in women's dress, often complicated arrangements of hair and fabric, sometimes including [[veil]]s over the face or hanging behind the head, this is where the bridal veil originated from.<ref name=\"Laver 123\">{{harvnb|Laver|1967|p=123}}.</ref> The importation of luxurious fabrics increased over the period, and their use widened somewhat spread from the top of the elite downwards,<ref name=\"Laver 123\"/> but clothing remained very expensive and relatively few items were owned except by very wealthy people.\n\n==Male dress==\n\n===Fifth and sixth centuries===\n{{main|Anglo-Saxon dress}}\n\n====Common attire====\nEarly [[Anglo-Saxon]], regardless of social rank, wore a [[cloak]], [[tunic]], [[trousers]], [[leggings]], and accessories. The short, fur-lined cloak was designed so that the skin of the animal faced outward and the fur brushed against the undergarments. However, woolen cloaks have also been found. The garment opened either at the front or at the right shoulder. A single [[brooch]], usually circular in shape, fastened the square or rectangular cloak. Other means of fastening the cloth together included tying, lacing, or using a clasp; often made of natural materials such as thorn, bones, wood, or horns. The less prosperous wore woolen cloaks.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=106\u2013110}}\n\nThe tunic ended between the hip and the knee and had either long or short sleeves. Clasps were not needed to hold the tunic together because when pulled over the head it would sit snugly around the neck without the use of lacing or ties, indicating that the garment was one continuous piece.  A [[belt (clothing)|belt]] or [[girdle]] was usually worn with the tunic and might have had a buckle, and, as [[Gale Owen-Crocker]] states, \"pouched over the belt\".{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=121}} Multiple tunics were worn at once so that the lower one, often short sleeved, served as a shirt.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nTrousers, traditionally worn under a short tunic or with a small [[cloak]], were ankle length. If loose, the excess material was bunched around the waist and, as Owen-Crocker describes, \"hung in folds around the legs\".{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=115}} [[Garters]] or leggings accompanied narrow trousers. Pieces of fabric attached to the trousers forming belt loops so that the garment could be at held in place at the waist by a belt.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\nLeggings, usually worn in pairs, acted as additional protection for the legs. The first legging, referred to as the legging proper or [[stocking]], consisted of woven fabric or leather. The second was simply a leather of fabric used to tie on the leggings or, if worn around the shin or foot, provided warmth and protection. The lower caste wore leggings made of ripped or cut cloth from old clothes, blankets, or bags whereas the upper caste had custom made leggings.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=118}} The very rich people sometimes wore jewels.\n\nBelts worn at the hips were more of a necessity rather than a luxury. Buckles were common and most faced the front; however others have been found to face both sides or even, in some cases, were placed at the back of the body.  Owen-Crocker mentions that \"belt ornaments and tags\" dangled from the belts of the Anglo-Saxons in addition to everyday equipment.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=119}} Beads occasionally acted as alternatives, although not often. Leather belts, often decorated, were the most common. Intricate belts, worn to be seen, were  placed in view while an additional belt or girdle held the trouser in place under the tunic.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=119\u2013121}}\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons usually covered their bare feet, except when working. Shoes were made of leather and secured with straps.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=123}} Hats and hoods were commonly worn as were gloves and mittens.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=126}}\n\n===Seventh to tenth centuries===\n\n====General attire====\nClothing of the seventh through the 9th centuries was similar to that of previous centuries and again all classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. These common pieces consisted of tunics, cloaks, [[jacket]]s, pants, and shoes. As in the 5th and 6th centuries, a linen shirt acted as an undergarment. Men generally wore a knee-length linen or woolen tunic, depending on the season, over their shirts. The sleeves of the tunic were long and close fitting and excess material was pushed up the arm from the elbow to the wrist so that \"rolls\" were formed in the material.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 32\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=32}}.</ref> The neck of the tunic opened as did both sides and a belt or girdle was usually worn around the waist. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist, or border and for peasants, or the working classes, a plain tunic with sleeves was generally worn. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \"gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 36\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=36}}.</ref> The nobility tended to wear longer tunics than the lower social classes.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=28}}.</ref>{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nA cloak, worn over the tunic, fastened on either the breast or a shoulder with the assistance of a brooch. Once in place, the brooch was left attached to the garment so that the cloak was slipped over the head.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=33}} The cloak, knee-length and rectangular in shape, was fastened so that it appeared to be [[pleat]]ed or folded. Hoods and [[Collar (clothing)|collar]]s began to appear in the 9th century, and around the same time, the cloak began to be curbed by the same belt that was worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 178\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=178}}.</ref><ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 179\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=179}}.</ref> The wrap-over [[Coat (clothing)|coat]] also made an appearance during this era. This knee-length coat wrapped over the front of the body. Its sleeves were, as Owen-Crocker says, \"deep, [with] decorated cuffs which [were] mostly straight\".<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=180}}.</ref> For the lower classes, this coat tended to be plainer than that of the nobility.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\" />\n\nThe waistcoat or jacket appeared during this time as well. For those who could afford it, the jacket was made of fur while less costly ones were made of linen. This jacket was waist-length and tended to have a broad collar.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=181}}\n\nThe trousers in this era were shortened to mid thigh and stockings, made of leather, met them there. Atop the stockings, rounds of cloth, linen, or leather were worn which started at the ankle and ended just below the knee, as Planch\u00e9 explains, in \"close rolls\u2026 or crisscrossing each other sandal-wise\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 34\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=34}}.</ref> Planch\u00e9 states that socks began to be worn over the stocking and were \"banded at the top\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 35\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=35}}.</ref> Shoes of this era, painted black, had an opening down the instep and were secured with straps. Anglo-Saxons appreciated shoes and thus all classes wore them. Common colours for this era consisted of red, blue, and green.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=34\u201338}}\n\n====King====\n[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|7th-century shoulder clasp for an Anglo-Saxon king]] Until the 9th century, the king or reigning authority wore ringed byrne which, as Planch\u00e9 explains, was \"formed of rings sewn flat upon a leather tunic\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\" /> This person also carried a projecting shield and \"long, broad, straight iron sword\" as Planch\u00e9 states.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\" /> [[Image:New Minster Charter 966 detail Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|King Edgar of England from 959\u2013975]] A square crown was worn as was a longer cloak.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 179\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 27\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=27}}.</ref>  Beginning in the 9th century, the metal of the king was inscribed and later in the century silk began to be worn by both the king and the nobility.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 36\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 35\" />\n\n====Military====\nWell-armed Anglo-Saxon soldiers wore wrap-over coats decorated like chain mail with sleeves that narrowed at the wrists, these were often embroiled with flowers or plants.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 27\" /> Owen-Crocker explains that the belts of commanders were elaborate, wide, and fastened by \"a narrow strap which was riveted to the broad belt and passed through a buckle which was much narrower than the belt itself\" leaving the end of the belt to hang down.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 120\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=120}}.</ref>  Also attached to the belt were pouches which allowed soldiers to carry their weapons.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 120\" />  In the 9th and 10th centuries, military attire did not differ much from that of civil attire. The only changes were in the form of short linen tunics with metal collars and the addition of a sword, spear, shield, and helmet.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=41}} Weapons and clothes fittings worn on the battlefield were highly decorated with jewellery techniques, as seen in the discoveries at [[Sutton Hoo]] and in the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]; the concept of parade wear did not exist for the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n====Clergy====\nPlanch\u00e9 asserts that the clergy of the 9th and 10th centuries dressed similarly to the [[laity]], except when saying [[mass]]. Beginning in the later 8th century, the clergy were forbidden to wear bright colours or expensive or valuable fabrics.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=51\u201352}} Owen-Crocker mentions that their twill cloaks were generally shorter than those of the laity, reaching just below the waist, and Planch\u00e9 adds, that they wore linen stocking.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 178\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 34\" />\n\n===Eleventh century===\n\n====General attire====\nPlanch\u00e9 explains that in the 11th century, shortened tunics became popular as did shorter hair styles and beard lengths. Piercings also became fashionable for men as did golden bracelets.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=67}} During this era men continued to wear tunics, cloaks, and trousers which did not vary much from their previous counterparts. [[Coif]]s became popular head-coverings and appeared to be \"flat round cap[s]\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 71-72\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=71\u201372}}.</ref> Long stockings, with feet attached, were in style, and leg bandages and shoes continued to be worn. Short boots, those only extending to the ankle, were introduced in the latter part of the century.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 71-72\" />\n\n====Military attire====\n[[Image:Sutton Hoo helmet 2016.png|thumb|left|7th-century Anglo-Saxon helmet from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]\nMilitary attire was simply regular clothing with the addition of adornments depending on the number of \"marks\" a soldier had.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 61\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=61}}.</ref> These additions consisted of a spear, axe, sword, bow, shield, steel cap, helmet, an iron coat, or a linen or cloth tunic. During this era, soldiers carried either round or crescent shaped shields usually painted red. Higher-ranking officials decorated their swords with various colours and insignias.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=60\u201363}} In the middle half of the century, armor began to be made of leather and weapons were made light-weight. Previous mail tunics, found to be too heavy preventing the soldier from properly fighting, were replaced by the new leather armor, which consisted of overlapping flaps, cut like scales or leaves and each dyed a different colour.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=68}}\n\nIn the latter half of the century, warriors shaved their heads to resemble the clergy in order to confuse foreign spies.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 72\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=72}}.</ref> The [[cowl]], which was covered in rings, emerged during this time and was worn under the helmet, which also had a new addition, the nose piece. The ringed knee-length tunic was slit in the front and back to allow for more comfortable riding. The length of the trousers became shorter. \"Mascled armor\" began to replace the traditional ringed armory. These new iron pieces were assembled to look like mesh or nets but a combination of the two patterns have been found to be used. Another variation included covering the body in rings and removing the sleeves from the tunic. Planch\u00e9 mentions that a \"square pectoral\" was added to the breast of the armor as added protection and were \"quilted or covered with rings\".{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=77}} A yellow border was added to the pectorals, sleeves, and skirts. Shields had two new adjustments: one strap looped around the arm while a second strap circled around the neck, allowing the soldier the use of both his hands.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=75\u201378}}\n\n====Clergy====\nThe clergy of the 11th century had shaved heads and wore [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]], which, according to Planch\u00e9, were \"slightly sinking in the centre, with the pendent ornaments of the [[mitre]] attached to the side of it\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 83\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=83}}.</ref> Other garments included the [[chasuble]], the outermost liturgical vestment, which retained its shape, and the [[dalmatic]]s, a tunic like vestment with large, bell shaped sleeves, which tended to be arched on the sides. The [[Crosier|pastoral staff]] was generally found to be plain in colour and ornamentation.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 83\" />\n\n===Twelfth century===\n{{main|1100\u20131200 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\nThe 12th century brought changes in the civil attire for the inhabitants of the British Isles.  The tunic was now close fitting with a long skirt. There was, as [[C. Willett Cunnington|C. Willett]] and [[Phillis Cunnington]] describe, a \"slit up in front to the thigh level\" and the sleeves, now close fitting, were \"bell-shaped\" at the wrist or, the \"lower portion [hung] to form a pendulous cuff which might be rolled up for action\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=28}}.</ref> Peasants wore tunics which were shorter and the sleeves were \"tubular\u2026[and] rolled back\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\" /> The tunic could be worn with or without the girdle, which now carried the sword. Neck lines were either diagonal, from the neck moving across the chest, or horizontal, from the neck to the shoulder. The super tunic, worn with a girdle, was occasionally worn alone but was never paired with the aforementioned tunic.  The sleeves of this super tunic had, as the Cunningtons state, \"pendulous cuffs\", which were uncommon, or were \"loose and often elbow-length only\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=31}}.</ref>  The super tunic was occasionally lined with fur.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\nThe cloak and mantle, a cloak resembling a loose cape, were fastened either with a brooch or clasp, or as the Cunningtons describe, \"the corner of the neck edge on one side was pulled through a ring sewn to the opposite corner, and then knotted to keep in position\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" /> For the rich, the cloak was lined with fur and for all classes beneath, the cloak was hooded and made of animal hide, with the hair facing out.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\n===Thirteenth century===\n{{main|1200\u20131300 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\nFor the first half of the 13th century, linen braies were worn and then shortened to the knee in the second half of the century, which then became drawers or undergarments. Short stockings ended just below the knee and the border was occasionally decorated. Longer stockings, mid thigh length, could also be worn: as [[C. Willett Cunnington|C. Willett]] and [[Phillis Cunnington]] say, they were \"shaped to fit the leg, widening above the knee so that they could be pulled up over the braies\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" /> The stockings and girdle were tied together at a point in the top front of the stocking by which to keep it in place. Some stockings had stirrups, whole feet, or no feet. For hosiery, made of wool or leather, a \"thin leather sole was attached\" so that shoes would not need to be worn.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />  Leg wear during the 12th century tended to be brightly coloured and stripes were popular.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\nAll classes of men during the 12th century wore shoes or boots. Shoes, as the Cunningtons say, were \"open over the foot and fastened in front of the ankle with a strap secured by a brooch or buckle\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=33}}.</ref>  For the wealthy, the bands on shoes were decorated and designs were often found \"over the foot or around the heel\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Different styles of shoes began to appear during this era. One such, as the Cunningtons state, was \"high around the ankle and slit down the sides or in front\" while others were laced or had \"short uppers but cut high behind the heel\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Boots were most notably mid calf or knee length and laced down the front or along the inner side. These boots tended to be brightly coloured and had, in the Cunningtons' words, \"turn over tops\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Shorter boots, with pointed toes, were also worn and ended just above the ankle. Boots were made of leather from a cow or ox, cloth, fish skin, or, for those who could afford it, silk.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" />\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|thumb|right|Shoes with ankle strap and open instep, 1250]]\nSeparate hoods also made an appearance. They were loose with, as the Cunningtons describe, a \"pointed cowl\" and were attached to a robe stretching to the shoulders.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> The cape was usually a single piece of material and thus had to be put on over the head. The Cunningtons state that the \"pointed Phrygian cap,\" or the \"small, round cap with stalk or with a rolled brim and with or without the stalk\" or the \"stalked soft cap, resembling a beret\" were worn.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Travelers wore \"hats with large brims and low crowns\u2026over the hood\" which tied under the chin.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33-34\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref> Small hats with round crowns and, the Cunningtons say, \"turned-down brim, decorated with a knob instead of a stalk\" were also worn, as were coifs, which was a \"close fitting plain linen bonnet which covered the ears and confined the hair\" and tied under the chin.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=34}}.</ref> The coif could be worn with other hats or hoods.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33-34\" />\n\nAccessories for 12th century English men became more decorated. The girdle, mid century, became more elaborate in its ornamentation and in the latter half of the century, was, \"tied like a sash in front with hanging ends\" or, if \"long and elaborate, was fastened with ornamental buckles\" as the Cunningtons depict.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\" /> Wallets and purses, in the early half of the century, were hung from the girdle or the breech girdle and in the latter half were placed under the tunic, out of sight. During this era gloves became fashionable for the nobility, although they were seldom worn. Rings, brooches, buckles, clasps, and \"ornamental fillets of gold and silver\", according to the Cunningtons, were worn by the ruling classes.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 35\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=35}}.</ref> Wool, linen, and silk continued to be used, as was leather, which the peasants used for tunics and mantle and left the hair on facing outward. Garments were also embroidered during this era.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 35\" />\n\nMen continued to wear both short and long tunics with a girdle; however the slit up the front was removed. A new style was introduced in this era in which the sleeves and body were cut from one piece of material. A wide armhole, which extended to the waist, was left open and the sleeves were cut in order to, as the Cunningtons state, \"slope off to a narrow tight cuff at the wrist\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=42}}.</ref>  The super tunic of the 11th century continued to be worn by the less fashionable, the lower classes of society, and the girdle was optional.\n\nFive new styles of the super tunic were introduced in this era. The first consisted of a front and back panel which extended from the shoulders to the calf level. The two panels were sewn together or clasped together near the waist, where they were met by a slit up the front. The neck opening was large so that the tunic could be put on over the head and a belt was not usually worn with this tunic. The second new style was more \"voluminous\" as the Cunningtons describe it, and hung in folds to a length between the knees and the ankles.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\" /> The sleeves gathered at the shoulders and extended beyond the hands. A vertical slit was cut in the upper arm of the sleeve to allow unrestrained movement. This garment, like the previous, was put on over the head and a hood was often attached. The third style was much looser than the previous ones. The sleeves could extended to just below the elbow or could be worn short and wide. A buckled belt was optional. The fourth super tunic, or garnache, was knee length and the material was cut wide at the shoulders to allow the material to \"fall down on each side, predicting cape-like sleeves,\" as the Cunningtons put it.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=44}}.</ref> The sides of this tunic could be clasped at the waist, sewn from the waist to the hem, or left open and was traditionally beltless. The last style was simply sleeveless and worn with a belt.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />  For these cloaks and hoods red, Irish cloth was popular.{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=63}}\n[[Image:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|thumb|right|Working man of the 13th century]] \nFitchets, resembling modern day pockets, also appeared in the 13th century. Vertical slits were cut in the super tunic, which did not have any side openings, to allow access to purse or keys slung from the girdle of the tunic.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />\n\nMen's headwear of the 13th century, as the Cunningtons illustrate, consisted of the hood, which was sometimes buttoned, and stalked round caps and large rimmed traveling hats, both seen in the previous century. New to this era were hats with \"round brim[s] turned up at the back which could be worn reversed with the turn-up in front\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=47}}.</ref> Hats with round crowns also made an appearance and were sometimes found with a \"knob on the crown\" or with a \"moderate brim with a downward slope or a rolled brim\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" />  The coif continued to be worn much more frequently.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" />\n\nDuring this era garments such as cloaks, mantles, and stockings remained unchanged. However, during this era, stockings were sometimes tied with narrow strips of material below the knee to hold the stocking in place. Leg bandages for the nobility became popular which criss-crossed and extended above the knee.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />\n\nShoes during this era were designed so that each shoe was cut explicitly for an individual's foot. Shoes were plain, and most were closed around the ankle and were laced or buckled along the inner side of the foot. Other shoes exposed the top of the foot and either stretched high behind the ankle or were clasped near the ankle by an instep strap. Boots, as the Cunningtons describe, were briefly coloured along the top, had a much looser fit, and were barely extended to the calf.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> Calthrop adds that boots were \"turned over a little at the top\".{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=65}}\n\nMen's accessories were similar to those of the 11th century. Gloves continued to be worn by the nobility and could be long, stretching to the elbow, or short, wrist length, and began to be decorated, the Cunningtons explain, \"with a broad strip of gold embroidery down the back as far as the knuckles\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> By the end of the century, gloves were more widely worn and were ornamented with silver or [[Gilding|gilded]] buttons.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> Calthrop also includes that long hair and neatly trimmed beards were in style for 13th century men.{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=64}}\n\n===Fourteenth century===\n{{main|1300\u20131400 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\n[[Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Undergarment|braies]] or underwear]]\nMen's clothing of the 14th century was much more form fitting than its 13th century counterparts. During this era, many of the standard pieces that had been worn by the Britons evolved into new garments and took on different names. P. Cunnington explains that loose garments, such as the tunic and super tunic, from previous centuries continued to be worn by the lower classes who were less concerned with fashion.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 20\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|1968|p=20}}.</ref> These loose garments, as C. Cunnington states, were slit up the front, had sleeves, and were worn with a girdle. In addition, they could be shortened to the hip.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 55\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=55}}.</ref>\nThe gipon, also called a pourpoint or doublet, emerged during the 14th century. It replaced the tunic and was knee length and close-fitting. The gipon was not designed with any folds or gathers as the tunic was. The sleeves were long and tight and the neck was low. The bodice was padded and the garment was either buttoned or laced down the front, but for the lower classes it was only buttoned to the waist.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 55\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=57}}.</ref> The gipon was traditionally worn over a shirt and if worn with an outer garment, a belt was not worn.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 20\" /> At the end of the century, the gipon was shortened to above the mid-thigh and was worn with a belt at hip level <ref name=\" C. Cunnington 57\" />\n[[Image: Karl den store krons av leo III.jpg|thumb|right|The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] as depicted in the 14th century]]\nThe outer garment of this era was known as the cote-hardie and replaced the super tunic of previous centuries. This new low necked, knee length piece was tight fitting and buttoned or laced down the front to waist level, where it then \"flared into a full skirt which was open in the front\" as C. Cunnington describes.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\" /> The complex sleeves of the cote-hardie extended, in the front, to the elbow and, in back, hung in flaps which tapered and elongated. Sleeves during this era were decorated. A belt or girdle was worn with this new garment. The less fortunate wore looser core-hardies which did not fasten in the front. Instead, they were one piece and were put on over the head.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\" /><ref>Phillis 20</ref> Cloaks and capes continued to be worn as outdoor wear and didn't change from the previous century.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|1968|p=21}}.</ref>\n\nMen's stockings of the 14th century were lengthened and tied to the region, so that it was hidden under the skirt. Shorter stockings were tied to garters with stripes of wool or linen. Shorter boots and shoes also become fashionable. Woolen soles were added to shoes as were straps.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\nThe hood continued to be worn by men during this era. However, its shape changed. The pointed cowl was lengthened as P. Cunnington describes, \"into a long streamer..and from this another head-dress was made which was made in the form of a turban with a fall-over flap made from the hood cape\".<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" /> Stalked caps remained popular and small hats with close, turned up brims emerged. Toward the end of the century men began putting feathers in their hats for decoration.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\nGloves spread amongst the social hierarchy so that even those of the working class were wearing them in the 14th century. For this class, only the thumb and two sections existed for the fingers.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\n==Clothing and class==\nThe lowest classes in the Middle Ages did not have access to the same clothing as nobility. Poor men and women working in the fields or wet or muddy conditions often went barefoot.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004}} Upper and middle-class women wore three garments and the third garment was either a [[surcoat]], [[bliaut]], or [[cotehardie]]. These were often lavish garments, depending on the wealth of the person wearing them, and could have trimmings in [[fur]] or silk decorated with elaborate designs. Because of the cost of fabric, the working classes hardly wore this third garment.\n[[Image:Brouche.jpg|thumb|left|13th-century peasant working barefoot in the fields]]\n\nAnother marker of the upper classes was an elaborate headdress. These could involve wires, draping fabric and pointed caps. Again, because of the cost the poor could not afford these and instead wore simple cloth veils called [[wimples]] that \"draped over the head, around the neck and up to the chin\".<ref name=\"Hell\">{{harvnb|Hell}}.</ref> Working women wore ankle length dresses and men wore short tunics and breeches. The longer the garment, the higher in station a person was. This is evident in the sumptuary laws of 1327 which states \"coming to the lowest class no serving man is to use 2\u00bd yards in a short gown or 3 in a long one\".{{sfn|Hooper|1915|p=433}} Also, serving men such as servants or attendants usually did not wear cloaks, and for the nobles who did it served to distinguish them from the masses.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=234}}\n[[Image:Bayeux-feast02.jpg|thumb|Example of serving men in short tunics and lacking cloaks]]\n\nWhile most of the peasant women wove their fabric and then made their own clothing, the wealthy were able to afford [[tailors]], [[furriers]], and embroiderers. The wealthiest, such as royalty, would have \"all these craftsmen on staff, sometimes one per each adult in the household\".<ref name=\"Hartman\">{{harvnb|Hartman|2001}}.</ref>\n\nSocial status was of the utmost importance during the Middle Ages, and this idea was exemplified through fashion. For example, it was generally understood that scarlet tones, such as red and purple, were important items in the wardrobes of royalty.{{sfn|Piponnier|Mane|1997|p=71}} More specifically, these colours became reserved for Kings and Princes, and denoted luxury and wealth. The medieval [[sumptuary law]]s or \"acts of apparel\" were put into place to regulate the clothing choices of people during that time.{{sfn|Scattergood|1987|p=256}} Those who supported the enactment of such laws did so because the laws emphasized the differences between the classes, and clearly defined what those differences are.{{sfn|Piponnier|Mane|1997|p=83}} For example, the 1363 statute to the Clothing Law of 1337 states that wives of [[yeomen]] and handicraftsmen may not wear any [[veil]] or [[kerchief]] made of silk...the higher-status groups, however, are allowed to wear whatever imported items they want.<ref>Sponsler 270\u2013271</ref> This clearly states the understood division between the rich and poor during this era, and the importance of keeping the classes defined as separate entities. There were rules for every item of clothing; lower-class women were banned from wearing expensive veils. Only wives and daughters of wealthy men could wear [[velvet]] or [[satin]].<ref>middle-ages.org.uk</ref> There was an unfair discontinuity in the rules; lower class citizens could never wear an item designated for the upper class, whereas the upper class could wear anything that suited them. For example, wives and daughters of servants were not to wear veils that cost more than twelve cents.<ref>middle-ages.org.uk/sumptuary-laws-middle-ages</ref>\n\nThe English sumptuary acts of 1363 go into explicit detail about clothing items which were reserved for those below the king's status, putting restrictions on coat length and shoe height.{{sfn|Scattergood|1987|p=261}} In this legislation, the intention was to prevent men from acting as if they were from a higher class by way of how they dressed. The laws specifically stated that a man was to dress within the status in which he was born.<ref>Sutton 17</ref> The acts depicted what clothing was to be worn and also clearly stated how the classes were ranked, with kings and royalty at the top and servants at the bottom. Most of these organized lists did not include all groups of people. The majority of the lists consisted of divisions of the upper and middle classes, while the lower classes were neglected altogether. This was because the middle class was considered most likely to violate the clothing laws because they were supposedly most influenced by social pressures, whereas lower-class people did not have the capabilities to dress according to a higher ranking even if they desired to do so.<ref>Sponsler 281</ref> In fact, any mention of lower classes was done so out of necessity in order to complete the social hierarchy.\n\n==Textiles used==\nThe most common material used was [[wool]], with the wool ranging in texture and quality based on the type of sheep it came from.{{efn|See, for example [[broadcloth]], [[fustian]].}} The quality could range from the very coarse and undyed for the lower class to extremely fine with designs and colour for the upper class. [[Linen]] and [[hemp]] were other fabrics used, and were utilized often by the lower classes as undergarments and head coverings. Also, [[silk]] was a popular material used by the wealthy and was imported from Asia. After the crusades, fabrics such as damasks, [[velvet]]s, and [[satin]] were brought back to England,<ref name=\"Hartman\"/> as was [[samite]]. Animal skins were also used such as \"sheep-skin cloaks\u2026  in winter to keep out the cold and rain\".<ref>\"Clothes\"</ref> [[Leather]] was used to produce items such as shoes, belts, gloves and armor.{{sfn|Newman|2001}}\n\nThe middle class could usually afford to dye their wool colours like blue and green. The wealthy could afford to add elaborate designs to their clothing as well as dying it red and black, expensive colours for the time.<ref name=\"Hartman\"/> Purple was also considered a colour of royalty and was reserved for kings or religious figures such as the [[pope]].<ref name=\"Hell\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[England]]\n*[[1100\u20131200 in fashion]]\n*[[1200\u20131300 in fashion]]\n*[[1300\u20131400 in fashion]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon dress]]\n*[[History of clothing and textiles]]\n*[[Early Middle Ages]]\n*[[High Middle Ages]]\n*[[Early medieval European dress]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon brooches]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n|last       = Alchin\n|first      = L.K.\n|title      = Sumptuary Laws of the Middle Ages\n|url        = http://www.lordsandladies.org/sumptuary-laws-middle-ages.htm\n|accessdate = 2009-04-15\n|website    = The Middle Ages Website\n}}\n*{{cite web\n|last       = Alchin\n|first      = L.

For various peoples living in England, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Anglo-Danes]], [[Normans]] and [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], clothing in the medieval era differed widely for men and women as well as for different classes in the social hierarchy.  The general styles of [[Early medieval European dress]] were shared in England.  In the later part of the period men's clothing changed much more rapidly than women's styles.  Clothes were very expensive and both the men and women of lower social classes continued to wear them until the garments were in such disrepair that they needed to be replaced entirely.  [[Sumptuary law]]s also divided social classes by regulating the colours and styles these various ranks were permitted to wear. In the early Middle Ages, clothing was typically simple and, particularly in the case of lower-class peoples, served only basic utilitarian functions such as modesty and protection from the elements. As time went on the advent of more advanced textile techniques and increased international relations, clothing gradually got more and more intricate and elegant, even with those under the wealthy classes, up into the renaissance.\n\n==Female dress==\n===Fifth and sixth centuries===\n{{main|Anglo-Saxon dress}}\nThe typical women's costume of this era was a long ''[[peplos]]''-like garment, pulled up to the armpit and worn over a sleeved under-garment, usually another dress. The garment was clasped front to back by fastening brooches at the shoulders. The dress could be belted or girdled, with tools and personal items suspended from the belt. Women in this period may or may not have worn a head covering.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=81}}{{sfn|Walton-Rogers|2007|pp=144, 149}}\nFleeces and furs were probably used as garment lining or as warm outer garments. A simple poncho made with a neck-opening for the head could have been made from skins of domesticated sheep or cattle. There is little evidence of footwear until the late sixth and seventh centuries.{{sfn|Walton-Rogers|2007|p=221}} Agricultural laborers shown ploughing and sowing in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] illustrated manuscripts work barefoot, which may indicate that footwear was not the norm until the middle Anglo-Saxon era.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Seventh to ninth centuries===\nChanges in Anglo-Saxon women's dress began in the latter half of the sixth century in [[Kent, England|Kent]] and spread to other regions at the beginning of the seventh century. These fashion changes show the decreasing influence of [[Northern Europe]] and the increasing influence of the [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]  and a revival of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]]. Linen is used more widely for garments and under-garments. Although there is little evidence to show whether women wore leggings or stockings under their gowns, it is more than likely that leg-covering were worn by women during this period.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=83}}\n[[File:New Minster Charter 966 detail Mary.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in Anglo-Saxon dress, ''New Minster Charter'', 966]]\n\n===Tenth and eleventh centuries===\nWomen typically wore a sleeveless overgarment, with or without hood during this time period. The hood consisted of either a scarf wrapped around the head and neck or an unconnected head covering with an opening for the face. It was assumed that the hooded style was influenced by [[Near Eastern]] art.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=213, 220}} Women are shown wearing ankle-length,  tailored gowns in contemporary art of this period. Gowns are often depicted with a distinct border, sometimes in a contrasting colour. In the tenth century, women's arms are typically covered. Sleeves are seen as straight, with a slight flare at the end. Braided or embroidered borders often decorated sleeves. By the eleventh century, multiple sleeve styles had come into fashion.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=213\u2014215}}\n\nThe girdles and buckled belts that were popular in the fifth and sixth century, with tools and personal items suspended from the belt, have gone out of fashion by the tenth century.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=217}} Women wear simple ankle shoes and slippers in the tenth and eleventh century. Archaeological evidence suggests that a variety of shoe styles were available to women during this period.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=82, 83}}\n\n===Twelfth to fourteenth centuries===\nAround the year 1300 there was a change in well-off women's clothing, to tighter-fitting garments, lower necklines, and more curvaceous silhouettes; \"very tight lacing was used on women's clothes to create a form-fitting shape which, girdled at the hips, created a long-waisted appearance\".<ref>Alchin, L. K. \"sumptuary laws\"</ref> Clothing was over-lapped and tightly bound; \"The female chest was frequently exposed, yet the true structure of the female body was visually distorted\u2026\".{{sfn|Hollander|1992|p=29}} The open [[surcoat]], a garment with an open bodice and a skirt that trailed to the ground, became \"one of the most elegant inventions of the Middle Ages\u2026\".{{sfn|Boucher|1983|p=199}} In fact, by the end of the 14th century, the [[gown|dress]] had replaced all garment items aside from the surcoat.\n\nThe basic garments for women consisted of the smock, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]], [[kirtle]], dress, belt, surcoat, [[girdle]], [[cape]], [[Hood (headgear)|hood]], and [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].<ref>Sutton 10</ref> Each piece had designated colours and fabrics, for example \"Materials used in the middle ages were woolen cloth, [[Fur clothing|fur]], [[linen]], [[cambric]], [[silk]], and the cloth of silver or gold\u2026the richer Middle Age women would wear more expensive materials such as silk, or linen\".<ref name=\"yesnet.yk.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yesnet.yk.ca|title=Yukon Education Student Network|work=yesnet.yk.ca}}</ref> The development of the [[skirt]] was significant for women's medieval clothing, \"The more fashionable would wear very large or wide skirts\".<ref name=\"yesnet.yk.ca\"/> The [[petticoat]] made way for the skirt, which quickly became a popular garment because it \"wraps rather than enclosing, touches without grasping, brushes without clasping, coasts, caresses, skims, strokes\".{{sfn|Connor|2002|p=261}}\n\nThe [[headdress]], in various forms culminating in the [[hennin]] was an important element in women's dress, often complicated arrangements of hair and fabric, sometimes including [[veil]]s over the face or hanging behind the head, this is where the bridal veil originated from.<ref name=\"Laver 123\">{{harvnb|Laver|1967|p=123}}.</ref> The importation of luxurious fabrics increased over the period, and their use widened somewhat spread from the top of the elite downwards,<ref name=\"Laver 123\"/> but clothing remained very expensive and relatively few items were owned except by very wealthy people.\n\n==Male dress==\n\n===Fifth and sixth centuries===\n{{main|Anglo-Saxon dress}}\n\n====Common attire====\nEarly [[Anglo-Saxon]], regardless of social rank, wore a [[cloak]], [[tunic]], [[trousers]], [[leggings]], and accessories. The short, fur-lined cloak was designed so that the skin of the animal faced outward and the fur brushed against the undergarments. However, woolen cloaks have also been found. The garment opened either at the front or at the right shoulder. A single [[brooch]], usually circular in shape, fastened the square or rectangular cloak. Other means of fastening the cloth together included tying, lacing, or using a clasp; often made of natural materials such as thorn, bones, wood, or horns. The less prosperous wore woolen cloaks.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=106\u2013110}}\n\nThe tunic ended between the hip and the knee and had either long or short sleeves. Clasps were not needed to hold the tunic together because when pulled over the head it would sit snugly around the neck without the use of lacing or ties, indicating that the garment was one continuous piece.  A [[belt (clothing)|belt]] or [[girdle]] was usually worn with the tunic and might have had a buckle, and, as [[Gale Owen-Crocker]] states, \"pouched over the belt\".{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=121}} Multiple tunics were worn at once so that the lower one, often short sleeved, served as a shirt.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nTrousers, traditionally worn under a short tunic or with a small [[cloak]], were ankle length. If loose, the excess material was bunched around the waist and, as Owen-Crocker describes, \"hung in folds around the legs\".{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=115}} [[Garters]] or leggings accompanied narrow trousers. Pieces of fabric attached to the trousers forming belt loops so that the garment could be at held in place at the waist by a belt.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\nLeggings, usually worn in pairs, acted as additional protection for the legs. The first legging, referred to as the legging proper or [[stocking]], consisted of woven fabric or leather. The second was simply a leather of fabric used to tie on the leggings or, if worn around the shin or foot, provided warmth and protection. The lower caste wore leggings made of ripped or cut cloth from old clothes, blankets, or bags whereas the upper caste had custom made leggings.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=118}} The very rich people sometimes wore jewels.\n\nBelts worn at the hips were more of a necessity rather than a luxury. Buckles were common and most faced the front; however others have been found to face both sides or even, in some cases, were placed at the back of the body.  Owen-Crocker mentions that \"belt ornaments and tags\" dangled from the belts of the Anglo-Saxons in addition to everyday equipment.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=119}} Beads occasionally acted as alternatives, although not often. Leather belts, often decorated, were the most common. Intricate belts, worn to be seen, were  placed in view while an additional belt or girdle held the trouser in place under the tunic.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|pp=119\u2013121}}\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons usually covered their bare feet, except when working. Shoes were made of leather and secured with straps.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=123}} Hats and hoods were commonly worn as were gloves and mittens.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=126}}\n\n===Seventh to tenth centuries===\n\n====General attire====\nClothing of the seventh through the 9th centuries was similar to that of previous centuries and again all classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. These common pieces consisted of tunics, cloaks, [[jacket]]s, pants, and shoes. As in the 5th and 6th centuries, a linen shirt acted as an undergarment. Men generally wore a knee-length linen or woolen tunic, depending on the season, over their shirts. The sleeves of the tunic were long and close fitting and excess material was pushed up the arm from the elbow to the wrist so that \"rolls\" were formed in the material.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 32\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=32}}.</ref> The neck of the tunic opened as did both sides and a belt or girdle was usually worn around the waist. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist, or border and for peasants, or the working classes, a plain tunic with sleeves was generally worn. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \"gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 36\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=36}}.</ref> The nobility tended to wear longer tunics than the lower social classes.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=28}}.</ref>{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nA cloak, worn over the tunic, fastened on either the breast or a shoulder with the assistance of a brooch. Once in place, the brooch was left attached to the garment so that the cloak was slipped over the head.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=33}} The cloak, knee-length and rectangular in shape, was fastened so that it appeared to be [[pleat]]ed or folded. Hoods and [[Collar (clothing)|collar]]s began to appear in the 9th century, and around the same time, the cloak began to be curbed by the same belt that was worn over the tunic.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 178\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=178}}.</ref><ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 179\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=179}}.</ref> The wrap-over [[Coat (clothing)|coat]] also made an appearance during this era. This knee-length coat wrapped over the front of the body. Its sleeves were, as Owen-Crocker says, \"deep, [with] decorated cuffs which [were] mostly straight\".<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=180}}.</ref> For the lower classes, this coat tended to be plainer than that of the nobility.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\" />\n\nThe waistcoat or jacket appeared during this time as well. For those who could afford it, the jacket was made of fur while less costly ones were made of linen. This jacket was waist-length and tended to have a broad collar.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=181}}\n\nThe trousers in this era were shortened to mid thigh and stockings, made of leather, met them there. Atop the stockings, rounds of cloth, linen, or leather were worn which started at the ankle and ended just below the knee, as Planch\u00e9 explains, in \"close rolls\u2026 or crisscrossing each other sandal-wise\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 34\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=34}}.</ref> Planch\u00e9 states that socks began to be worn over the stocking and were \"banded at the top\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 35\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=35}}.</ref> Shoes of this era, painted black, had an opening down the instep and were secured with straps. Anglo-Saxons appreciated shoes and thus all classes wore them. Common colours for this era consisted of red, blue, and green.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=34\u201338}}\n\n====King====\n[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|7th-century shoulder clasp for an Anglo-Saxon king]] Until the 9th century, the king or reigning authority wore ringed byrne which, as Planch\u00e9 explains, was \"formed of rings sewn flat upon a leather tunic\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\" /> This person also carried a projecting shield and \"long, broad, straight iron sword\" as Planch\u00e9 states.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 28\" /> [[Image:New Minster Charter 966 detail Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|King Edgar of England from 959\u2013975]] A square crown was worn as was a longer cloak.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 179\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 27\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=27}}.</ref>  Beginning in the 9th century, the metal of the king was inscribed and later in the century silk began to be worn by both the king and the nobility.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 36\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 35\" />\n\n====Military====\nWell-armed Anglo-Saxon soldiers wore wrap-over coats decorated like chain mail with sleeves that narrowed at the wrists, these were often embroiled with flowers or plants.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 180\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 27\" /> Owen-Crocker explains that the belts of commanders were elaborate, wide, and fastened by \"a narrow strap which was riveted to the broad belt and passed through a buckle which was much narrower than the belt itself\" leaving the end of the belt to hang down.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 120\">{{harvnb|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=120}}.</ref>  Also attached to the belt were pouches which allowed soldiers to carry their weapons.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 120\" />  In the 9th and 10th centuries, military attire did not differ much from that of civil attire. The only changes were in the form of short linen tunics with metal collars and the addition of a sword, spear, shield, and helmet.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=41}} Weapons and clothes fittings worn on the battlefield were highly decorated with jewellery techniques, as seen in the discoveries at [[Sutton Hoo]] and in the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]; the concept of parade wear did not exist for the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n====Clergy====\nPlanch\u00e9 asserts that the clergy of the 9th and 10th centuries dressed similarly to the [[laity]], except when saying [[mass]]. Beginning in the later 8th century, the clergy were forbidden to wear bright colours or expensive or valuable fabrics.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=51\u201352}} Owen-Crocker mentions that their twill cloaks were generally shorter than those of the laity, reaching just below the waist, and Planch\u00e9 adds, that they wore linen stocking.<ref name=\"Owen-Crocker 178\" /><ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 34\" />\n\n===Eleventh century===\n\n====General attire====\nPlanch\u00e9 explains that in the 11th century, shortened tunics became popular as did shorter hair styles and beard lengths. Piercings also became fashionable for men as did golden bracelets.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=67}} During this era men continued to wear tunics, cloaks, and trousers which did not vary much from their previous counterparts. [[Coif]]s became popular head-coverings and appeared to be \"flat round cap[s]\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 71-72\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=71\u201372}}.</ref> Long stockings, with feet attached, were in style, and leg bandages and shoes continued to be worn. Short boots, those only extending to the ankle, were introduced in the latter part of the century.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 71-72\" />\n\n====Military attire====\n[[Image:Sutton Hoo helmet 2016.png|thumb|left|7th-century Anglo-Saxon helmet from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]\nMilitary attire was simply regular clothing with the addition of adornments depending on the number of \"marks\" a soldier had.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 61\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=61}}.</ref> These additions consisted of a spear, axe, sword, bow, shield, steel cap, helmet, an iron coat, or a linen or cloth tunic. During this era, soldiers carried either round or crescent shaped shields usually painted red. Higher-ranking officials decorated their swords with various colours and insignias.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=60\u201363}} In the middle half of the century, armor began to be made of leather and weapons were made light-weight. Previous mail tunics, found to be too heavy preventing the soldier from properly fighting, were replaced by the new leather armor, which consisted of overlapping flaps, cut like scales or leaves and each dyed a different colour.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=68}}\n\nIn the latter half of the century, warriors shaved their heads to resemble the clergy in order to confuse foreign spies.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 72\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=72}}.</ref> The [[cowl]], which was covered in rings, emerged during this time and was worn under the helmet, which also had a new addition, the nose piece. The ringed knee-length tunic was slit in the front and back to allow for more comfortable riding. The length of the trousers became shorter. \"Mascled armor\" began to replace the traditional ringed armory. These new iron pieces were assembled to look like mesh or nets but a combination of the two patterns have been found to be used. Another variation included covering the body in rings and removing the sleeves from the tunic. Planch\u00e9 mentions that a \"square pectoral\" was added to the breast of the armor as added protection and were \"quilted or covered with rings\".{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=77}} A yellow border was added to the pectorals, sleeves, and skirts. Shields had two new adjustments: one strap looped around the arm while a second strap circled around the neck, allowing the soldier the use of both his hands.{{sfn|Planch\u00e9|1847|pp=75\u201378}}\n\n====Clergy====\nThe clergy of the 11th century had shaved heads and wore [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]], which, according to Planch\u00e9, were \"slightly sinking in the centre, with the pendent ornaments of the [[mitre]] attached to the side of it\".<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 83\">{{harvnb|Planch\u00e9|1847|p=83}}.</ref> Other garments included the [[chasuble]], the outermost liturgical vestment, which retained its shape, and the [[dalmatic]]s, a tunic like vestment with large, bell shaped sleeves, which tended to be arched on the sides. The [[Crosier|pastoral staff]] was generally found to be plain in colour and ornamentation.<ref name=\"Planch\u00e9 83\" />\n\n===Twelfth century===\n{{main|1100\u20131200 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\nThe 12th century brought changes in the civil attire for the inhabitants of the British Isles.  The tunic was now close fitting with a long skirt. There was, as [[C. Willett Cunnington|C. Willett]] and [[Phillis Cunnington]] describe, a \"slit up in front to the thigh level\" and the sleeves, now close fitting, were \"bell-shaped\" at the wrist or, the \"lower portion [hung] to form a pendulous cuff which might be rolled up for action\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=28}}.</ref> Peasants wore tunics which were shorter and the sleeves were \"tubular\u2026[and] rolled back\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\" /> The tunic could be worn with or without the girdle, which now carried the sword. Neck lines were either diagonal, from the neck moving across the chest, or horizontal, from the neck to the shoulder. The super tunic, worn with a girdle, was occasionally worn alone but was never paired with the aforementioned tunic.  The sleeves of this super tunic had, as the Cunningtons state, \"pendulous cuffs\", which were uncommon, or were \"loose and often elbow-length only\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=31}}.</ref>  The super tunic was occasionally lined with fur.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 28\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\nThe cloak and mantle, a cloak resembling a loose cape, were fastened either with a brooch or clasp, or as the Cunningtons describe, \"the corner of the neck edge on one side was pulled through a ring sewn to the opposite corner, and then knotted to keep in position\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" /> For the rich, the cloak was lined with fur and for all classes beneath, the cloak was hooded and made of animal hide, with the hair facing out.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\n===Thirteenth century===\n{{main|1200\u20131300 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\nFor the first half of the 13th century, linen braies were worn and then shortened to the knee in the second half of the century, which then became drawers or undergarments. Short stockings ended just below the knee and the border was occasionally decorated. Longer stockings, mid thigh length, could also be worn: as [[C. Willett Cunnington|C. Willett]] and [[Phillis Cunnington]] say, they were \"shaped to fit the leg, widening above the knee so that they could be pulled up over the braies\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" /> The stockings and girdle were tied together at a point in the top front of the stocking by which to keep it in place. Some stockings had stirrups, whole feet, or no feet. For hosiery, made of wool or leather, a \"thin leather sole was attached\" so that shoes would not need to be worn.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />  Leg wear during the 12th century tended to be brightly coloured and stripes were popular.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 31\" />\n\nAll classes of men during the 12th century wore shoes or boots. Shoes, as the Cunningtons say, were \"open over the foot and fastened in front of the ankle with a strap secured by a brooch or buckle\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=33}}.</ref>  For the wealthy, the bands on shoes were decorated and designs were often found \"over the foot or around the heel\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Different styles of shoes began to appear during this era. One such, as the Cunningtons state, was \"high around the ankle and slit down the sides or in front\" while others were laced or had \"short uppers but cut high behind the heel\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Boots were most notably mid calf or knee length and laced down the front or along the inner side. These boots tended to be brightly coloured and had, in the Cunningtons' words, \"turn over tops\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Shorter boots, with pointed toes, were also worn and ended just above the ankle. Boots were made of leather from a cow or ox, cloth, fish skin, or, for those who could afford it, silk.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" />\n[[Image:13th century shoes.jpg|thumb|right|Shoes with ankle strap and open instep, 1250]]\nSeparate hoods also made an appearance. They were loose with, as the Cunningtons describe, a \"pointed cowl\" and were attached to a robe stretching to the shoulders.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> The cape was usually a single piece of material and thus had to be put on over the head. The Cunningtons state that the \"pointed Phrygian cap,\" or the \"small, round cap with stalk or with a rolled brim and with or without the stalk\" or the \"stalked soft cap, resembling a beret\" were worn.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33\" /> Travelers wore \"hats with large brims and low crowns\u2026over the hood\" which tied under the chin.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33-34\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref> Small hats with round crowns and, the Cunningtons say, \"turned-down brim, decorated with a knob instead of a stalk\" were also worn, as were coifs, which was a \"close fitting plain linen bonnet which covered the ears and confined the hair\" and tied under the chin.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=34}}.</ref> The coif could be worn with other hats or hoods.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 33-34\" />\n\nAccessories for 12th century English men became more decorated. The girdle, mid century, became more elaborate in its ornamentation and in the latter half of the century, was, \"tied like a sash in front with hanging ends\" or, if \"long and elaborate, was fastened with ornamental buckles\" as the Cunningtons depict.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\" /> Wallets and purses, in the early half of the century, were hung from the girdle or the breech girdle and in the latter half were placed under the tunic, out of sight. During this era gloves became fashionable for the nobility, although they were seldom worn. Rings, brooches, buckles, clasps, and \"ornamental fillets of gold and silver\", according to the Cunningtons, were worn by the ruling classes.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 35\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=35}}.</ref> Wool, linen, and silk continued to be used, as was leather, which the peasants used for tunics and mantle and left the hair on facing outward. Garments were also embroidered during this era.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 34\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 35\" />\n\nMen continued to wear both short and long tunics with a girdle; however the slit up the front was removed. A new style was introduced in this era in which the sleeves and body were cut from one piece of material. A wide armhole, which extended to the waist, was left open and the sleeves were cut in order to, as the Cunningtons state, \"slope off to a narrow tight cuff at the wrist\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=42}}.</ref>  The super tunic of the 11th century continued to be worn by the less fashionable, the lower classes of society, and the girdle was optional.\n\nFive new styles of the super tunic were introduced in this era. The first consisted of a front and back panel which extended from the shoulders to the calf level. The two panels were sewn together or clasped together near the waist, where they were met by a slit up the front. The neck opening was large so that the tunic could be put on over the head and a belt was not usually worn with this tunic. The second new style was more \"voluminous\" as the Cunningtons describe it, and hung in folds to a length between the knees and the ankles.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\" /> The sleeves gathered at the shoulders and extended beyond the hands. A vertical slit was cut in the upper arm of the sleeve to allow unrestrained movement. This garment, like the previous, was put on over the head and a hood was often attached. The third style was much looser than the previous ones. The sleeves could extended to just below the elbow or could be worn short and wide. A buckled belt was optional. The fourth super tunic, or garnache, was knee length and the material was cut wide at the shoulders to allow the material to \"fall down on each side, predicting cape-like sleeves,\" as the Cunningtons put it.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=44}}.</ref> The sides of this tunic could be clasped at the waist, sewn from the waist to the hem, or left open and was traditionally beltless. The last style was simply sleeveless and worn with a belt.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 42\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />  For these cloaks and hoods red, Irish cloth was popular.{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=63}}\n[[Image:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|thumb|right|Working man of the 13th century]] \nFitchets, resembling modern day pockets, also appeared in the 13th century. Vertical slits were cut in the super tunic, which did not have any side openings, to allow access to purse or keys slung from the girdle of the tunic.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />\n\nMen's headwear of the 13th century, as the Cunningtons illustrate, consisted of the hood, which was sometimes buttoned, and stalked round caps and large rimmed traveling hats, both seen in the previous century. New to this era were hats with \"round brim[s] turned up at the back which could be worn reversed with the turn-up in front\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=47}}.</ref> Hats with round crowns also made an appearance and were sometimes found with a \"knob on the crown\" or with a \"moderate brim with a downward slope or a rolled brim\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" />  The coif continued to be worn much more frequently.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" />\n\nDuring this era garments such as cloaks, mantles, and stockings remained unchanged. However, during this era, stockings were sometimes tied with narrow strips of material below the knee to hold the stocking in place. Leg bandages for the nobility became popular which criss-crossed and extended above the knee.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" />\n\nShoes during this era were designed so that each shoe was cut explicitly for an individual's foot. Shoes were plain, and most were closed around the ankle and were laced or buckled along the inner side of the foot. Other shoes exposed the top of the foot and either stretched high behind the ankle or were clasped near the ankle by an instep strap. Boots, as the Cunningtons describe, were briefly coloured along the top, had a much looser fit, and were barely extended to the calf.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 44\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> Calthrop adds that boots were \"turned over a little at the top\".{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=65}}\n\nMen's accessories were similar to those of the 11th century. Gloves continued to be worn by the nobility and could be long, stretching to the elbow, or short, wrist length, and began to be decorated, the Cunningtons explain, \"with a broad strip of gold embroidery down the back as far as the knuckles\".<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> By the end of the century, gloves were more widely worn and were ornamented with silver or [[Gilding|gilded]] buttons.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 47\" /> Calthrop also includes that long hair and neatly trimmed beards were in style for 13th century men.{{sfn|Calthrop|1906|p=64}}\n\n===Fourteenth century===\n{{main|1300\u20131400 in fashion}}\n\n====General attire====\n[[Image:Braies 14th century.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Undergarment|braies]] or underwear]]\nMen's clothing of the 14th century was much more form fitting than its 13th century counterparts. During this era, many of the standard pieces that had been worn by the Britons evolved into new garments and took on different names. P. Cunnington explains that loose garments, such as the tunic and super tunic, from previous centuries continued to be worn by the lower classes who were less concerned with fashion.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 20\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|1968|p=20}}.</ref> These loose garments, as C. Cunnington states, were slit up the front, had sleeves, and were worn with a girdle. In addition, they could be shortened to the hip.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 55\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=55}}.</ref>\nThe gipon, also called a pourpoint or doublet, emerged during the 14th century. It replaced the tunic and was knee length and close-fitting. The gipon was not designed with any folds or gathers as the tunic was. The sleeves were long and tight and the neck was low. The bodice was padded and the garment was either buttoned or laced down the front, but for the lower classes it was only buttoned to the waist.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 55\" /><ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|Cunnington|1969|p=57}}.</ref> The gipon was traditionally worn over a shirt and if worn with an outer garment, a belt was not worn.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 20\" /> At the end of the century, the gipon was shortened to above the mid-thigh and was worn with a belt at hip level <ref name=\" C. Cunnington 57\" />\n[[Image: Karl den store krons av leo III.jpg|thumb|right|The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] as depicted in the 14th century]]\nThe outer garment of this era was known as the cote-hardie and replaced the super tunic of previous centuries. This new low necked, knee length piece was tight fitting and buttoned or laced down the front to waist level, where it then \"flared into a full skirt which was open in the front\" as C. Cunnington describes.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\" /> The complex sleeves of the cote-hardie extended, in the front, to the elbow and, in back, hung in flaps which tapered and elongated. Sleeves during this era were decorated. A belt or girdle was worn with this new garment. The less fortunate wore looser core-hardies which did not fasten in the front. Instead, they were one piece and were put on over the head.<ref name=\"C. Cunnington 57\" /><ref>Phillis 20</ref> Cloaks and capes continued to be worn as outdoor wear and didn't change from the previous century.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\">{{harvnb|Cunnington|1968|p=21}}.</ref>\n\nMen's stockings of the 14th century were lengthened and tied to the region, so that it was hidden under the skirt. Shorter stockings were tied to garters with stripes of wool or linen. Shorter boots and shoes also become fashionable. Woolen soles were added to shoes as were straps.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\nThe hood continued to be worn by men during this era. However, its shape changed. The pointed cowl was lengthened as P. Cunnington describes, \"into a long streamer..and from this another head-dress was made which was made in the form of a turban with a fall-over flap made from the hood cape\".<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" /> Stalked caps remained popular and small hats with close, turned up brims emerged. Toward the end of the century men began putting feathers in their hats for decoration.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\nGloves spread amongst the social hierarchy so that even those of the working class were wearing them in the 14th century. For this class, only the thumb and two sections existed for the fingers.<ref name=\"P. Cunnington 21\" />\n\n==Clothing and class==\nThe lowest classes in the Middle Ages did not have access to the same clothing as nobility. Poor men and women working in the fields or wet or muddy conditions often went barefoot.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004}} Upper and middle-class women wore three garments and the third garment was either a [[surcoat]], [[bliaut]], or [[cotehardie]]. These were often lavish garments, depending on the wealth of the person wearing them, and could have trimmings in [[fur]] or silk decorated with elaborate designs. Because of the cost of fabric, the working classes hardly wore this third garment.\n[[Image:Brouche.jpg|thumb|left|13th-century peasant working barefoot in the fields]]\n\nAnother marker of the upper classes was an elaborate headdress. These could involve wires, draping fabric and pointed caps. Again, because of the cost the poor could not afford these and instead wore simple cloth veils called [[wimples]] that \"draped over the head, around the neck and up to the chin\".<ref name=\"Hell\">{{harvnb|Hell}}.</ref> Working women wore ankle length dresses and men wore short tunics and breeches. The longer the garment, the higher in station a person was. This is evident in the sumptuary laws of 1327 which states \"coming to the lowest class no serving man is to use 2\u00bd yards in a short gown or 3 in a long one\".{{sfn|Hooper|1915|p=433}} Also, serving men such as servants or attendants usually did not wear cloaks, and for the nobles who did it served to distinguish them from the masses.{{sfn|Owen-Crocker|2004|p=234}}\n[[Image:Bayeux-feast02.jpg|thumb|Example of serving men in short tunics and lacking cloaks]]\n\nWhile most of the peasant women wove their fabric and then made their own clothing, the wealthy were able to afford [[tailors]], [[furriers]], and embroiderers. The wealthiest, such as royalty, would have \"all these craftsmen on staff, sometimes one per each adult in the household\".<ref name=\"Hartman\">{{harvnb|Hartman|2001}}.</ref>\n\nSocial status was of the utmost importance during the Middle Ages, and this idea was exemplified through fashion. For example, it was generally understood that scarlet tones, such as red and purple, were important items in the wardrobes of royalty.{{sfn|Piponnier|Mane|1997|p=71}} More specifically, these colours became reserved for Kings and Princes, and denoted luxury and wealth. The medieval [[sumptuary law]]s or \"acts of apparel\" were put into place to regulate the clothing choices of people during that time.{{sfn|Scattergood|1987|p=256}} Those who supported the enactment of such laws did so because the laws emphasized the differences between the classes, and clearly defined what those differences are.{{sfn|Piponnier|Mane|1997|p=83}} For example, the 1363 statute to the Clothing Law of 1337 states that wives of [[yeomen]] and handicraftsmen may not wear any [[veil]] or [[kerchief]] made of silk...the higher-status groups, however, are allowed to wear whatever imported items they want.<ref>Sponsler 270\u2013271</ref> This clearly states the understood division between the rich and poor during this era, and the importance of keeping the classes defined as separate entities. There were rules for every item of clothing; lower-class women were banned from wearing expensive veils. Only wives and daughters of wealthy men could wear [[velvet]] or [[satin]].<ref>middle-ages.org.uk</ref> There was an unfair discontinuity in the rules; lower class citizens could never wear an item designated for the upper class, whereas the upper class could wear anything that suited them. For example, wives and daughters of servants were not to wear veils that cost more than twelve cents.<ref>middle-ages.org.uk/sumptuary-laws-middle-ages</ref>\n\nThe English sumptuary acts of 1363 go into explicit detail about clothing items which were reserved for those below the king's status, putting restrictions on coat length and shoe height.{{sfn|Scattergood|1987|p=261}} In this legislation, the intention was to prevent men from acting as if they were from a higher class by way of how they dressed. The laws specifically stated that a man was to dress within the status in which he was born.<ref>Sutton 17</ref> The acts depicted what clothing was to be worn and also clearly stated how the classes were ranked, with kings and royalty at the top and servants at the bottom. Most of these organized lists did not include all groups of people. The majority of the lists consisted of divisions of the upper and middle classes, while the lower classes were neglected altogether. This was because the middle class was considered most likely to violate the clothing laws because they were supposedly most influenced by social pressures, whereas lower-class people did not have the capabilities to dress according to a higher ranking even if they desired to do so.<ref>Sponsler 281</ref> In fact, any mention of lower classes was done so out of necessity in order to complete the social hierarchy.\n\n==Textiles used==\nThe most common material used was [[wool]], with the wool ranging in texture and quality based on the type of sheep it came from.{{efn|See, for example [[broadcloth]], [[fustian]].}} The quality could range from the very coarse and undyed for the lower class to extremely fine with designs and colour for the upper class. [[Linen]] and [[hemp]] were other fabrics used, and were utilized often by the lower classes as undergarments and head coverings. Also, [[silk]] was a popular material used by the wealthy and was imported from Asia. After the crusades, fabrics such as damasks, [[velvet]]s, and [[satin]] were brought back to England,<ref name=\"Hartman\"/> as was [[samite]]. Animal skins were also used such as \"sheep-skin cloaks\u2026  in winter to keep out the cold and rain\".<ref>\"Clothes\"</ref> [[Leather]] was used to produce items such as shoes, belts, gloves and armor.{{sfn|Newman|2001}}\n\nThe middle class could usually afford to dye their wool colours like blue and green. The wealthy could afford to add elaborate designs to their clothing as well as dying it red and black, expensive colours for the time.<ref name=\"Hartman\"/> Purple was also considered a colour of royalty and was reserved for kings or religious figures such as the [[pope]].<ref name=\"Hell\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[England]]\n*[[1100\u20131200 in fashion]]\n*[[1200\u20131300 in fashion]]\n*[[1300\u20131400 in fashion]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon dress]]\n*[[History of clothing and textiles]]\n*[[Early Middle Ages]]\n*[[High Middle Ages]]\n*[[Early medieval European dress]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon brooches]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web\n|last       = Alchin\n|first      = L.K.\n|title      = Sumptuary Laws of the Middle Ages\n|url        = http://www.lordsandladies.org/sumptuary-laws-middle-ages.htm\n|accessdate = 2009-04-15\n|website    = The Middle Ages Website\n}}\n*{{cite web\n|last       = Alchin\n|first      = L.

Initially a utilitarian garment, it first grew a long partly decorative tail behind called a [[liripipe]], and then developed into a complex, versatile and expensive headgear after what was originally the vertical opening for the face began to be used as a horizontal opening for the head.  It was especially fashionable in mid-15th century [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], before gradually falling out of fashion in the late 15th century and returning to its utilitarian status.  It is the most commonly worn male headgear in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], but its complicated construction is often misunderstood.\n\n==Humble origins==\n[[File:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|thumb|upright|left|The original form of chaperon, worn with the hood pulled back off the head.

A relatively simple wool chaperon, with ''bourrelet'', and ''cornette'' hanging forward.<ref name=\"LC\"/>]]\nThe chaperon began before 1200 as a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]] with a short [[cape]], put on by pulling over the head, or fastening at the front. The hood could be pulled off the head to hang behind, leaving the short cape round the neck and shoulders.  The edge of the cape was often trimmed, cut or scalloped for decorative effect. There were wool ones, used in cold weather, and lighter ones for summer.  In this form it continued through to the end of the Middle Ages, worn by the lower classes, often by women as well as men, and especially in Northern Europe. The hood was loose at the back, and sometimes ended in a tail that came to a point.\n\n==Terms and derivation==\n\nChaperon is a diminutive of ''chape'', which derives, like the English ''[[cap]]'', ''[[cape]]'' and ''[[cope]]'', from the [[Late Latin]] ''cappa'', which already could mean ''cap'', ''cape'' or ''hood'' ([[OED]]).\n\nThe tail of the hood, often quite long, was called the ''tippit''<ref name=\"SR\">SD Reed, ''From Chaperones to Chaplets:Aspects of Men's Headdress 1400\u20131519'', M.S.

The cape element was a '''patte''' in French and in English ''cape'', or sometimes ''cockscomb''<ref name=\"SR\"/> when fancily cut.  Later a round '''bourrelet''' (or ''rondel'') could form part of the assemblage.<ref name=\"LC\"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613205950/http://cleftlands.case.edu/hatskwcs1.pdf Constructing the Headdresses of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries], Paper by Marie Vibbert (Lyonnete Vibert), ''Known World Costume Symposium Proceedings'' (2005)</ref> Patte, cornette and bourrelet were the usual terms in the French of the 15th century Burgundian court, and are used here.<ref name=\"LC\"/>  In Italian the equivalent terms were '''foggia''', '''becchetto''', and '''mazzocchio'''.<ref name=\"frick\">Frick, Carole Collier.

But the word never appears in the [[Paston Letters]], where there are many references to ''hats'', ''hoods'' and ''bonnets'' for men.  As with all aspects of medieval costume, there are many contemporary images of clothing, and many mentions of names for clothing in contemporary documents, but definitively matching the names to the styles in the images is rarely possible.<ref name=\"SR\"/>  In Italian the word was '''cappuccio''' [kap'put:\u0283o], or its diminutive ''cappuccino'', from which come the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]], whose distinctive white hood and brown robe led to the [[Capuchin monkey|monkey]] and the type of [[Cappuccino|coffee]] being named after them (it also means the cap of a pen in Italian).\n\n''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' is ''Le Petit Chaperon rouge'' in the earliest published version, by [[Charles Perrault]], and French depictions of the story naturally favour the chaperon over the long riding-hood of ones in English.\n\nIn French ''chaperon'' was also the term in [[falconry]] for the hood placed over a hawk's head when held on the hand to stop it wanting to fly away.  It is either this or the headgear meaning that later extended figuratively to become [[Chaperone (social)|chaperon]] (in UK English, almost always ''chaperone'') meaning a protective escort, especially for a woman.\n\n==Using the wrong hole==\n[[File:Philip the good.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]] after [[Rogier van der Weyden]], c. 1450, has an unusually large ''bourrelet'', surely hollow, worn in style D.]]\n\nAbout 1300 the chaperon began to be worn by putting the hole intended for the face over the top of the head instead; perhaps in hot weather.  This left the ''cornette'' tail and the cape or ''patte'',  hanging loose from the top of the head.  This became fashionable, and  chaperons began to be made to be worn in this style.  Some authorities only use the term chaperon for this type, calling the earlier forms hoods \u2013 which was certainly their usual name in English.  This is a categorisation for modern discussions only; there is no dispute over whether chaperon was the contemporary term.  See the wearing ''Colley-Weston-ward'' of the [[mandilion]] for an analogous development in a type of coat.\n\nA padded  circular '''bourrelet''' (or ''rondel'') evolved, which sat around the head, whilst the ''cornette'' became much longer, and gradually more scarf-like in shape, until by the 1430s it was usually straight at the sides and square-ended. Especially in Italy, the cornette was sometimes dispensed with, leaving just an un-flared tubular patte fixed to the bourrelet all round and hanging down to one side of the head. Reed (see refs) calls these ''sack hats''.<ref name=\"SR\"/>\n\nBy 1400\u201316, the period of the famous [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the ''Livre de Chasse'' of [[Gaston Phoebus]] ([[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris]] Ms Fran\u00e7ais 616), and the  ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' chaperons are to be seen worn by many figures. In the famous Calendar scenes of the ''Tr\u00e9s Riches Heures'', they are worn in the original form by the peasants working in the fields, both men and women (February, March and September), and huntsmen (December), and in the new form by some of the courtiers (January and May), who wear coloured and scalloped ones, probably of silk.  However, the Duke himself, and the most prominent courtiers, do not wear them. In the ''Livre de Chasse'' they are most often worn by the lower huntsmen on foot in the original form, though they and mounted hunters also wear them on top of the head. Figures often have a hood chaperon and a hat as well. Only the original form (trimmed with fur in one case - fol.51V) is worn by the very highest-ranking figures.  [http://classes.bnf.fr/phebus/pistes/index6.htm]\n\nBy the 1430s most chaperons had become simpler in the treatment of the cloth, and the cornette is long and plain, although the patte may still be elaborately treated with dagging. A perhaps overdressed courtier in a Van der Weyden workshop ''Exhumation of St Hubert'' ([[National Gallery, London]] NG 783) from this decade still has a very elaborately cut and dagged patte.<ref name=\"LC\"/> A figure behind him is wearing his in church, which is unusual (both figures can be paralleled in the ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece]]''; see Gallery below).\n\n==Evolved chaperon==\n[[File:690px-Rogier van der Weyden- Seven Sacraments Chaperon detail edited.jpg|thumb|180px|The carried chaperon (style F) of the lower man shows clearly (from bottom) the ''patte'', ''bourrelet'' and ''cornette''. The man above has a much larger ''bourrelet'' and his ''patte'' tied under the chin (1445\u201350, detail from gallery).]]\nBy the middle of the 15th century the evolved chaperon (worn on top of the head, with bourrelet) had become common wear for males in the upper and middle classes, and were worn in painted portraits, including those of the Dukes of Burgundy.  The amount of cloth involved had become considerable, and although chaperons seem to have normally been of a single colour at this period, a silk or damask one would have been a conspicuous sign of affluence. A Florentine chaperon of 1515 is recorded as using sixteen ''braccia'' of cloth, over ten yards (9 metres).<ref>Carole Collier Frick, Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing, p 231, 2002, Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-6939-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801869390]</ref> \nChaperons are nearly always shown in art as plain-coloured at this period, but painting a patterned one would have been a daunting task.\n\nThe cornette now stretched nearly to the ground, and the patte had also grown slightly; both were now plain and undecorated by cutting or dagging at the edges.  Bourrelets could be very large, or quite modest; some were clearly made round a hollow framework (a drawing survives of an Italian block for making them).<ref name=\"LC\"/> The largest bourrelets are worn by very high ranking men around 1445\u201350.  Sometimes they seem to be just a ring (the [[doughnut]] analogy is hard to resist) with an open centre, and sometimes the opening seems to be at least partly covered with fixed cloth. Because the bourrelets were usually the same shape all the way round, several different parts of it could be worn facing forward.  Probably for this reason, chaperons are rarely seen adorned by badges or jewellery.  There were now many ways of wearing, and indeed carrying, this most complex and adaptable of hats:\n\n*A) the cornette and patte could be tied together on top of the head, to create a flamboyant turban-like effect, sometimes with a short tail of cornette or patte hanging to the rear.\n*B) the patte could be looped under the chin and tied or pinned to the bourrelet on the other side of the face, whilst the cornette hung behind or in front, or was tied on top.\n*C) the patte could be worn to the loose to the rear, with the cornette tied on top, or hanging loose to front or rear.\n*D) conversely the patte could be tied above, whilst the cornette hung loose to front or rear.\n*E) the patte could be worn to the rear, loose or tucked into the other clothes at the back of the neck, whilst the cornette was wrapped round over the top of the head and under the chin a couple of times and secured.  This was suitable for cold or windy weather, especially when riding.\n*F) when the chaperon needed to be removed, in warm weather, or in the presence of a person much higher in rank (and, usually, in church) it could be put over the shoulder with the patte and cornette hanging on opposite sides, or round the shoulders.  Which came forward and which went back varies considerably, but more often the bourrelet went behind.  Possibly the chaperon was secured to the shoulder, as the assemblage often looks rather precarious.  [[Donor portrait|Donor figures]] in religious paintings always wear their chaperons in this way, as they are figuratively in the presence of the saints or the Madonna.\n\nExamples of these styles are shown in the illustrations to the article and in the Gallery section below.\n\n==The height of fashion==\n[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Presentation Miniature, Chroniques de Hainaut KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|360px|Miniature by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1447\u20138). ''[[Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good|Philip the Good of Burgundy and courtiers]]'' (styles B and F; see text)]]\nThe [[Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good|only surviving manuscript miniature]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] shows Philip the Good wearing a chaperon in style B. Next to him stands Chancellor [[Nicolas Rolin]], using a less exuberant version of style B; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the [[Bishop of Tournai]], next to Rolin, all the other men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, despite the fact that several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. But as far as can be seen, all have hats.  The man in grey seems to be carrying another sort of hat, but all the other ones visible are chaperons worn in style F, mostly with the cornettes to the front. The young [[Charles the Bold]] has his patte wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right has his bourrelet further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging down from it.

The factions themselves were also sometimes known as chaperons.  During the captivity in England of King [[John II of France]] in 1356, the participants in a popular uprising in Paris against his son, the future [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], wore parti-coloured chaperons of red, for [[Paris]], and blue for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] as they supported the claim to the French throne of King [[Charles II of Navarre|Charles the Bad of Navarre]].    In 1379 the ever-difficult citizens of [[Ghent]] rose up against [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke Philip the Bold of Burgundy]] wearing white chaperons.  White was also worn in factional disturbances in Paris in 1413, by opponents of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]], during one of King [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI's]] bouts of madness.<ref>M-N Bouillet, A Chassang, ''Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de g\u00e9ographie contenant l'histoire proprement dite, la biographie universelle, la mythologie, la g\u00e9ographie ancienne et moderne'', Hachette, Paris, 1878</ref>\n\nThe chaperon was one of the items of male clothing that featured in the charges brought against [[Joan of Arc]] at her trial in 1431.<ref>Many references throughout the proceedings (often translated as \"hat\" in English versions).

It is of course always winter, when the chaperon was most likely to be worn.  [[Saint Joseph]] is especially useful, as it is never part of his depiction to be fashionably dressed, and it is part of his character in the period that he is often shown quite dishevelled (see examples below).  The shepherds are the lower-class figures most often shown in a large scale in paintings of the period.\n\n==Decline==\nBy about 1480 the chaperon was ceasing to be fashionable, but continued to be worn.<ref name=\"SR\"/>  The size of the bourrelet was reduced, and the patte undecorated.  St Joseph could, by this stage, often be seen with the evolved form. By 1500 the evolved chaperon was definitely outmoded in Northern Europe, but the original hood form still remained a useful headgear for shepherds and peasants.  By this time the evolved chaperon had become fixed in some forms of civilian [[uniform]]s for lawyers, academics and the members of some knightly orders, such as the Order of the Garter. In these uses it gradually shrank in size and often became permanently attached to the clothing underneath, effectively just as an ornament, in its present form, as a part of academic dress, called an [[epitoge]].  In Italy it remained more current, more as a dignified form of headgear for older men, until about the 1520s.\n\n==Funerary ornaments on horses==\nIn a later related use of the term, the name {{lang|fr|chaperoon}} passed to certain little [[shield]]s, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]], and other [[funeral]] devices, placed on the foreheads of horses that drew the [[hearse]]s to processional funerals. These were called {{lang|fr|chaperoons}} or ''shafferoons'', as they were originally fastened to the ''chaperonnes'', or hoods, worn by those horses with their other coverings of state.<ref>1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]], a publication in the public domain.</ref>  (See also [[Frentera]].)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Hennequin und Herman von) Br\u00fcder (Pol Limburg 006.jpg|''[[Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', January (detail), c. 1410.

Initially a utilitarian garment, it first grew a long partly decorative tail behind called a [[liripipe]], and then developed into a complex, versatile and expensive headgear after what was originally the vertical opening for the face began to be used as a horizontal opening for the head.  It was especially fashionable in mid-15th century [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], before gradually falling out of fashion in the late 15th century and returning to its utilitarian status.

The hood could be pulled off the head to hang behind, leaving the short cape round the neck and shoulders.  The edge of the cape was often trimmed, cut or scalloped for decorative effect. There were wool ones, used in cold weather, and lighter ones for summer.  In this form it continued through to the end of the Middle Ages, worn by the lower classes, often by women as well as men, and especially in Northern Europe. The hood was loose at the back, and sometimes ended in a tail that came to a point.\n\n==Terms and derivation==\n\nChaperon is a diminutive of ''chape'', which derives, like the English ''[[cap]]'', ''[[cape]]'' and ''[[cope]]'', from the [[Late Latin]] ''cappa'', which already could mean ''cap'', ''cape'' or ''hood'' ([[OED]]).\n\nThe tail of the hood, often quite long, was called the ''tippit''<ref name=\"SR\">SD Reed, ''From Chaperones to Chaplets:Aspects of Men's Headdress 1400\u20131519'', M.S.

But the word never appears in the [[Paston Letters]], where there are many references to ''hats'', ''hoods'' and ''bonnets'' for men.  As with all aspects of medieval costume, there are many contemporary images of clothing, and many mentions of names for clothing in contemporary documents, but definitively matching the names to the styles in the images is rarely possible.<ref name=\"SR\"/>  In Italian the word was '''cappuccio''' [kap'put:\u0283o], or its diminutive ''cappuccino'', from which come the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]], whose distinctive white hood and brown robe led to the [[Capuchin monkey|monkey]] and the type of [[Cappuccino|coffee]] being named after them (it also means the cap of a pen in Italian).\n\n''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' is ''Le Petit Chaperon rouge'' in the earliest published version, by [[Charles Perrault]], and French depictions of the story naturally favour the chaperon over the long riding-hood of ones in English.\n\nIn French ''chaperon'' was also the term in [[falconry]] for the hood placed over a hawk's head when held on the hand to stop it wanting to fly away.  It is either this or the headgear meaning that later extended figuratively to become [[Chaperone (social)|chaperon]] (in UK English, almost always ''chaperone'') meaning a protective escort, especially for a woman.\n\n==Using the wrong hole==\n[[File:Philip the good.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]] after [[Rogier van der Weyden]], c. 1450, has an unusually large ''bourrelet'', surely hollow, worn in style D.]]\n\nAbout 1300 the chaperon began to be worn by putting the hole intended for the face over the top of the head instead; perhaps in hot weather.  This left the ''cornette'' tail and the cape or ''patte'',  hanging loose from the top of the head.  This became fashionable, and  chaperons began to be made to be worn in this style.  Some authorities only use the term chaperon for this type, calling the earlier forms hoods \u2013 which was certainly their usual name in English.  This is a categorisation for modern discussions only; there is no dispute over whether chaperon was the contemporary term.  See the wearing ''Colley-Weston-ward'' of the [[mandilion]] for an analogous development in a type of coat.\n\nA padded  circular '''bourrelet''' (or ''rondel'') evolved, which sat around the head, whilst the ''cornette'' became much longer, and gradually more scarf-like in shape, until by the 1430s it was usually straight at the sides and square-ended. Especially in Italy, the cornette was sometimes dispensed with, leaving just an un-flared tubular patte fixed to the bourrelet all round and hanging down to one side of the head. Reed (see refs) calls these ''sack hats''.<ref name=\"SR\"/>\n\nBy 1400\u201316, the period of the famous [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the ''Livre de Chasse'' of [[Gaston Phoebus]] ([[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris]] Ms Fran\u00e7ais 616), and the  ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' chaperons are to be seen worn by many figures. In the famous Calendar scenes of the ''Tr\u00e9s Riches Heures'', they are worn in the original form by the peasants working in the fields, both men and women (February, March and September), and huntsmen (December), and in the new form by some of the courtiers (January and May), who wear coloured and scalloped ones, probably of silk.  However, the Duke himself, and the most prominent courtiers, do not wear them. In the ''Livre de Chasse'' they are most often worn by the lower huntsmen on foot in the original form, though they and mounted hunters also wear them on top of the head. Figures often have a hood chaperon and a hat as well. Only the original form (trimmed with fur in one case - fol.51V) is worn by the very highest-ranking figures.  [http://classes.bnf.fr/phebus/pistes/index6.htm]\n\nBy the 1430s most chaperons had become simpler in the treatment of the cloth, and the cornette is long and plain, although the patte may still be elaborately treated with dagging. A perhaps overdressed courtier in a Van der Weyden workshop ''Exhumation of St Hubert'' ([[National Gallery, London]] NG 783) from this decade still has a very elaborately cut and dagged patte.<ref name=\"LC\"/> A figure behind him is wearing his in church, which is unusual (both figures can be paralleled in the ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece]]''; see Gallery below).\n\n==Evolved chaperon==\n[[File:690px-Rogier van der Weyden- Seven Sacraments Chaperon detail edited.jpg|thumb|180px|The carried chaperon (style F) of the lower man shows clearly (from bottom) the ''patte'', ''bourrelet'' and ''cornette''. The man above has a much larger ''bourrelet'' and his ''patte'' tied under the chin (1445\u201350, detail from gallery).]]\nBy the middle of the 15th century the evolved chaperon (worn on top of the head, with bourrelet) had become common wear for males in the upper and middle classes, and were worn in painted portraits, including those of the Dukes of Burgundy.  The amount of cloth involved had become considerable, and although chaperons seem to have normally been of a single colour at this period, a silk or damask one would have been a conspicuous sign of affluence. A Florentine chaperon of 1515 is recorded as using sixteen ''braccia'' of cloth, over ten yards (9 metres).<ref>Carole Collier Frick, Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing, p 231, 2002, Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-6939-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801869390]</ref> \nChaperons are nearly always shown in art as plain-coloured at this period, but painting a patterned one would have been a daunting task.\n\nThe cornette now stretched nearly to the ground, and the patte had also grown slightly; both were now plain and undecorated by cutting or dagging at the edges.  Bourrelets could be very large, or quite modest; some were clearly made round a hollow framework (a drawing survives of an Italian block for making them).<ref name=\"LC\"/> The largest bourrelets are worn by very high ranking men around 1445\u201350.  Sometimes they seem to be just a ring (the [[doughnut]] analogy is hard to resist) with an open centre, and sometimes the opening seems to be at least partly covered with fixed cloth. Because the bourrelets were usually the same shape all the way round, several different parts of it could be worn facing forward.  Probably for this reason, chaperons are rarely seen adorned by badges or jewellery.  There were now many ways of wearing, and indeed carrying, this most complex and adaptable of hats:\n\n*A) the cornette and patte could be tied together on top of the head, to create a flamboyant turban-like effect, sometimes with a short tail of cornette or patte hanging to the rear.\n*B) the patte could be looped under the chin and tied or pinned to the bourrelet on the other side of the face, whilst the cornette hung behind or in front, or was tied on top.\n*C) the patte could be worn to the loose to the rear, with the cornette tied on top, or hanging loose to front or rear.\n*D) conversely the patte could be tied above, whilst the cornette hung loose to front or rear.\n*E) the patte could be worn to the rear, loose or tucked into the other clothes at the back of the neck, whilst the cornette was wrapped round over the top of the head and under the chin a couple of times and secured.  This was suitable for cold or windy weather, especially when riding.\n*F) when the chaperon needed to be removed, in warm weather, or in the presence of a person much higher in rank (and, usually, in church) it could be put over the shoulder with the patte and cornette hanging on opposite sides, or round the shoulders.  Which came forward and which went back varies considerably, but more often the bourrelet went behind.  Possibly the chaperon was secured to the shoulder, as the assemblage often looks rather precarious.  [[Donor portrait|Donor figures]] in religious paintings always wear their chaperons in this way, as they are figuratively in the presence of the saints or the Madonna.\n\nExamples of these styles are shown in the illustrations to the article and in the Gallery section below.\n\n==The height of fashion==\n[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Presentation Miniature, Chroniques de Hainaut KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|360px|Miniature by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1447\u20138).

Next to him stands Chancellor [[Nicolas Rolin]], using a less exuberant version of style B; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the [[Bishop of Tournai]], next to Rolin, all the other men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, despite the fact that several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. But as far as can be seen, all have hats.  The man in grey seems to be carrying another sort of hat, but all the other ones visible are chaperons worn in style F, mostly with the cornettes to the front. The young [[Charles the Bold]] has his patte wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right has his bourrelet further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging down from it. Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.<ref name=\"IR\">T Kren & S McKendrick (eds), ''Illuminating the Renaissance - The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe'', Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, {{ISBN|1-903973-28-7}}</ref>\n\nThe chaperon never became quite this dominant in Italy or France; nor does it seem to have been worn as often by grand personages, although this is sometimes the case.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2005/miniature/zoomify/miniature_195714614a.shtm |title=Medal by &#91;&#91;Pisanello&#93;&#93;of Don I\u00f1igo d'Avalos, d. 1484, Grand Chamberlain of Naples from 1442, Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=2006-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108014145/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2005/miniature/zoomify/miniature_195714614a.shtm |archive-date=2010-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  There is a famous bust of [[Lorenzo de Medici]] wearing one, although in this he may be deliberately avoiding ostentatious dress (see gallery section).

In England, on the other hand, almost all the non-royal members of the [[Order of the Garter]] are shown wearing them in their portraits in the \"Bruges Garter Book\" of 1430\u20131440 ([[British Library]], MS Stowe 594).<ref>See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:British_Library,_Stowe_594 the images on Wikimedia Commons]</ref> In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] they were generally less common, & appeared lower down the social scale.<ref name=\"SR\"/> They were apparently never worn by the clergy anywhere.<ref name=\"SR\"/>\n\n==Political chaperons==\nChaperons were used in France and Burgundy to denote, by their colour, allegiance to a political faction.  The factions themselves were also sometimes known as chaperons.  During the captivity in England of King [[John II of France]] in 1356, the participants in a popular uprising in Paris against his son, the future [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], wore parti-coloured chaperons of red, for [[Paris]], and blue for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] as they supported the claim to the French throne of King [[Charles II of Navarre|Charles the Bad of Navarre]].    In 1379 the ever-difficult citizens of [[Ghent]] rose up against [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Duke Philip the Bold of Burgundy]] wearing white chaperons.  White was also worn in factional disturbances in Paris in 1413, by opponents of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]], during one of King [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI's]] bouts of madness.<ref>M-N Bouillet, A Chassang, ''Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de g\u00e9ographie contenant l'histoire proprement dite, la biographie universelle, la mythologie, la g\u00e9ographie ancienne et moderne'', Hachette, Paris, 1878</ref>\n\nThe chaperon was one of the items of male clothing that featured in the charges brought against [[Joan of Arc]] at her trial in 1431.<ref>Many references throughout the proceedings (often translated as \"hat\" in English versions).

It is of course always winter, when the chaperon was most likely to be worn.  [[Saint Joseph]] is especially useful, as it is never part of his depiction to be fashionably dressed, and it is part of his character in the period that he is often shown quite dishevelled (see examples below).  The shepherds are the lower-class figures most often shown in a large scale in paintings of the period.\n\n==Decline==\nBy about 1480 the chaperon was ceasing to be fashionable, but continued to be worn.<ref name=\"SR\"/>  The size of the bourrelet was reduced, and the patte undecorated.  St Joseph could, by this stage, often be seen with the evolved form. By 1500 the evolved chaperon was definitely outmoded in Northern Europe, but the original hood form still remained a useful headgear for shepherds and peasants.  By this time the evolved chaperon had become fixed in some forms of civilian [[uniform]]s for lawyers, academics and the members of some knightly orders, such as the Order of the Garter. In these uses it gradually shrank in size and often became permanently attached to the clothing underneath, effectively just as an ornament, in its present form, as a part of academic dress, called an [[epitoge]].  In Italy it remained more current, more as a dignified form of headgear for older men, until about the 1520s.\n\n==Funerary ornaments on horses==\nIn a later related use of the term, the name {{lang|fr|chaperoon}} passed to certain little [[shield]]s, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]], and other [[funeral]] devices, placed on the foreheads of horses that drew the [[hearse]]s to processional funerals. These were called {{lang|fr|chaperoons}} or ''shafferoons'', as they were originally fastened to the ''chaperonnes'', or hoods, worn by those horses with their other coverings of state.<ref>1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]], a publication in the public domain.</ref>  (See also [[Frentera]].)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Hennequin und Herman von) Br\u00fcder (Pol Limburg 006.jpg|''[[Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', January (detail), c. 1410.

Today, the term most frequently refers to a garment that wraps around a woman's [[breast]]s.<ref name=OED/> It is usually part of a [[bikini]] in sports or [[swimwear]], but is now also accepted as the top part of [[formal wear]] when worn with pants or a skirt.

Bandeaus are commonly made from [[Elastomer|elastic material]] to stop them from slipping down, or are tied or pinned at the back or front. In the first half of the 20th century, a \"bandeau\" was a narrow band worn by women to bind the hair, or as part of a head-dress.<ref name=OED>{{OED|bandeau|id=15133}} Used for headband from 1706, for brassiere from 1915.</ref>\n\n==Contemporary uses==\n\n===Modern swimwear===\nThe bandeau emerged as the top part of a two-piece swimsuit during the 1940s. In the 1950s the bandeau incorporated foundation so as to structure (or improve) the contours of the body, while still retaining a relatively simple circle or band shape, emphasizing the bare [[midriff]]. Another variation of bandeau is a one-piece bandeau swimsuit that covers the mid-section of the body.<ref>[https://www.biqiniz.com/pages/biqiniz-glossary Biqiniz Bikini Glossary] Know your bandeaus from your halters.</ref> Its popularity in swimwear declined during the string bikini era, but it reappeared in the 1980s, especially with Spandex and other stretch fabric blends.

It may be fastened in the front or back or be sufficiently elastic so as not to need a fastener at all. A bandeau may come with a detachable [[Halterneck|halter]] strap, for extra support. A strapless bandeau, or [[tube top]], was also worn as casual wear and sports wear starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes worn as part of a sportswear ensemble.<ref name=bikiniscience>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikiniscience.com/costumes/soutien-gorge_SS/bandeau_S/bandeau.html |title=Bandeau |work=Bikini Science |accessdate=2009-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422152422/http://www.bikiniscience.com/costumes/soutien-gorge_SS/bandeau_S/bandeau.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In formal wear===\nActress [[Halle Berry]] wore a bandeau with matching pants to the [[MTV Video Music Award|VMAs]], fueling the trend of wearing a bandeau top as an out-of-home dress.<ref>\"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF3D12ADCEAD559&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Heat relief, what suits are hot \u2013 from tops to bottoms]\", ''San Jose Mercury News'', page 1E, 2001-06-08</ref> [[Miley Cyrus]] also wore a cropped bandeau top with high waisted pants at the 2014 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]<ref>U.S. weekly, 24 August 2014: [http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/miley-cyrus-arrives-2014248 Miley Cyrus Looks Sophisticated, Wears Black Bandeau and Leather Pants One Year After 2013 VMAs]</ref> and British model [[Jourdan Dunn]] wore a black bandeau top with a matching maxiskirt.<ref>Daily Mail, 24 August 2014: [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2733654/Jourdan-Dunn-crops-abs-revealing-bandeau-MTV-VMAs-help-checking-Amber-Roses-curvy-derriere.html Jourdan Dunn is top of the crops in abs revealing bandeau top at MTV VMAs... but she can't help checking out Amber Rose's curvy derriere]</ref> The outfits consisted of a bandeau top and a high waisted bottom, covering the navel.\n\n==History==\n\n=== In antiquity ===\n[[File:Mosa\u00efque des bikinis, Piazza Armerina.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Roman [[Villa Romana del Casale]] (286\u2013305 AD) in [[Sicily]] contains one of the earliest known illustrations of a [[bikini]].]]\n\nWearing a bandeau to support a woman's breasts may date back to [[ancient Greece]],<ref name=HISTORY>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Jacquelyn|title=The History of Lingerie [INFOGRAPHIC]|url=http://blog.herroom.com/infographic/history-lingerie-infographic/|publisher=HerRoom|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> where they were called ''apodesmos'' ({{lang-el|\u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)po%2Fdesmo \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>), later ''st\u0113thodesm\u0113'' (Gr: \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03bc\u03b7<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsthqode%2Fsmh \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03bc\u03b7], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>), ''mastodesmos'' (Gr: \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmasto%2Fdesmos \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) and ''mastodeton'' (Gr: \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmasto%2Fdeton \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>), all meaning \"breast-band\".

Pattens were worn outdoors over a normal shoe, had a wooden or later wood and metal [[Sole (shoe)|sole]], and were held in place by [[leather]] or [[cloth]] bands. Pattens functioned to elevate the foot above the [[mud]] and dirt (including human [[effluent]] and animal [[Feces|dung]]) of the street, in a period when [[road]] and [[City|urban]] paving was minimal.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word ''patten'' probably derives from the [[Old French]] ''patte'' meaning hoof or paw.<ref>{{cite OED|patten|id=138966}}</ref>\n\nWomen continued to wear pattens in muddy conditions until the nineteenth or even early 20th century.  In appearance, they may resemble contemporary [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]] or [[Sandal (footwear)|sandals]], but though historical usage was apparently not always consistent, the term now is used only to describe protective overshoes worn over another pair of shoes.\n\n==Medieval period==\nPattens were worn during the [[Middle Ages]] outdoors and in public places over (outside) the thin [[Sole (shoe)|soled]] [[shoe]]s of that [[era]]. Pattens were worn by both men and women during the [[Middle Ages]], and are especially seen in art from the [[1400-1500 in fashion|15th century]]: a time when [[poulaine]]s, shoes with very long pointed toes, were particularly in fashion. \n<br />Medieval pattens were known in English by the terms: 'patyns', 'clogges', and 'galoches', but the original shades of meaning and distinction between these terms is now unclear.<ref name=\"Grew & De Neergaard\">Grew, F & De Neergaard, M: Shoes and Pattens'2001.</ref> Medieval and Early Modern overshoes are now all usually referred to as 'pattens' for convenience.\n\n===Types===\n\nThere were three main types of pattens: one with a wooden 'platform' sole raised from the ground by either with wooden wedges or iron stands. The second variant had a flat wooden sole often [[hinge]]d. The third type had a flat sole made from stacked layers of [[leather]]. Some later European varieties of these pattens had a laminated sole: light wooden inner sections with leather above and below. In earlier varieties of pattens, dating from the 12th century on, the [[stilts|stilt]] or wedge variety were more common. From the late 14th century, the flat variety became increasingly common. Leather pattens became fashionable in the 14th and 15th centuries, and in London appear to have begun to be worn as shoes over hose in the 15th century, spreading to a much wider section of the public.<ref name=\"Grew & De Neergaard\"/> Most London patten soles were constructed of [[alder]], [[willow]] or [[Populus|poplar]] [[wood]]s.<ref name=\"Grew & De Neergaard\"/>\n\nIn 1390, the [[Diocese of York]] forbade [[clergy]] from wearing pattens and clogs in both church and in processions, considering them to be indecorous: \"''contra honestatem ecclesiae''\".<ref>[[OED]] despite quotation being in Latin: \"clogges et pattenes\"</ref> Conversely, the famous Spanish [[rabbi]] [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Solomon ben Abraham Ibn Adret]], \"the Rashba\", (c. 1233 \u2013 c. 1310) was asked if it was permissible to wear \"patines\" on [[Shabbat]], to which he replied that it was the custom of \"all the wise in the land\" to wear them, and certainly permitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing.htm |title=Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

Furthermore, [[refuse]] in cities \u2013 animal especially horse [[Feces|dung]] and human [[effluent]] (from [[chamber pot]]s)\u2013 was usually thrown directly into the street (often with minimal advance warning). Making full foot contact with such an unpleasant surface was, understandably, highly undesirable. Thus, pattens tended to only make contact with the ground through two or three strips of wood and raised the wearer up considerably, sometimes by four inches (ten centimetres) or more in contrast to [[clogs]] which usually have a low, flat-bottomed [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] integral to the shoe.\n\n==Early Modern period==\n[[File:1773 patten.png|thumb|left|240px|A maid wearing circle-type pattens: ''Piety in Pattens or Timbertoe on Tiptoe'', England 1773]]\nA later pattern of patten which seems to date from the 17th century, and then became the most common, had a flat metal ring which made contact with the ground, attached to a metal plate nailed into the wooden sole via connecting metal, often creating a platform of by several inches (more than 7 centimetres).<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Children's pattens made in Montgomery, 19th century\n |publisher   = Gathering the Jewels\n |url         = http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20661\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082509/http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20661\n |archivedate = 10 October 2007\n}}</ref> By this time men's shoes had thicker soles and the wealthier males (the [[gentry]] or [[gentlemen]]) commonly wore high [[riding boot]]s, thus pattens seem only to have been worn by women and [[working-class]] men in outdoor occupations.

[[Samuel Pepys]] recorded in his diary for 24 January 1660:\n\n{{quote|Called on my wife and took her to Mrs Pierce's, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow.}}\n\nFrom the ''Middle Period'' Poems of [[John Clare]] (1820s):\n::{{quote|      She lost her pattens in the muck\n:& Roger in his mind\n:Considered her misfortune luck\n:To show her he was kind\n:He over hitops fetched it out\n:& cleaned it for her foot...}}\n(\"hitops\" are high boots)\n\nFrom [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[The Woodlanders]]'' of 1887, though set earlier in the century:\n\n{{quote|he saw before him the trim figure of a young woman in pattens, journeying with that steadfast concentration which means purpose and not pleasure. He was soon near enough to see that she was Marty South. Click, click, click went the pattens; and she did not turn her head.\n\nShe had, however, become aware before this that the driver of the approaching gig was Giles. She had shrunk from being overtaken by him thus; but as it was inevitable, she had braced herself up for his inspection by closing her lips so as to make her mouth quite unemotional, and by throwing an additional firmness into her tread.\n\n\"Why do you wear pattens, Marty? The turnpike is clean enough, although the lanes are muddy.\"\n\n\"They save my boots.\"\n\n\"But twelve miles in pattens\u2014'twill twist your feet off. Come, get up and ride with me.\"\n\nShe hesitated, removed her pattens, knocked the gravel out of them against the wheel, and mounted in front of the nodding specimen apple-tree.}}\n\n==Other uses of the term==\nThe word could also be used as a term for a wooden soled shoe, that is a [[chopine]] or [[clog (shoe)|clog]], as opposed to an overshoe, until at least the nineteenth century.  The word was also used for the traditional wooden outdoor shoes of [[Japan]] and other Asian countries.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =Pair of Pattens\n  | publisher =Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery\n  | url =http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973A1120\n  }}</ref> What are in effect [[snowshoe]]s for mud, as used by [[wildfowler]]s, boatmen, and [[Coast Guard]]s may also be called pattens, or \"mud-pattens\".  These are shaped boards attached to the sole of a shoe, which extend sideways well beyond the shape of the foot, and therefore are a different sort of footwear from the patten discussed here. \"Horse-pattens\" were used on horses, especially for [[plough]]ing muddy fields.  The word was also used for [[ice skating|ice-skate]]s, as it is in French (''patiner'', to skate).\n\n==The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers==\nIn [[London]], the [[Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers]] remains the [[Livery Company]], formerly [[guild]] of the Patten-makers, or Patteners, and their adopted church remains [[St Margaret Pattens]].  The first record of the guild dates to 1379, and there was still a pattenmaker listed in a London Trade Directory in the 1920s.  A notice, probably 18th century, in the Guild Church still requests ladies to remove their pattens on entering; other English churches have similar signs, and in one case, a board with pegs for ladies to hang them on.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Walraversijde49.jpg|Excavated Dutch pattens, c. 1465.

[[Samuel Pepys]] recorded in his diary for 24 January 1660:\n\n{{quote|Called on my wife and took her to Mrs Pierce's, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow.}}\n\nFrom the ''Middle Period'' Poems of [[John Clare]] (1820s):\n::{{quote|      She lost her pattens in the muck\n:& Roger in his mind\n:Considered her misfortune luck\n:To show her he was kind\n:He over hitops fetched it out\n:& cleaned it for her foot...}}\n(\"hitops\" are high boots)\n\nFrom [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[The Woodlanders]]'' of 1887, though set earlier in the century:\n\n{{quote|he saw before him the trim figure of a young woman in pattens, journeying with that steadfast concentration which means purpose and not pleasure. He was soon near enough to see that she was Marty South. Click, click, click went the pattens; and she did not turn her head.\n\nShe had, however, become aware before this that the driver of the approaching gig was Giles. She had shrunk from being overtaken by him thus; but as it was inevitable, she had braced herself up for his inspection by closing her lips so as to make her mouth quite unemotional, and by throwing an additional firmness into her tread.\n\n\"Why do you wear pattens, Marty? The turnpike is clean enough, although the lanes are muddy.\"\n\n\"They save my boots.\"\n\n\"But twelve miles in pattens\u2014'twill twist your feet off. Come, get up and ride with me.\"\n\nShe hesitated, removed her pattens, knocked the gravel out of them against the wheel, and mounted in front of the nodding specimen apple-tree.}}\n\n==Other uses of the term==\nThe word could also be used as a term for a wooden soled shoe, that is a [[chopine]] or [[clog (shoe)|clog]], as opposed to an overshoe, until at least the nineteenth century.  The word was also used for the traditional wooden outdoor shoes of [[Japan]] and other Asian countries.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =Pair of Pattens\n  | publisher =Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery\n  | url =http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973A1120\n  }}</ref> What are in effect [[snowshoe]]s for mud, as used by [[wildfowler]]s, boatmen, and [[Coast Guard]]s may also be called pattens, or \"mud-pattens\".  These are shaped boards attached to the sole of a shoe, which extend sideways well beyond the shape of the foot, and therefore are a different sort of footwear from the patten discussed here. \"Horse-pattens\" were used on horses, especially for [[plough]]ing muddy fields.  The word was also used for [[ice skating|ice-skate]]s, as it is in French (''patiner'', to skate).\n\n==The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers==\nIn [[London]], the [[Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers]] remains the [[Livery Company]], formerly [[guild]] of the Patten-makers, or Patteners, and their adopted church remains [[St Margaret Pattens]].  The first record of the guild dates to 1379, and there was still a pattenmaker listed in a London Trade Directory in the 1920s.  A notice, probably 18th century, in the Guild Church still requests ladies to remove their pattens on entering; other English churches have similar signs, and in one case, a board with pegs for ladies to hang them on.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Walraversijde49.jpg|Excavated Dutch pattens, c. 1465.

Generally worn outdoors, the coat was either sleeveless or had short sleeves or shoulder pieces. In its more developed form it was open at the sides, and it could be worn with or without a belt. Though most were ordinary garments, often workclothes, tabards might be emblazoned on the front and back with a [[heraldry|coat of arms]] ([[livery]]), and in this form they survive as the distinctive garment of [[Officer of Arms|officers of arms]].\n\nIn modern [[British English|British]] usage, the term has been revived for what is known in American English as a [[Apron#Tabard|cobbler apron]]: a lightweight open-sided upper overgarment, of similar design to its medieval and heraldic counterpart, worn in particular by workers in the catering, cleaning and healthcare industries as [[Personal protective equipment|protective clothing]], or outdoors by those requiring [[high-visibility clothing]]. Tabards may also be worn by [[percussionist]]s in [[marching band]]s in order to protect their uniforms from the straps and rigging used to support the instruments.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n[[File:the waterseller walters.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Waterseller of Seville (Vel\u00e1zquez)|The Waterseller of Seville]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], c.1620, depicting a functional workman's tabard]]\nA tabard (from the French ''tabarde'') was originally a humble outer garment of tunic form, generally without sleeves, worn by peasants, monks and foot-soldiers.

The tabard differs from others of more traditional design in that the [[Royal Arms of Canada|Canadian royal arms]] appear on the sleeves, while the front and back of the tabard are covered with Native Canadian-inspired emblematic representations of the raven-polar bears of the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]]'s [[coat of arms]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHerald Gelre of the Duke of Gueldres.jpg|Gelre Herald to the [[Guelders|Duke of Guelders]], c.1380\nJoanBeaufortandJames.jpg|[[James I of Scotland|James I]], King of Scotland 1406\u20131437, and his wife [[Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots|Joan Beaufort]]\nRubbing of the Denys funerary brass, Saint Mary the Virgin, Olveston, Gloucestershire, England.jpg|Tabards displaying [[Quarter (heraldry)|quartered]] coats of arms on front and sleeves: the [[Denys brass, Olveston|Denys brass]] of 1505, [[Olveston]], Gloucestershire\nPompa funebris Albert Ardux - Heravlts de Flandria.jpg|Heraldic tabards worn at the funeral of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], in Brussels in 1622\nLelyvanda.jpg|A pursuivant wearing his tabard \"athwart\".

V., f. 3r., Londra, British Library.jpg|thumb|300px|English ploughmen, c. 1000]]\n\n'''Early medieval European dress''', from about 400 to 1100, changed very gradually. The main feature of the period was the meeting of late Roman costume with that of the [[Migration period|invading peoples]] who moved into Europe over this period. For a period of several centuries, people in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new populations such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Visigoths]]. The most easily recognisable difference between the two groups was in male costume, where the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible [[trousers]], [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or [[tights|leggings]]. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer [[tunic]]s of Roman formal costume, coming below the knee, and often to the ankles. By the end of the period, these distinctions had finally disappeared, and Roman dress forms remained mainly as special styles of clothing for the clergy \u2013 the [[vestment]]s that have changed relatively little up to the present day.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, pp. 114\u201315.</ref>\n\nMany aspects of clothing in the period remain unknown. This is partly because only the wealthy were buried with clothing; it was rather the custom that most people were buried in ''[[shroud|burial shrouds]]'', also called ''winding sheets''.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 112.</ref> Fully dressed burial may have been regarded as a pagan custom, and an impoverished family was probably glad to keep a serviceable set of clothing in use.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Clothes were expensive for all except the richest in this period.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|right|Shoulder-clasps for an Anglo-Saxon king of the 7th century, found at [[Sutton Hoo]]]]\nApart from the elite, most people in the period had low living standards, and clothes were probably home-made, usually from cloth made at a village level, and very simply cut. The elite imported [[silk]] cloth from the Byzantine, and later Muslim, worlds, and also probably [[cotton]]. They also could afford bleached [[linen]] and dyed and simply patterned [[wool]] woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Most people probably wore only wool or linen, usually undyed, and leather or fur from locally hunted animals.\n\nArchaeological finds have shown that the elite, especially men, could own superb jewellery, most commonly [[brooch]]es to fasten their cloak, but also [[buckle]]s, [[Coin purse|purse]]s, weapon fittings, necklaces and other forms. The [[Sutton Hoo]] finds and the [[Tara Brooch]] are two of the most [[Insular art|famous examples]] from the Ireland and Britain in the middle of the period. In France, over three hundred gold and jewelled bees were found in the tomb of the [[Merovingian]] king [[Childeric I]] (died 481; all but two bees have since been stolen and lost), which are thought to have been sewn onto his cloak.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/hydrionoframes/bees.html University of Chicago article and picture]; [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b7700172d Large picture from Gallica]</ref> Metalwork accessories were the clearest indicator of high-ranking persons. In Anglo-Saxon England, and probably most of Europe, only free people could carry a [[seax]] or knife, and both sexes normally wore one at the waist, to use for all purposes.\n\n===Decoration===\nBoth men's and women's clothing was trimmed with bands of decoration, variously [[embroidery]], [[tablet weaving|tablet-woven]] bands, or colourful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.<ref>[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 309\u201315.</ref><ref name=\"Norse\">\u00d8sterg\u00e5rd, Else, ''Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland''</ref> The famous Anglo-Saxon [[opus anglicanum]] needlework was sought-after as far away as Rome.\nAnglo-Saxons wore decorated [[Belt (clothing)|belts]].\n\n==Male dress==\n[[File:Lothar I.jpg|right|thumb|King [[Lothair I]] is shown in a cloak fastened on one shoulder worn over a long-sleeved tunic and cross-gartered hose, c. 850]]\nThe primary garment was the tunic \u2014 generally a long fabric panel, folded over with a neck-hole cut into the fold, and sleeves attached. It was typical for the wealthy to display their affluence with a longer tunic made of finer and more colorful cloth, even silk or silk-trimmed. The tunic was usually belted, with either a leather or strong fabric belt. Depending on climate, trousers were tailored either loose or tight (or not worn at all if the weather was warm). The most basic leggings were strips of cloth wound round the leg, and held in place by long laces, presumably of leather, which is called cross-gartering. This may have been done with loose-fitting trousers also. Tighter-fitting hose were also worn.\n\nOver this a sleeved tunic was worn, which for the upper classes gradually became longer towards the end of the period. For peasants and warriors it was always at the knee or above. For winter, outside or formal dress, a cloak or mantle completed the outfit. The Franks had a characteristic short cape called a \"saie\", which barely came to the waist. This was fastened on the left shoulder (so as not to impede sword strokes) by a [[brooch]], typically a [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and later a round brooch on the Continent, and nearly always a round one for Anglo-Saxons, while in Ireland and Scotland the particular style of the penannular or [[Celtic brooch]] was most common. In all areas the brooch could be a highly elaborate piece of jewellery in precious metal at the top of society, with the most elaborate Celtic brooches, like the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Hunterston Brooch]], perhaps the most ornate and finely made of all. The \"cappa\" or [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a one-piece hood and cape over the shoulders was worn for cold weather, and the Roman straw hat for summer fieldwork presumably spread to the invading peoples, as it was universal by the High Middle Ages. Shoes, not always worn by the poor, were mostly the simple [[turnshoe]] \u2013 typically a cowhide sole and softer leather upper, which were sewn together, and then turned inside out.\n\n===Charlemagne===\nThe biographers of [[Charlemagne]] record that he always dressed in the Frankish style, which means that he wore similar if superior versions of the clothes of better-off peasants over much of Europe for the later centuries of the period:\n\n{{cquote|He used to wear the national, that is to say, the Frank dress: next to his skin a linen shirt and linen breeches, and above these a tunic fringed with silk; while hose fastened by bands covered his lower limbs, and shoes his feet, and he protected his shoulders and chest in winter by a close-fitting coat of [[otter]] or [[marten]] skins..... He despised foreign costumes, however handsome, and never allowed himself to be robed in them, except twice in Rome, when he donned the Roman tunic, chlamys, and shoes; the first time at the request of Pope Hadrian, the second to gratify Leo, Hadrian's successor. \u2014 [[Einhard]]}}\n\nNo English monarch of the time had his dress habits recorded in such detail. The biographers also record that he preferred English wool for his riding-cloaks (''sag\u00e6''), and complained to [[Offa of Mercia]] about a trend to make cloaks imported into Frankia impractically short. A slightly later narrative told of his dissatisfaction with the short cloaks imported from [[Frisia]]: \"What is the use of these ''pittaciola'': I cannot cover myself up with them in bed, when riding I cannot defend myself against wind and rain, and getting down for Nature's call, the deficiency freezes the thighs\".<ref>''... ad necessaria natur\u00e6 tibiarum congelatione deficio'': quoted in [[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:88\u201389..</ref> It should be noted, however, that he was six foot four inches tall.\n\n===Clergy===\nAt the beginning of this period the clergy generally dressed the same as laymen in post-Roman populations; this changed completely during the period, as lay dress changed considerably but clerical dress hardly at all, and by the end all ranks of clergy wore distinctive forms of dress.\n\nClergy wore special short hairstyles called the [[tonsure]]; in England the choice between the Roman tonsure (the top of the head shaved) and the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] tonsure (only the front of the head shaved, from ear to ear) had to be resolved at the [[Synod of Whitby]], in favour of Rome. Wealthy churches or monasteries came during this period to use richly decorated vestments for services, including [[opus anglicanum]] embroidery and imported patterned silks. Various forms of Roman-derived vestment, including the [[chasuble]], [[cope]], [[pallium]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] and [[dalmatic]] became regularised during the period, and by the end there were complicated prescriptions for who was to wear what, and when. To a large extent these forms of vestment survive today in the Catholic and (even more conservative) Anglican churches. The same process took place in the Byzantine world over the same period, which again retains early medieval styles in [[Eastern Orthodox]] vestments.\n\nSecular (i.e. non-monastic) clergy usually wore a white [[alb]], or loose tunic, tied at the waist with a cord (formally called a [[cincture]]), when not conducting services.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 114.</ref> Senior clergy seem always to have fastened their cloaks with a brooch in the centre of their chest, rather than at their right shoulder like laymen, who needed their sword-arm unencumbered.\n\n== Female dress ==\n[[File:Saxon Princess Kirkleatham.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Reconstruction from Kirkleatham Museum of the body of the Street House \"Saxon Princess\" in her bed. 7th Century AD, Northumbria, England]]\nWomen's clothing in Western Europe went through a transition during the early medieval period as the migrating Germanic tribes adopted [[Late antiquity|Late Roman]] symbols of authority, including dress. In Northern Europe, at the beginning of the period around 400 - 500 AD in Continental Europe and slightly later in England, women's clothing consisted at least one long-sleeved tunic fitted at the wrists and a tube-like garment, sometimes called a peplos, worn pinned at the shoulders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dress in Anglo-Saxon England|last=R.|first=Owen-Crocker, Gale|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=184383572X|edition=Rev. and enl.|location=Woodbridge [England]|pages=42\u201343|oclc=56050995}}</ref> This garment was carried with the Germanic Migrations to Iberia and Southern Europe. These garments could be decorated with metal applique, embroidery, and woven bands.\n\nAfter around 500 AD, women's clothing moved towards layered tunics. In the territories of the [[Franks]] and their eventual client tribes the [[Alemanni]] and [[Bavarii]], as well as in East [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], women wore a long tunic as an inner layer and a long coat, closed in the front with multiple brooches and a belt, as an outer layer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cloth and clothing in early Anglo-Saxon England, AD 450-700|last=Penelope.|first=Walton Rogers|date=2007|publisher=Council for British Archaeology|others=Council for British Archaeology.|isbn=978-1902771540|location=York|oclc=67873792}}</ref> An example of this can be seen in the interpretations of the grave of Queen [[Aregund|Arnegunde]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alfalfapress.com/suvia/?p=490|title=INFOGRAPHIC \u2013 The Arnegunde Project \u2013 Suvia's Letters|website=alfalfapress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref> Not all graves identified as female contain the brooches necessary to close the front of the \"coat dress\", indicating that not all women wore that style, or at least that not all women were buried in that style. The brooches may have been too expensive for most women.\n\nThe women of later [[Anglo-Saxon England]], outside of East Kent, mostly wore an ensemble of multiple layered tunics. These women were particularly well known for their embroidery and may have decorated their clothing with silk and wool embroidery or woven bands. These tunics are often interpreted as having a style of neckline called a \"keyhole neckline\" that may have facilitated breast-feeding. This neckline would have been closed with a brooch for modesty and warmth. In later Anglo-Saxon England, there is visual evidence for a large poncho-like garment that may have been worn by noble or royal women.\n[[File:Vikings costumes woman man Arkeologisk museum Stavanger, Norway 2015-05-27.jpg|thumb|An interpretation of the Scandinavian Apron Dress from Stavanger, Norway]]\n\nThe most famous garment of early medieval Scandinavia is the so-called Apron Dress (also called a tr\u00e4gerrock, h\u00e4ngerock, or smokkr). This may have evolved from the peplos of the early Germanic Iron Age. The garment is often interpreted as a tube shape (either fitted or loose) that is worn with straps over the shoulder and large brooches (sometimes called \"turtle brooches\") at the upper chest.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://urd.priv.no/viking/smokkr.html|title=Viking women: Clothing: Aprondress (smokkr)|website=urd.priv.no|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref> Examples of appliqued silk bands used as decoration have been found in a number of graves.<ref name=\":0\" /> Not all graves identified as belonging to women contain the brooches that typify this type of garment, indicating that some women wore a different style of clothing.

He despised foreign costumes, however handsome, and never allowed himself to be robed in them, except twice in Rome, when he donned the Roman tunic, chlamys, and shoes; the first time at the request of Pope Hadrian, the second to gratify Leo, Hadrian's successor. \u2014 [[Einhard]]}}\n\nNo English monarch of the time had his dress habits recorded in such detail. The biographers also record that he preferred English wool for his riding-cloaks (''sag\u00e6''), and complained to [[Offa of Mercia]] about a trend to make cloaks imported into Frankia impractically short. A slightly later narrative told of his dissatisfaction with the short cloaks imported from [[Frisia]]: \"What is the use of these ''pittaciola'': I cannot cover myself up with them in bed, when riding I cannot defend myself against wind and rain, and getting down for Nature's call, the deficiency freezes the thighs\".<ref>''... ad necessaria natur\u00e6 tibiarum congelatione deficio'': quoted in [[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:88\u201389..</ref> It should be noted, however, that he was six foot four inches tall.\n\n===Clergy===\nAt the beginning of this period the clergy generally dressed the same as laymen in post-Roman populations; this changed completely during the period, as lay dress changed considerably but clerical dress hardly at all, and by the end all ranks of clergy wore distinctive forms of dress.\n\nClergy wore special short hairstyles called the [[tonsure]]; in England the choice between the Roman tonsure (the top of the head shaved) and the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] tonsure (only the front of the head shaved, from ear to ear) had to be resolved at the [[Synod of Whitby]], in favour of Rome. Wealthy churches or monasteries came during this period to use richly decorated vestments for services, including [[opus anglicanum]] embroidery and imported patterned silks. Various forms of Roman-derived vestment, including the [[chasuble]], [[cope]], [[pallium]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] and [[dalmatic]] became regularised during the period, and by the end there were complicated prescriptions for who was to wear what, and when. To a large extent these forms of vestment survive today in the Catholic and (even more conservative) Anglican churches. The same process took place in the Byzantine world over the same period, which again retains early medieval styles in [[Eastern Orthodox]] vestments.\n\nSecular (i.e. non-monastic) clergy usually wore a white [[alb]], or loose tunic, tied at the waist with a cord (formally called a [[cincture]]), when not conducting services.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 114.</ref> Senior clergy seem always to have fastened their cloaks with a brooch in the centre of their chest, rather than at their right shoulder like laymen, who needed their sword-arm unencumbered.\n\n== Female dress ==\n[[File:Saxon Princess Kirkleatham.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Reconstruction from Kirkleatham Museum of the body of the Street House \"Saxon Princess\" in her bed. 7th Century AD, Northumbria, England]]\nWomen's clothing in Western Europe went through a transition during the early medieval period as the migrating Germanic tribes adopted [[Late antiquity|Late Roman]] symbols of authority, including dress. In Northern Europe, at the beginning of the period around 400 - 500 AD in Continental Europe and slightly later in England, women's clothing consisted at least one long-sleeved tunic fitted at the wrists and a tube-like garment, sometimes called a peplos, worn pinned at the shoulders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dress in Anglo-Saxon England|last=R.|first=Owen-Crocker, Gale|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=184383572X|edition=Rev. and enl.|location=Woodbridge [England]|pages=42\u201343|oclc=56050995}}</ref> This garment was carried with the Germanic Migrations to Iberia and Southern Europe. These garments could be decorated with metal applique, embroidery, and woven bands.\n\nAfter around 500 AD, women's clothing moved towards layered tunics. In the territories of the [[Franks]] and their eventual client tribes the [[Alemanni]] and [[Bavarii]], as well as in East [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], women wore a long tunic as an inner layer and a long coat, closed in the front with multiple brooches and a belt, as an outer layer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cloth and clothing in early Anglo-Saxon England, AD 450-700|last=Penelope.|first=Walton Rogers|date=2007|publisher=Council for British Archaeology|others=Council for British Archaeology.|isbn=978-1902771540|location=York|oclc=67873792}}</ref> An example of this can be seen in the interpretations of the grave of Queen [[Aregund|Arnegunde]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alfalfapress.com/suvia/?p=490|title=INFOGRAPHIC \u2013 The Arnegunde Project \u2013 Suvia's Letters|website=alfalfapress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref> Not all graves identified as female contain the brooches necessary to close the front of the \"coat dress\", indicating that not all women wore that style, or at least that not all women were buried in that style. The brooches may have been too expensive for most women.\n\nThe women of later [[Anglo-Saxon England]], outside of East Kent, mostly wore an ensemble of multiple layered tunics. These women were particularly well known for their embroidery and may have decorated their clothing with silk and wool embroidery or woven bands. These tunics are often interpreted as having a style of neckline called a \"keyhole neckline\" that may have facilitated breast-feeding. This neckline would have been closed with a brooch for modesty and warmth. In later Anglo-Saxon England, there is visual evidence for a large poncho-like garment that may have been worn by noble or royal women.\n[[File:Vikings costumes woman man Arkeologisk museum Stavanger, Norway 2015-05-27.jpg|thumb|An interpretation of the Scandinavian Apron Dress from Stavanger, Norway]]\n\nThe most famous garment of early medieval Scandinavia is the so-called Apron Dress (also called a tr\u00e4gerrock, h\u00e4ngerock, or smokkr). This may have evolved from the peplos of the early Germanic Iron Age. The garment is often interpreted as a tube shape (either fitted or loose) that is worn with straps over the shoulder and large brooches (sometimes called \"turtle brooches\") at the upper chest.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://urd.priv.no/viking/smokkr.html|title=Viking women: Clothing: Aprondress (smokkr)|website=urd.priv.no|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref> Examples of appliqued silk bands used as decoration have been found in a number of graves.<ref name=\":0\" /> Not all graves identified as belonging to women contain the brooches that typify this type of garment, indicating that some women wore a different style of clothing.

[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] was largely ruled by the [[Moors]] in the later part of the period, and in any case had received rather different influences from the [[Visigoth]]s compared to other invading peoples; Spanish dress remained distinctive well after the end of the period.

Kup, \"A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book\", ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''. 43/6 (June 1939), 481.</ref> They consisted of a book whose leather binding continued loose below the cover of the book in a long tapered tail with a large knot at the end which could be tucked into one's [[girdle]] or belt. The knot was usually strips of leather woven together for durability. The book hung upside down and backwards so that when swung upwards it was ready for reading. The books were normally religious: a cleric's daily Office, or for lay persons (especially women) a [[Book of Hours]].  \n\nOne of the best known texts to become a girdle book is Boethius's ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', although it is the only surviving philosophical/theological girdle book. Women especially wore the girdle book out of convenience since it was already fashionable, at least in the 15th century, to wear a girdle belt above the waistline.<ref>Egan, Geoff and Pritchard, Frances. et al. \"Girdles\" ''Dress Accessories'': c.1150-c.1450 Museum of London, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1991.</ref> A book secured on the [[girdle|girdle belt]] served both the utilitarian function of enabling hands-free carrying and protecting valuable books from theft and the elements. It also made a visible statement of social position, wealth and learning (or at least literacy).<ref>Margit Smith and Jim Bloxam. \"The Medieval Girdle Book Project\" V3.N4. ''International Journal of the Book'' Melbourne, Australia, 2005. Pg 7.</ref> Authoritative figures, saints or apostles like St. Jerome were often depicted holding girdle books.<ref>Raymond Clemens & Timothy Graham. ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies''. Cornell U Press. 2007. Pg 56-57.</ref> Girdle books also appeared to be a fashionable accessory for lay women. Artistic depictions of the girdle book confirm their popularity as an accessory.<ref>\"Girdles\" Pg. 35-49.</ref> \n\nGirdle books first appeared in the late 13th century and gained popularity through the 15th sometimes becoming ostentatious jewel-encrusted presentation books and falling out of favour late in the 16th century, when printed books had become much more common.<ref>[http://aelflaed.homemail.com.au/doco/girdlebook.html \"Girdle Book Slip-Cover\"], Crispin Sexi (Jaysen Ollerenshaw), 2005. Accessed December 2006.</ref> Another possible reason for their decline was the relatively small number of specialized girdle-protected texts becoming outdated with little need to replace them. In an environment of increasingly cheap printing it was simpler to replicate texts than spend time preserving individual [[manuscript]]s. The intricately constructed girdle bindings were simply impractical after a certain point.\n\n==In art==\nThere are hundreds of artistic representations of girdle books.  The [[Virgin Mary]] is shown reading one in such famous paintings as the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and [[M\u00e9rode Altarpiece]], and [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] reads one in the painting with [[Mary Magdalene]] by [[Konrad Witz]]. The donor reads one in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna with Canon van der Paele]]''.\nTheir popularity in art indicates a much wider distribution and adoption of the girdle book as a binding than surviving copies suggest. But in art, books not being read tend to be carried by the folds of the cover rather than secured to the belt, and many are too large to be carried around as an accessory.  \n\nA list of 150 examples \"shows the proportion of representation in painting and in sculpture [as] almost equal.\" However, only 23 medieval girdle books have survived in their original binding, the oldest datable example being from Kastl, Germany (ca. 1453).<ref>Bruckner, Ursula, Bruckner, \"Beutelbuch-Originale\", ''Studien zum Buch- und Biblionthekswesen 9 (1995): 5-23. See also: [http://www.nypl.org/press/2002/liturgical.cfm \" Rare and Beautiful Liturgical Manuscripts on Display at The New York Public Library\"]. Accessed December 2006.</ref> At least part of the reason for the small number of surviving examples stems from the fact that the use of the girdle book was largely confined to a narrow area from the Netherlands to the Upper Rhine Valley.<ref>\"A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book\" Pg 481</ref>  \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Robert Campin 015.jpg|[[Saint Barbara]], wing of the ''[[Werl Triptych]]'', [[Robert Campin]]\nFile:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Virgin Mary (detail) - WGA07629.jpg|[[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', Virgin Mary\nFile:Katharinaundmagdalena.jpg|''Saints Catherine and Mary Magdalene'', [[Konrad Witz]], c. 1440\nFile:Martin Schongauer - The Holy Family - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Martin Schongauer]], ''The Holy Family''\nFile:Canon van der Paele (Book and Glasses) Van Eyck.jpg|[[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna with Canon van der Paele]]''\nFile:Malling Kirke Altertavle del.jpg|Apostles on a Danish [[altarpiece]]\nFile:Helgen med posebind.jpg|Another Danish apostle\nFile:Verg\u00e4nglichkeitsbuch 210 100v Totentanz.jpg|''[[Totentanz]]'', Death comes for a monk, with a book in his belt.\n</gallery>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:BLB Cod K 3356 2v-3r.jpg|thumb|German lady's girdle book of 1540]]\n\nGirdle books were a variant on other forms of medieval [[book-binding]] in which the leather or cloth continued loose beyond the edges of the hard cover. Especially for small personal books like the Book of Hours, the leather often extended sideways, which gave extra protection for the book when not in use - the loose edges could be wrapped round, and often buckles or laces enabled the book to be securely closed. In addition, when reading, the book could be held from outside the cover, so that the clean inside surface of the leather, rather than the thumbs of the reader, touched the pages. This stopped the pages acquiring the dirty patches in the lower margins that many medieval books have. These too are often shown in art, although it is noticeable that readers are often not making full use of the protective way of holding the book.\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg \u2014 GNM 2013-09-07 Mattes (11) (cropped).JPG|thumb|270px|A girdle book from Nuremberg from 1471]]\n\nThe knot used for the handle was a [[Turk's head knot]], so named for similar appearance to the turbans worn by medieval Muslims of the Turkish Empire. Sometimes the girdle book had a hook that fastened to the belt; \"a hinge connected the hook to the flap of the binding, allowing maximal movement of the book while it was still attached.\"\n\nMany girdle books were unadorned; however, there are also many that have brass corner pieces, carvings, awl punctures, artisan clasps, and possibly a family crest or other mark on the front. Given the security afforded by carrying the book around, it was less risky to add decoration and gilding to a book less easily stolen than a shelved manuscript. Additionally, ornate metal clasps and hinges were more durable than woven leather or cloth bindings that wore out more quickly from heavy use.\n\n== Variations ==\nAlthough not strictly girdle books, several other types of portable books were in use during the same time period.<ref>''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.</ref>  Some larger books had rings attached to the standard binding so a cord could be slipped through them and wrapped around the waist. Other books were small enough that they could be worn around the neck. A small chain looped through a ring or two at the top of the binding was all that was necessary to make it portable. Finally, a fourth type of portable book was the ''[[vade mecum]]'' (go with me), consisting of a booklet or folded sheets that contained an [[almanac]] or medical information and could be suspended from a belt. The text on a vade mecum would be arranged in such a way as to be legible as someone unfolded the parchment, rather than having to constantly reorient the sheets.<ref>''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.</ref>\n\nAccording to The Medieval Girdle Book Project: \n<blockquote>\nContainers and protective enclosures for books have been in use since long before the Middle Ages; the clay pots housing the Dead Sea Scrolls come to mind as do the leather cylinders used to store scrolls and clay tablets in the library at Alexandria and others, and the [[Cumdach|cumbdachs]] used by Irish monks to carry their precious manuscripts and prayer books from place to place, possibly even to Iceland, which they reached as early as 700 AD.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Lack of literature ==\nDespite their significant representation in art depicting medieval clergy, there is a scarcity of literature outside of small communities seeking to recreate them.

Kup, \"A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book\", ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''. 43/6 (June 1939), 481.</ref> They consisted of a book whose leather binding continued loose below the cover of the book in a long tapered tail with a large knot at the end which could be tucked into one's [[girdle]] or belt. The knot was usually strips of leather woven together for durability. The book hung upside down and backwards so that when swung upwards it was ready for reading. The books were normally religious: a cleric's daily Office, or for lay persons (especially women) a [[Book of Hours]].  \n\nOne of the best known texts to become a girdle book is Boethius's ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', although it is the only surviving philosophical/theological girdle book. Women especially wore the girdle book out of convenience since it was already fashionable, at least in the 15th century, to wear a girdle belt above the waistline.<ref>Egan, Geoff and Pritchard, Frances. et al. \"Girdles\" ''Dress Accessories'': c.1150-c.1450 Museum of London, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1991.</ref> A book secured on the [[girdle|girdle belt]] served both the utilitarian function of enabling hands-free carrying and protecting valuable books from theft and the elements. It also made a visible statement of social position, wealth and learning (or at least literacy).<ref>Margit Smith and Jim Bloxam. \"The Medieval Girdle Book Project\" V3.N4. ''International Journal of the Book'' Melbourne, Australia, 2005. Pg 7.</ref> Authoritative figures, saints or apostles like St. Jerome were often depicted holding girdle books.<ref>Raymond Clemens & Timothy Graham. ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies''. Cornell U Press. 2007. Pg 56-57.</ref> Girdle books also appeared to be a fashionable accessory for lay women. Artistic depictions of the girdle book confirm their popularity as an accessory.<ref>\"Girdles\" Pg. 35-49.</ref> \n\nGirdle books first appeared in the late 13th century and gained popularity through the 15th sometimes becoming ostentatious jewel-encrusted presentation books and falling out of favour late in the 16th century, when printed books had become much more common.<ref>[http://aelflaed.homemail.com.au/doco/girdlebook.html \"Girdle Book Slip-Cover\"], Crispin Sexi (Jaysen Ollerenshaw), 2005. Accessed December 2006.</ref> Another possible reason for their decline was the relatively small number of specialized girdle-protected texts becoming outdated with little need to replace them. In an environment of increasingly cheap printing it was simpler to replicate texts than spend time preserving individual [[manuscript]]s. The intricately constructed girdle bindings were simply impractical after a certain point.\n\n==In art==\nThere are hundreds of artistic representations of girdle books.  The [[Virgin Mary]] is shown reading one in such famous paintings as the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and [[M\u00e9rode Altarpiece]], and [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] reads one in the painting with [[Mary Magdalene]] by [[Konrad Witz]]. The donor reads one in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna with Canon van der Paele]]''.\nTheir popularity in art indicates a much wider distribution and adoption of the girdle book as a binding than surviving copies suggest. But in art, books not being read tend to be carried by the folds of the cover rather than secured to the belt, and many are too large to be carried around as an accessory.  \n\nA list of 150 examples \"shows the proportion of representation in painting and in sculpture [as] almost equal.\" However, only 23 medieval girdle books have survived in their original binding, the oldest datable example being from Kastl, Germany (ca. 1453).<ref>Bruckner, Ursula, Bruckner, \"Beutelbuch-Originale\", ''Studien zum Buch- und Biblionthekswesen 9 (1995): 5-23. See also: [http://www.nypl.org/press/2002/liturgical.cfm \" Rare and Beautiful Liturgical Manuscripts on Display at The New York Public Library\"]. Accessed December 2006.</ref> At least part of the reason for the small number of surviving examples stems from the fact that the use of the girdle book was largely confined to a narrow area from the Netherlands to the Upper Rhine Valley.<ref>\"A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book\" Pg 481</ref>  \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Robert Campin 015.jpg|[[Saint Barbara]], wing of the ''[[Werl Triptych]]'', [[Robert Campin]]\nFile:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Virgin Mary (detail) - WGA07629.jpg|[[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', Virgin Mary\nFile:Katharinaundmagdalena.jpg|''Saints Catherine and Mary Magdalene'', [[Konrad Witz]], c. 1440\nFile:Martin Schongauer - The Holy Family - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Martin Schongauer]], ''The Holy Family''\nFile:Canon van der Paele (Book and Glasses) Van Eyck.jpg|[[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna with Canon van der Paele]]''\nFile:Malling Kirke Altertavle del.jpg|Apostles on a Danish [[altarpiece]]\nFile:Helgen med posebind.jpg|Another Danish apostle\nFile:Verg\u00e4nglichkeitsbuch 210 100v Totentanz.jpg|''[[Totentanz]]'', Death comes for a monk, with a book in his belt.\n</gallery>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:BLB Cod K 3356 2v-3r.jpg|thumb|German lady's girdle book of 1540]]\n\nGirdle books were a variant on other forms of medieval [[book-binding]] in which the leather or cloth continued loose beyond the edges of the hard cover. Especially for small personal books like the Book of Hours, the leather often extended sideways, which gave extra protection for the book when not in use - the loose edges could be wrapped round, and often buckles or laces enabled the book to be securely closed. In addition, when reading, the book could be held from outside the cover, so that the clean inside surface of the leather, rather than the thumbs of the reader, touched the pages. This stopped the pages acquiring the dirty patches in the lower margins that many medieval books have. These too are often shown in art, although it is noticeable that readers are often not making full use of the protective way of holding the book.\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg \u2014 GNM 2013-09-07 Mattes (11) (cropped).JPG|thumb|270px|A girdle book from Nuremberg from 1471]]\n\nThe knot used for the handle was a [[Turk's head knot]], so named for similar appearance to the turbans worn by medieval Muslims of the Turkish Empire. Sometimes the girdle book had a hook that fastened to the belt; \"a hinge connected the hook to the flap of the binding, allowing maximal movement of the book while it was still attached.\"\n\nMany girdle books were unadorned; however, there are also many that have brass corner pieces, carvings, awl punctures, artisan clasps, and possibly a family crest or other mark on the front. Given the security afforded by carrying the book around, it was less risky to add decoration and gilding to a book less easily stolen than a shelved manuscript. Additionally, ornate metal clasps and hinges were more durable than woven leather or cloth bindings that wore out more quickly from heavy use.\n\n== Variations ==\nAlthough not strictly girdle books, several other types of portable books were in use during the same time period.<ref>''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.</ref>  Some larger books had rings attached to the standard binding so a cord could be slipped through them and wrapped around the waist. Other books were small enough that they could be worn around the neck. A small chain looped through a ring or two at the top of the binding was all that was necessary to make it portable. Finally, a fourth type of portable book was the ''[[vade mecum]]'' (go with me), consisting of a booklet or folded sheets that contained an [[almanac]] or medical information and could be suspended from a belt. The text on a vade mecum would be arranged in such a way as to be legible as someone unfolded the parchment, rather than having to constantly reorient the sheets.<ref>''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.</ref>\n\nAccording to The Medieval Girdle Book Project: \n<blockquote>\nContainers and protective enclosures for books have been in use since long before the Middle Ages; the clay pots housing the Dead Sea Scrolls come to mind as do the leather cylinders used to store scrolls and clay tablets in the library at Alexandria and others, and the [[Cumdach|cumbdachs]] used by Irish monks to carry their precious manuscripts and prayer books from place to place, possibly even to Iceland, which they reached as early as 700 AD.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Lack of literature ==\nDespite their significant representation in art depicting medieval clergy, there is a scarcity of literature outside of small communities seeking to recreate them.
