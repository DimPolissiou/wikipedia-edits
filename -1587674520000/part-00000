second [[List of leaders of North Korea|leader]] of [[North Korea]]. He ruled from the death of his father, [[Kim Il-sung]], the first leader of North Korea in 1994 until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his own death]] in 2011.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kim had become the [[heir apparent]] for the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and DPRK founder [[Kim Il-sung]], following the [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|elder Kim's death]] in 1994. Kim was the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Presidium]], [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman]] of the [[National Defence Commission]] (NDC) of North Korea and the [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), the [[List of countries by number of troops|fourth-largest standing army]] in the world.\n\nKim assumed supreme leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a [[North Korean famine|famine]]. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure due in part to the country's mountainous geography unsuited for high-yielding agriculture as well as externally-imposed sanctions due to concerns about the country's [[Human rights in North Korea|human rights]] situation. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his ''[[Songun]]'' (\"military-first\") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the [[Kaesong Industrial Park]] in 2003. In April 2009, [[North Korea's constitution]] was amended to refer to him and his successors as the \"supreme leader of the DPRK\". Outside observers have characterized him as a [[dictator]] and accused him of [[human rights violations]].\n\nThe most common colloquial [[List of Kim Jong-il's titles|title given to Kim]] was \"Dear Leader\" to distinguish him from his father [[Kim Il-sung]], the \"Great Leader\". Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|had died]] two days earlier, whereupon his third son, [[Kim Jong-un]], was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, Kim was designated the \"Eternal General Secretary\" of the WPK and the \"Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission\", in keeping with [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|the tradition of establishing eternal posts]] for the dead members of the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nSoviet records show that Kim was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim ({{lang-ru|\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0418\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0438\u043c}})<ref name=\"birthname\">{{Cite news|url=http://nk.chosun.com/english/news/news.html?ACT=detail&res_id=7283|date=22 August 2002|accessdate=19 February 2007|periodical=The Chosun Ilbo|title=Sergeyevna Remembers Kim Jong Il|last=Chung|first=Byoung-sun|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311153844/http://nk.chosun.com/english/news/news.html?ACT=detail&res_id=7283|archivedate=11 March 2007}}<br />{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1671983|publisher=NPR|date=12 February 2004|accessdate=19 February 2007|title=A Visit to Kim Jong Il's Russian Birthplace|last=Sheets|first=Lawrence}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/05/i_ins.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com/gallery/26532/image/51407067/north-korea-secrets-and-lies#index/7|title=Kim Jong-Il, Kim Il-Sung \u2013 In the Family Business \u2013 North Korea: Secrets and Lies \u2013 Photo Gallery|work=Life|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> in 1941 in the village of [[Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai|Vyatskoye]], near [[Khabarovsk]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1907197.stm|title=Profile: Kim Jong-il|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> where his father, [[Kim Il-sung]], commanded the 1st [[Battalion]] of the Soviet 88th Brigade,{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=4}} made up of Chinese and Korean [[exile]]s.

The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool.

He was active in the Korean Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957 he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher).

Since 1988, Kim Pyong-il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to [[Poland]].

He was given senior posts in the [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Military Commission]] and the party [[Secretariat of the Workers' Party of Korea|Secretariat]]. According to his official biography, the WPK Central Committee had already anointed him successor to Kim Il-sung in February 1974. When he was made a member of the [[1982 North Korean parliamentary election|Seventh Supreme People's Assembly]] in February 1982, international observers deemed him the [[heir apparent]] of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he had no public profile and was referred to only as the \"Party Centre\".{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=127}}\n\nAt this time Kim assumed the title \"Dear Leader\" ({{korean|hangul=\uce5c\uc560\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc790|mr=ch'inaehan\u016dn jidoja|context=north}}),<ref name=\"dear\">''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/North-Korea/North-Koreas-dear-leader-less-dear/2004/11/18/1100748136912.html \"North Korea's dear leader less dear\"]'', Fairfax Digital, 19 November 2004.</ref> the government began building a [[personality cult]] around him patterned after that of his father, the \"Great Leader\". Kim was regularly hailed by the media as the \"fearless leader\" and \"the great successor to the revolutionary cause\". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea.\n\nOn 24 December 1991, Kim was also named [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16325390|title=Kim Jong-un 'supreme commander'|date=24 December 2011|access-date=6 January 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref> Defence Minister [[Oh Jin-wu]], one of Kim Il-sung's most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim's acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military service. The only other possible leadership candidate, Prime Minister [[Kim Il (politician)|Kim Il]] (no relation), was removed from his posts in 1976. In 1992, Kim Il-sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People's Republic.\n\nIn 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the \"Dear Father\", instead of the \"Dear Leader\", suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations, exceeded only by those for the 80th [[birthday of Kim Il-sung]] himself on 15 April that same year.\n\nAccording to defector [[Hwang Jang-yop]], the North Korean government system became even more centralized and [[autocratic]] during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il-sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong-il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong-il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/rok/nis-docs/hwang2.htm|title=Testimony of Hwang Jang-yop}}</ref>\n[[File:Kim Jong-il in North Korean propaganda (6075328850).jpg|thumb|Idealized portrait of Kim Jong-il]]\n\nBy the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation. Kim Il-sung's policy of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even with its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China. South Korea accused Kim of ordering the [[Rangoon bombing|1983 bombing in Rangoon]], Burma which killed 17 visiting South Korean officials, including four cabinet members, and another in 1987 which killed all 115 on board [[Korean Air Flight 858]].<ref name=\"yangon\">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/asia/northkorea/keyplayers/kimjongil.html \"North Korea: Nuclear Standoff\"], ''The Online NewsHour'', [[PBS]], 19 October 2006.</ref> A North Korean agent, [[Kim Hyon Hui]], confessed to planting a bomb in the case of the second, saying the operation was ordered by Kim personally.<ref name=\"hyonhui\">[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FL16Dh02.html Fake ashes, very real North Korean sanctions], ''Asia Times Online'', 16 December 2004.</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Kim made his first public speech during a military parade for the KPA's 60th anniversary and said:<ref name=\"Lim2008\">{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Kim Jong-il's Leadership of North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ag16AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=24 November 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-01712-6|page=155}}</ref> \"Glory to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army!\".<ref name=\"Jeffries2012\">{{cite book|author=Ian Jeffries|title=North Korea, 2009-2012: A Guide to Economic and Political Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVv-IYB2E-QC&pg=PA674|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-11698-9|page=674}}</ref> These words were followed by a loud applause by the crowd at Pyongyang's [[Kim Il-sung Square]] where the parade was held.\n\nKim was named [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman]] of the [[National Defence Commission of North Korea|National Defence Commission]] on 9 April 1993,<ref name=\"nkle_20th\">{{Cite web|title=20th Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Election as NDC Chairman Commemorated|website=nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com|date=8 April 2014|accessdate=15 December 2014|url=http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/20th-anniversary-of-kim-jong-ils-election-as-ndc-chairman-commemorated/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220151007/https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/20th-anniversary-of-kim-jong-ils-election-as-ndc-chairman-commemorated/|archivedate=20 February 2015}}</ref> making him day-to-day commander of the armed forces.\n\n== Leader of North Korea ==\n[[File:The statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang (april 2012).jpg|thumb|North Koreans bowing to the statues of Kim Jong-il and his father, [[Kim Il-sung]], at the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]]]]\n\nOn 8 July 1994, [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim il-sung died]] at the age of 82 from a heart attack.{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=291}} Although Kim Jong-il had been his father's designated successor as early as 1974{{sfn|Lim|2015|p=90}} and had been named commander-in-chief in 1991,{{sfn|Becker|2006|p=129}} it took him some time to consolidate his power.\n\nHe officially took over his father's old post as [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea]] on 8 October 1997.{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=175}} In 1998, he was reelected as chairman of the National Defence Commission, and a constitutional amendment declared that post to be \"the highest post of the state.\"{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=296}} Also in 1998, the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's \"[[Eternal President of the Republic|Eternal President]]\" in order to honor his memory forever.{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=274}}\n\nOfficially, Kim was part of a [[triumvirate]] heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier [[Choe Yong-rim]] and parliament chairman [[Kim Yong-nam]] (no relation).

He ruled from the death of his father, [[Kim Il-sung]], the first leader of North Korea in 1994 until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his own death]] in 2011.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kim had become the [[heir apparent]] for the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and DPRK founder [[Kim Il-sung]], following the [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|elder Kim's death]] in 1994. Kim was the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Presidium]], [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman]] of the [[National Defence Commission]] (NDC) of North Korea and the [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), the [[List of countries by number of troops|fourth-largest standing army]] in the world.\n\nKim assumed supreme leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a [[North Korean famine|famine]]. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure due in part to the country's mountainous geography unsuited for high-yielding agriculture as well as externally-imposed sanctions due to concerns about the country's [[Human rights in North Korea|human rights]] situation. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his ''[[Songun]]'' (\"military-first\") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the [[Kaesong Industrial Park]] in 2003. In April 2009, [[North Korea's constitution]] was amended to refer to him and his successors as the \"supreme leader of the DPRK\". Outside observers have characterized him as a [[dictator]] and accused him of [[human rights violations]].\n\nThe most common colloquial [[List of Kim Jong-il's titles|title given to Kim]] was \"Dear Leader\" to distinguish him from his father [[Kim Il-sung]], the \"Great Leader\". Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|had died]] two days earlier, whereupon his third son, [[Kim Jong-un]], was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, Kim was designated the \"Eternal General Secretary\" of the WPK and the \"Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission\", in keeping with [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|the tradition of establishing eternal posts]] for the dead members of the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nSoviet records show that Kim was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim ({{lang-ru|\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0418\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0438\u043c}})<ref name=\"birthname\">{{Cite news|url=http://nk.chosun.com/english/news/news.html?ACT=detail&res_id=7283|date=22 August 2002|accessdate=19 February 2007|periodical=The Chosun Ilbo|title=Sergeyevna Remembers Kim Jong Il|last=Chung|first=Byoung-sun|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311153844/http://nk.chosun.com/english/news/news.html?ACT=detail&res_id=7283|archivedate=11 March 2007}}<br />{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1671983|publisher=NPR|date=12 February 2004|accessdate=19 February 2007|title=A Visit to Kim Jong Il's Russian Birthplace|last=Sheets|first=Lawrence}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/05/i_ins.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com/gallery/26532/image/51407067/north-korea-secrets-and-lies#index/7|title=Kim Jong-Il, Kim Il-Sung \u2013 In the Family Business \u2013 North Korea: Secrets and Lies \u2013 Photo Gallery|work=Life|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> in 1941 in the village of [[Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai|Vyatskoye]], near [[Khabarovsk]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1907197.stm|title=Profile: Kim Jong-il|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> where his father, [[Kim Il-sung]], commanded the 1st [[Battalion]] of the Soviet 88th Brigade,{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=4}} made up of Chinese and Korean [[exile]]s.

His father returned to [[Pyongyang]] that September, and in late November Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at [[Sonbong]]. The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool.

He was active in the Korean Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957 he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher).

Since 1988, Kim Pyong-il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to [[Poland]].

He was given senior posts in the [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Military Commission]] and the party [[Secretariat of the Workers' Party of Korea|Secretariat]]. According to his official biography, the WPK Central Committee had already anointed him successor to Kim Il-sung in February 1974. When he was made a member of the [[1982 North Korean parliamentary election|Seventh Supreme People's Assembly]] in February 1982, international observers deemed him the [[heir apparent]] of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he had no public profile and was referred to only as the \"Party Centre\".{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=127}}\n\nAt this time Kim assumed the title \"Dear Leader\" ({{korean|hangul=\uce5c\uc560\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc790|mr=ch'inaehan\u016dn jidoja|context=north}}),<ref name=\"dear\">''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/North-Korea/North-Koreas-dear-leader-less-dear/2004/11/18/1100748136912.html \"North Korea's dear leader less dear\"]'', Fairfax Digital, 19 November 2004.</ref> the government began building a [[personality cult]] around him patterned after that of his father, the \"Great Leader\". Kim was regularly hailed by the media as the \"fearless leader\" and \"the great successor to the revolutionary cause\". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea.\n\nOn 24 December 1991, Kim was also named [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16325390|title=Kim Jong-un 'supreme commander'|date=24 December 2011|access-date=6 January 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref> Defence Minister [[Oh Jin-wu]], one of Kim Il-sung's most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim's acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military service. The only other possible leadership candidate, Prime Minister [[Kim Il (politician)|Kim Il]] (no relation), was removed from his posts in 1976. In 1992, Kim Il-sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People's Republic.\n\nIn 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the \"Dear Father\", instead of the \"Dear Leader\", suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations, exceeded only by those for the 80th [[birthday of Kim Il-sung]] himself on 15 April that same year.\n\nAccording to defector [[Hwang Jang-yop]], the North Korean government system became even more centralized and [[autocratic]] during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il-sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong-il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong-il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/rok/nis-docs/hwang2.htm|title=Testimony of Hwang Jang-yop}}</ref>\n[[File:Kim Jong-il in North Korean propaganda (6075328850).jpg|thumb|Idealized portrait of Kim Jong-il]]\n\nBy the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation.

The film stars [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Geoff Stults]], [[Isabella Rice]], and [[Cheryl Ladd]], and follows a divorc\u00e9e who begins to torment her ex-husband's new fianc\u00e9e.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 17, 2015 in [[Los Angeles]]. The film was released on April 21, 2017 by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film, which received mostly negative reviews, grossed $11.8 million in the US and $17.8 million worldwide against its $26.9 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nJulia Banks ([[Rosario Dawson]]) is questioned for the murder of her psychotic ex-boyfriend, Michael ([[Simon Kassianides]]). Julia claims she has been set up, despite social media conversations showing her lusting after Michael.\n\nSix months earlier, Julia receives a send-off from her boss and friend, Ali ([[Whitney Cummings]]), from her job as chief online editor for a storytelling website. Julia plans to work remotely from the mansion she will share with her fianc\u00e9 David Connover ([[Geoff Stults]]) and her soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily ([[Isabella Rice]]). At David's house, Julia is greeted by his ex-wife Tessa ([[Katherine Heigl]]), who is not coping with the end of their marriage two years earlier.\n\nThe next evening, Tessa drops something off at the house, and Lily insists she stays for dinner. Tessa criticizes Julia's cooking and leaves. Julia learns that her [[restraining order]] against Michael has expired, much to her distress.\n\nTessa is visited by \"Lovey\" ([[Cheryl Ladd]]), her controlling and belittling mother. Investigating Julia online, Tessa discovers her restraining order against Michael. She sets up a [[Facebook]] account impersonating Julia, and messages Michael, telling him how much \"Julia\" misses him.\n\nJulia receives a surprise flower delivery, sent anonymously by Tessa to make it appear Julia is having an affair. While Julia is at the door, Tessa sneaks in and steals David's watch, his grandmother's wedding ring, and a pair of Julia's panties. That afternoon, while Julia and Lily visit David at a farmer's market, Lily wanders off. Julia finds her in the arms of Tessa, who is complaining to David about Julia's incompetence as a mother. When Tessa shows up at the house, Julia confronts her for trying to reenter David's life. The women have lunch together in an attempt to reconcile, and Tessa claims that David left her was because he suspected she was having an affair. Tessa mails Michael the watch and panties.\n\nTessa tries to get Lily to ride an unruly horse at her [[equestrianism|horseback riding]] practice, but Julia notices Lily\u2019s fear and takes her home, to Tessa's annoyance. That night, Tessa pleasures herself in her car while sending [[sexting|sexually explicit messages]], posing as Julia, to Michael.\n\nTessa cuts Lily's long hair short as punishment for leaving riding practice early, leading to a heated argument with Julia. Tessa throws herself down the stairs and pretends Julia accidentally pushed her when David arrives. After taking Tessa to a hospital, David castigates Julia for treating his ex-wife so badly. Julia calls on Ali for help, and they discover Tessa\u2019s child services records; as a teenager, she attempted to kill her father when he cheated on her mother.\n\nTessa messages Michael, as Julia, saying she wants him to visit for sex. Michael enters the house when Julia is alone, and when she spurns his advances, he attacks her. A badly beaten Julia stabs him in the leg with a kitchen knife and escapes the house. Tessa, waiting outside, enters and stabs Michael in the chest.\n\nIn the present, the police release Julia, stating the investigation into Michael\u2019s death will continue. David is initially supportive after a tearful Julia explains her history with Michael, but when the police show him the \"evidence\", he becomes disillusioned and goes to Tessa's house to get Lily. There, he sees burned gloves in the fireplace and his grandmother's wedding ring on Tessa's finger, realizing that Tessa framed Julia.\n\nTessa knocks David out with a fireplace poker. Julia arrives and tries to call 9-1-1, but is attacked by Tessa. Subduing Tessa, Julia rushes to revive David, but Tessa attacks her with a knife. Seeing herself in a mirror, Tessa realizes the monster she has become and stabs herself in the stomach. Dying, Tessa begs Julia to not let Lily remember her like this.\n\nSix months later, David and Julia are married and have moved into a new house with Lily. Julia answers the door to find Lovey wanting to see her granddaughter. Julia looks on in horror as Lovey hugs Lily.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- all opening credit names/order, with roles per closing credits --->\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Julia Banks, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Tessa Connover, David's ex-wife\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as David Connover, Tessa's ex-husband and Lily's father\n* [[Cheryl Ladd]] as Helen/\"Lovey\", Tessa's mother\n* [[Sarah Burns]] as Sarah, David's friend since childhood\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Ali, Julia\u2019s best friend\n* [[Simon Kassianides]] as Michael Vargas, Julia's abusive and violent ex-boyfriend\n* [[Isabella Rice|Isabella Kai Rice]] as Lily Connover, Tessa and David's daughter\n* [[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]] as Detective Pope\n* [[Jayson Blair (actor)|Jayson Blair]] as Jason\n\n== Production ==\nOn January 9, 2014, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] had hired [[Amma Asante]] to direct the [[female]]-centric thriller ''Unforgettable''.

The film, which received mostly negative reviews, grossed $11.8 million in the US and $17.8 million worldwide against its $12 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nJulia Banks ([[Rosario Dawson]]) is questioned for the murder of her psychotic ex-boyfriend, Michael ([[Simon Kassianides]]). Julia claims she has been set up, despite social media conversations showing her lusting after Michael.\n\nSix months earlier, Julia receives a send-off from her boss and friend, Ali ([[Whitney Cummings]]), from her job as chief online editor for a storytelling website. Julia plans to work remotely from the mansion she will share with her fianc\u00e9 David Connover ([[Geoff Stults]]) and her soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily ([[Isabella Rice]]). At David's house, Julia is greeted by his ex-wife Tessa ([[Katherine Heigl]]), who is not coping with the end of their marriage two years earlier.\n\nThe next evening, Tessa drops something off at the house, and Lily insists she stays for dinner. Tessa criticizes Julia's cooking and leaves. Julia learns that her [[restraining order]] against Michael has expired, much to her distress.\n\nTessa is visited by \"Lovey\" ([[Cheryl Ladd]]), her controlling and belittling mother. Investigating Julia online, Tessa discovers her restraining order against Michael. She sets up a [[Facebook]] account impersonating Julia, and messages Michael, telling him how much \"Julia\" misses him.\n\nJulia receives a surprise flower delivery, sent anonymously by Tessa to make it appear Julia is having an affair. While Julia is at the door, Tessa sneaks in and steals David's watch, his grandmother's wedding ring, and a pair of Julia's panties. That afternoon, while Julia and Lily visit David at a farmer's market, Lily wanders off. Julia finds her in the arms of Tessa, who is complaining to David about Julia's incompetence as a mother. When Tessa shows up at the house, Julia confronts her for trying to reenter David's life. The women have lunch together in an attempt to reconcile, and Tessa claims that David left her was because he suspected she was having an affair. Tessa mails Michael the watch and panties.\n\nTessa tries to get Lily to ride an unruly horse at her [[equestrianism|horseback riding]] practice, but Julia notices Lily\u2019s fear and takes her home, to Tessa's annoyance. That night, Tessa pleasures herself in her car while sending [[sexting|sexually explicit messages]], posing as Julia, to Michael.\n\nTessa cuts Lily's long hair short as punishment for leaving riding practice early, leading to a heated argument with Julia. Tessa throws herself down the stairs and pretends Julia accidentally pushed her when David arrives. After taking Tessa to a hospital, David castigates Julia for treating his ex-wife so badly. Julia calls on Ali for help, and they discover Tessa\u2019s child services records; as a teenager, she attempted to kill her father when he cheated on her mother.\n\nTessa messages Michael, as Julia, saying she wants him to visit for sex. Michael enters the house when Julia is alone, and when she spurns his advances, he attacks her. A badly beaten Julia stabs him in the leg with a kitchen knife and escapes the house. Tessa, waiting outside, enters and stabs Michael in the chest.\n\nIn the present, the police release Julia, stating the investigation into Michael\u2019s death will continue. David is initially supportive after a tearful Julia explains her history with Michael, but when the police show him the \"evidence\", he becomes disillusioned and goes to Tessa's house to get Lily. There, he sees burned gloves in the fireplace and his grandmother's wedding ring on Tessa's finger, realizing that Tessa framed Julia.\n\nTessa knocks David out with a fireplace poker. Julia arrives and tries to call 9-1-1, but is attacked by Tessa. Subduing Tessa, Julia rushes to revive David, but Tessa attacks her with a knife. Seeing herself in a mirror, Tessa realizes the monster she has become and stabs herself in the stomach. Dying, Tessa begs Julia to not let Lily remember her like this.\n\nSix months later, David and Julia are married and have moved into a new house with Lily. Julia answers the door to find Lovey wanting to see her granddaughter. Julia looks on in horror as Lovey hugs Lily.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- all opening credit names/order, with roles per closing credits --->\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Julia Banks, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Tessa Connover, David's ex-wife\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as David Connover, Tessa's ex-husband and Lily's father\n* [[Cheryl Ladd]] as Helen/\"Lovey\", Tessa's mother\n* [[Sarah Burns]] as Sarah, David's friend since childhood\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Ali, Julia\u2019s best friend\n* [[Simon Kassianides]] as Michael Vargas, Julia's abusive and violent ex-boyfriend\n* [[Isabella Rice|Isabella Kai Rice]] as Lily Connover, Tessa and David's daughter\n* [[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]] as Detective Pope\n* [[Jayson Blair (actor)|Jayson Blair]] as Jason\n\n== Production ==\nOn January 9, 2014, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] had hired [[Amma Asante]] to direct the [[female]]-centric thriller ''Unforgettable''.

When Alia\u2019s (Mansha Pasha) husband, Noman Malik (Ali Kazmi), is murdered in a brutal target killing in Karachi, she seeks answers and revenge. Up against a lazy justice system, as well as a social structure that isn\u2019t kind to single women, she pushes ahead in fury. Finally, she comes across Adeel (Ahmed Ali), a cab driver with his own set of troubles. Adeel\u2019s dreams of going to Dubai aren\u2019t materializing, even though he indulges in petty crimes. After a chance encounter with Alia, he offers to find out vital information for her, in return for a hefty sum of money. The story isn\u2019t unlike that of many other crime films, and neatly brings together the lives of police officers, businessmen, petty thieves and murderers. However, the star of the film is Inspector Ibrahim (Rashid Farooqui), who easily switches between a loving family man and a corrupt police officer. When he tortures an informant, you curse him, but when he lets his daughter do his makeup, you absolutely fall in love with him. A police officer looks over a gate, shouting \u2018Oye Hello\u2019 at some criminals, and allowing them to run away. An inspector tries to wake up his wife, by pulling up her eyelids, and you laugh along as they both chuckle. Just when you think the film lacks emotional depth, you are offered the raw sadness of parents mourning their dead child, or the anxiety of a young man calming down his senile father. Meanwhile, deep in the winding lanes of a dense Karachi neighbourhood, Adeel (Ahmed Ali Akbar) tends to his aging father, drives a little red cab to make ends meet, commits petty theft and dreams of saving enough money to escape to the promised land: Dubai.\n\nAliya and Adeel's individual scheming and planning throws them together unexpectedly. Adeel offers to help Aliya find her husband's murderer. In exchange, she'll give him enough money to flee to the UAE. Sounds simple enough... but neither of them realise they're in over their heads.\n\nWhat follows is threats and torment and fear, gunfights and death, difficult choices and the potential unmasking of a corrupt empire.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*[[Ahmed Ali Akbar]] as Adeel Alam\n*[[Ali Kazmi]] as Noman Malik\n*[[Mansha Pasha]] as Aaliyah Malik\n*[[Syed Mohammad Ahmed]]\n*[[Rashid Farooqui]] as Inspector Ibrahim\n*Salim Meraj\n*Syed Arsalan\n*Hammad Sidiq\n*Ishtiaq Omar\n*Kaleem Ghour\n* Faiza Gillani\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\n''Laal Kabootar'' was filmed in [[Karachi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://veryfilmi.com/laal-kabootar-movie-will-be-the-first-ever-karachi-based-crime-drama/|title=Laal Kabootar Movie Will Be The First Ever Karachi-Based Crime Drama|last=Ahmed|first=Hira|date=26 November 2018|website=VeryFilmi|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> [[Ahmed Ali Akbar]] confirmed that the film was shot in Karachi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/in-conversation-ahmed-ali-akbar-shares-details-about-laal-kabootar/|title=In Conversation: Ahmed Ali Akbar shares details about Laal Kabootar|date=12 March 2019|website=Something Haute|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> The director Kamal Khan also confirmed the shooting areas.

When Alia\u2019s (Mansha Pasha) husband, Noman Malik (Ali Kazmi), is murdered in a brutal target killing in Karachi, she seeks answers and revenge. Up against a lazy justice system, as well as a social structure that isn\u2019t kind to single women, she pushes ahead in fury. Finally, she comes across Adeel (Ahmed Ali), a cab driver with his own set of troubles. Adeel\u2019s dreams of going to Dubai aren\u2019t materializing, even though he indulges in petty crimes. After a chance encounter with Alia, he offers to find out vital information for her, in return for a hefty sum of money. The story isn\u2019t unlike that of many other crime films, and neatly brings together the lives of police officers, businessmen, petty thieves and murderers. However, the star of the film is Inspector Ibrahim (Rashid Farooqui), who easily switches between a loving family man and a corrupt police officer. When he tortures an informant, you curse him, but when he lets his daughter do his makeup, you absolutely fall in love with him. A police officer looks over a gate, shouting \u2018Oye Hello\u2019 at some criminals, and allowing them to run away. An inspector tries to wake up his wife, by pulling up her eyelids, and you laugh along as they both chuckle. Just when you think the film lacks emotional depth, you are offered the raw sadness of parents mourning their dead child, or the anxiety of a young man calming down his senile father. Meanwhile, deep in the winding lanes of a dense Karachi neighbourhood, Adeel (Ahmed Ali Akbar) tends to his aging father, drives a little red cab to make ends meet, commits petty theft and dreams of saving enough money to escape to the promised land: Dubai.\n\nAliya and Adeel's individual scheming and planning throws them together unexpectedly. Adeel offers to help Aliya find her husband's murderer. In exchange, she'll give him enough money to flee to the UAE. Sounds simple enough... but neither of them realise they're in over their heads.\n\nWhat follows is threats and torment and fear, gunfights and death, difficult choices and the potential unmasking of a corrupt empire.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*[[Ahmed Ali Akbar]] as Adeel Alam\n*[[Ali Kazmi]] as Noman Malik\n*[[Mansha Pasha]] as Aaliyah Malik\n*[[Syed Mohammad Ahmed]]\n*[[Rashid Farooqui]] as Inspector Ibrahim\n*Salim Meraj\n*Syed Arsalan\n*Hammad Sidiq\n*Ishtiaq Omar\n*Kaleem Ghour\n* Faiza Gillani\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\n''Laal Kabootar'' was filmed in [[Karachi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://veryfilmi.com/laal-kabootar-movie-will-be-the-first-ever-karachi-based-crime-drama/|title=Laal Kabootar Movie Will Be The First Ever Karachi-Based Crime Drama|last=Ahmed|first=Hira|date=26 November 2018|website=VeryFilmi|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> [[Ahmed Ali Akbar]] confirmed that the film was shot in Karachi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/in-conversation-ahmed-ali-akbar-shares-details-about-laal-kabootar/|title=In Conversation: Ahmed Ali Akbar shares details about Laal Kabootar|date=12 March 2019|website=Something Haute|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> The director Kamal Khan also confirmed the shooting areas.
