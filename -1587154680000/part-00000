Being close to the Soviet Union and the [[Caucasus]], northern Iran became the primary center of underground Marxist and [[social democrat]] political activity, and many such groups came into being over the years.\n\nThe [[Communist Party of Iran (1920)|Communist Party of Iran]] was founded in June 1920 in [[Bandar-e Anzali]], in the province of [[Gilan]], as a result of the first congress of Iranian social democrats. [[Haydar Khan e Amo-oghli|Heidar Amou Oghly]], who was one of the leaders of the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran]], became the secretary-general of the new party. At the same time, [[Mirza Koochak Khan|Mirza Koochak Khan Jangali]], another major leader of the Constitutional Revolution and also leader of the revolutionary [[Jungle Movement of Gilan|Jangali]] (Foresters Movement), established the [[Soviet Republic of Gilan]] with the assistance of the [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Union.<ref>H. RamHormozi, ''Averting An Iranian Geopolitical Crisis: A Tale of Power Play for Dominance Between Colonial Powers, Tribal and Government Actors in the Pre and Post World War One Era'' (Victoria, BC, Canada: Friesen Press, 2016), 274.</ref><ref>Arutiun Airapetian and Marcelo Gryckiewicz, ''Transcaucasian Banknotes'' (BoD \u2013 Books on Demand, 2009), 190.</ref><ref>The [[United Kingdom|British]], who were a dominant influence in the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] court of [[Tehran]], reportedly sent agents to infiltrate the Foresters Movement in a carefully prepared plot.</ref>\n\nWith the defeat of both the newly formed Soviet Republic of Gilan and the Communist Party, Communist and social democrat activity once again went underground. In the early 1920s the Qajar dynasty finally collapsed, and [[Reza Shah]] ascended to the throne in 1925, establishing the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. The new Shah introduced many reforms, such as limiting the power of the [[Shi'a]] clergy, but also in turn established an [[authoritarian]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1929\u201330, the party organized strikes in an [[Isfahan]] textile mill, the [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] railways, [[Mashhad]] carpet workshops, and most importantly, in the British-owned oil industry. The government cracked down heavily and some 200 communists were arrested; 38 were incarcerated in [[Qasr Prison]] in Tehran. \"Seven died there - all from natural causes.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Along with the [[Purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Stalin purges]], which took a heavy toll from Iranian communist exiles living in the Soviet Union, these arrests meant the Communist Party of Iran \"ceased to exist for all practical purposes outside the walls of Qasr.\"<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'' by Ervand Abrahamian, (University of California Press, 1999) p. 28\u201329</ref>\n\n===Foundation of the Tudeh Party===\nThe British-Soviet [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Persian Corridor|invasion]] of 1941\u201342 resulted in the end of Reza Shah's reign and his forced exile to [[South Africa]]. Many political prisoners were subsequently released and under this new atmosphere, [[nationalist]] and [[socialist]] groups once again flourished. [[Iraj Iskandari]] and his closest colleagues decided to form a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] party appealing to the broad masses.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'' (2008) p. 107</ref> They founded the Tudeh party on 29 September 1941, electing [[Soleiman Mohsen Eskandari]] as chairman.<ref>Tudeh Party, [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.tudehpartyiran.org/2013-11-28-19-45-55/3312-2016-10-04-06-51-45&usg=ALkJrhihJ3cxamgvL1C8NuCMT9sGqG7fCA DOCUMENT CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE TUDEH PARTY OF IRAN ON THE OCCASION OF 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TUDEH PARTY OF IRAN], 2016</ref>\n\nInitially the party was intended to be \"a [[Liberalism|liberal]] rather than a radical party\", with a platform stressing the importance of \"constitutional\" and \"individual rights\", protecting \"democracy\" and \"judicial integrity\" from [[fascism]], [[imperialism]] and [[militarism]]. \"At Soleiman Eskandari's urging\", the party initially attempted to appeal to non-secular masses by barring women from membership, organizing [[Day of Ashura|Moharram processions]], and designating \"a special prayer room in its main clubhouse.\" This orientation did not last and the party moved \"rapidly to the left\" within months of its founding.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999), pp. 77\u201378</ref>\n\n===Early peak===\n{{see also|Coalition government of Ahmad Qavam}}\nIn 1944, the party entered the 14th [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]] elections and eight of its candidates were elected. It also established the secret [[Tudeh Party Military Organization of Iran]], or TPMO (''Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e Tudeh-ye Iran'') made up of officers in the military. The TPMO provided the party with intelligence and information from the military to protect it from the security forces and give it military strength, though historians believe the party had no plan at that time to use the TPMO to stage a coup.<ref name=\"Behrooz103\" />\n\nAt the same time, Tudeh took a strong stand in favor of women's rights, starting in 1943. This included advocating for equal pay for equal work, two months of maternity leave for female workers and otherwise standing for women's social rights, working with those who had been fighting for these goals for years and were [[socialist]].<ref>Women and Islam: Women's movements in Muslim societies, ed. Haideh Moghissi, p. 92-94.</ref>\nEven so, issues of [[reproduction]], [[sexuality]], and other elements within family life were not discussed.\n\nFrom this point on the party grew immensely and became a major force in Iranian politics. By early 1945, the party had managed to create the first mass organization in Iran's history. Police records later revealed it had an estimated 2,200 hard-core members \u2013 700 of them in [[Tehran]] \u2013 \"10,000s of sympathizers in its youth and women's organizations, and 100,000s of sympathizers in its labor and craft unions.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' (1999) p. 81</ref> Its main newspaper, ''[[Rahbar (newspaper)|Rahbar]]'' (Leader), boasted a circulation of more than 100,000 \u2013 triple that of the \"semi-official newspaper\" ''[[Ettela'at]].'' British ambassador [[Reader Bullard]] called it the only coherent political force in the country, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' reckoned it and its allies could win as much as 40% of the vote in a fair election.<ref>''Ettela'at'', 24 September 1979, quoted in Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'' (2008) pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nThis period has been called the height of the party's intellectual influence which came in large part from the prestige and propaganda of the [[Soviet Union]] as \"the world's most progressive nation.\" Few intellectuals \"dared oppose\" the party \"even if they did not join.\" Marking the end of the \"near hegemony of the party over intellectual life\" in Iran was the resignation from the party of celebrated writer [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]] circa 1948 to form a [[socialist]] splinter group \u2013[[Third Force (Iran)|Third Force]]\u2013 in protest against the Tudeh's \"nakedly pro-Soviet\" policies.<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p. 290</ref>\n\nTarnishing the appeal of the Tudeh in the next two years 1944\u201346 were Soviet demands for a [[petroleum]] concession in northern Iran and the Soviet sponsoring of ethnic revolts in [[Iranian Kurdistan|Kurdestan]] and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]. Despite the fact that Tudeh deputies in the [[Majles of Iran#Pre-Revolution Majlis \u2013 National Consultative Assembly|Majles]] had previously vigorously demanded the [[nationalization]] of the whole petroleum industry, the Tudeh party supported granting the Soviet petroleum industry in Iran its wishes on grounds of \"socialist solidarity\", \"internationalism,\" and \"anti-imperialism.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999) p. 82</ref>\n\n====International Cold War context====\nDuring this time the rest of the international communist movement was also thriving. The communist world expanded dramatically in the decade following [[World War II]] with [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], [[Division of Korea|North Korea]], and [[First Indochina War|Vietnam]] all becoming states dominated by their respective communist parties, usually via military victory. In the United States, Iran was seen as the holder of reserves of petroleum with \"vital strategic\" value to western countries,<ref>Byrne, p. 213</ref> and as part of \"a Northern Tier\" of countries (along with Greece and Turkey) that constituted a geopolitical \"first line of defense\" for the [[Mediterranean]] and for [[Asia]],<ref>Byrne, p. 214</ref>  To counter the activities of the USSR, the CIA established [[Operation TPBEDAMN]] in the late 1940s, funded at $1 million a year. It prepared both \"disguised (`gray` propaganda) or deliberately misrepresented [[black propaganda]]\" in the form of \"newspaper articles, cartoons, leaflets, and books\" which it translated into Persian, most of which \"portrayed the Soviet Union and the Tudeh as anti-Iranian or anti-Islamic, described the harsh reality of life in the Soviet Union, or explained the Tudeh's close relationship with the Soviets and its popular-front strategy.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, [[Syracuse University Press]], 2004, p. 243</ref> In addition it paid \"right-wing nationalist organizations\" and some [[Shia]] religious figures. Its agents provoked \"violent acts\" and blamed them on the communists, and hired \"thugs to break up Tudeh rallies.\"<ref>Byrne writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.217</ref> Nonetheless the party was able to fill the streets of Tehran and Abadan \"with tens of thousands of enthusiastic demonstrators\" for [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1946.<ref>Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'', 2003, p. 65</ref>\n\n===1949 crackdown===\nIn February 1949 there was an attempt on the life of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].  The party was blamed by the government and banned. The government \"confiscated its assets, dissolved affiliated organizations, especially the Central Council and rounded up some 200 leaders and cadres.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' (1999) p.84</ref>\n\nThe party continued to function underground however and by 1950 it had organized its supporters under the banner of the Iran Society for Peace (''Jam'iyat-e Irani-ye Havadar-e Solh'') and was publishing three daily papers, ''Razm'', ''Mardom'', and ''Besui-ye Ayandeh.''<ref name=\"Behrooz103\">Behrooz writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.103</ref> In December 1950, the TPMO, its military organization, managed \"to arrange for escape of key members of the party leadership who had been in jail since early 1949.\"<ref name=\"Behrooz103\"/>\n\nSuch suppression was assisted by conservatives detesting the Tudeh Party, which was later outlawed and allied with Mossadegh.<ref name=\"Michele Penner Angris 2011\">Michele Penner Angris, Party Building in the Modern Middle East (US: University of Washington Press, 2011),\n131.</ref> One Iranian conservative newspaper even editorialized:\n\n<blockquote> the Tudeh Party, with its santonic doctrine of class struggles, has incited ignorant workers to violate the sacred right of private property and inflict social anarchy upon the center of the country. This uprising proves that Tudeh is an enemy of private property, of Iran, and of Islam. If the government does not stamp out Tudeh, the local revolt will inevitably spread into a general revolution.</blockquote>\n\n===Mosaddeq era, his overthrow and aftermath===\n\nThe party played an important role both directly and indirectly during the pivotal era of Iranian history that began with the 1951 [[nationalization]] of the British [[Anglo Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC), and ending with the 1953 overthrow of [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]] by a [[CIA]]-led [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]].  The party's policy \"fluctuated,\" first attacking Mosaddeq as `an agent of American imperialism,` then giving him some support during and after the July 1952 uprising.  On 15 August a coup attempt against Mosaddeq was thwarted thanks in part to information uncovered by the Tudeh TPMO military network, but two days later party militants inadvertently helped destabilized the government by staging demonstrations to pressure Mosaddeq to declare Iran a democratic republic. As this would have overturned Iran's constitutional monarchy, Mosaddeq reacted by calling out troops to suppress the demonstrators. The party then demobilized late the next day making it unavailable to fight the coup the day after.<ref name=\"Behrooz121\">Behrooz writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.121</ref>  By 1957 the TPMO was crushed and thousands of party members had been arrested.<ref name=assassination>Doug Noble, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/07/19/assassination-nation/ Assassination Nation], [[CounterPunch]], 2012.</ref>\n\n====Oil nationalization====\n[[File:Tudeh leaders Soviet party Congress.jpg|thumb|300px|Senior members of Tudeh in 1955 (left to right): [[Reza Rousta|Rousta]], [[Fereydoun Keshavarz|Keshavarz]], [[Reza Radmanesh|Radmanesh]], [[Iraj Eskandari|Eskandari]] and [[Abdolsamad Kambakhsh|Kambakhsh]]]]\nFollowing World War II, Iranian public support was growing for nationalization of the British Anglo Iranian Oil Company (AIOC)<ref>Saikal, Amin, ''The Rise and Fall of the Shah'', (Princeton University Press, 1980), p.42. Note: AIOC later became [[British Petroleum]] (BP)</ref> whose profits had greatly exceeded its royalty payments to the Iranian government.\n\nIn 1951, [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]], head of the [[nationalist]] movement known as the [[National Front of Iran]], led parliament in the nationalization of AIOC, and shortly after was appointed [[prime minister]] by the Shah. Mosaddeq oversaw the takeover of British oil facilities and rising economic difficulty and polarization in Iran as the AIOC withdrew its employees and retaliated with a boycott of Iranian oil.<ref>Saikal, ''The Rise and Fall of the Shah'', (1980), p.43-4</ref>\n\nIn early April 1951 the Tudeh revealing its \"true strength\" by launched strikes and riots protesting low wages and bad housing in oil industry and delays in nationalization of the oil industry.<ref name=\"Michele Penner Angris 2011\" /> There were \"street demonstrations and sympathy strikes in [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], and the northern cities.\" Police opened fire on demonstrators. A result was \"panic\" in Iran's parliament at the power of Marxist forces in Iran.<ref>\"Abrahamian, 1982, p.266\"</ref> With this, it is clear that not only was Mossadegh not a communist but Tudeh did not control the government or want to overthrow him even as was establishing a broad public base.<ref>Ron Jacobs, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/15/the-coup-of-coups/ The Coup of Coups], [[CounterPunch]], 15 February 2013.</ref><ref>Vijay Prashad, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/07/01/iran-and-us/ Iran and Us], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 1 July 2009.</ref>\n\nDuring this period the Tudeh followed a \"leftist\" rather than \"[[Popular front#The Comintern's Popular Front policy 1934\u20131939|popular front]]\" strategy, refusing to ally with Mosaddeq. Despite the fact that Mosaddeq had introduced a new policy of tolerance toward the party,<ref>Azimi writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.72</ref> that both the Tudeh and Mosaddeq had worked for nationalization of the AIOC,<ref>Hussein Fateh, \"the anticommunist leader of the defunct Comrade's party\": Panjah ''Saleh-e Naft-i Iran'' Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'' (1982), p.320</ref> and that expropriation of [[capitalist]] Western-owned resource extracting corporations by [[developing countries|poor countries]] was central to [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine, the party vigorously and relentlessly opposed Mosaddeq and his program.  In a June 1950 article in its daily ''Mardom'' it described the effects of Mosaddeq's policy thusly:\n\n<blockquote>Already we can be sure that revisions in the southern oil contract will not be in favor of our people and will only result in the consolidation of England's position in our country. ...

Mosaddeq appealed to the general public for support, but Tudeh press continued to attack him, describing his differences with the shah \"as merely one between different factions of a reactionary ruling elite.\"<ref name=\"Behrooz, p.109\">Behrooz, p.109</ref> It was only after the explosion of popular support for Mosaddeq in the street that \"many rank-and-file\" Tudeh party members \"could see first hand Mosaddeq's popularity\",<ref name=\"Behrooz, p.109\" /> and came to his aid.\n\nAccording to one observer:\n<blockquote>although diverse elements participated in the July uprising, the impartial observer must confess that the Tudeh played an important part\u2014perhaps even the most important part. ...

On 15 August the plot was uncovered by Tudeh supporters in the military, and a contingent sent to arrest Mosaddeq were intercepted and arrested themselves. Colonel Mohammad Ali Mobasherri, was a member of the TPMO's (secret) three-man secretariat, but also an active member of Tehran Military Governor, the center of the coup operation.

These documents also noted that Eisenhower and Truman differed in their assessments of Mossadegh, with Eisenhower feeling he could not as effectively counter Tudeh as Truman and the CIA in August 1953 downplaying \"the likelihood of a Tudeh overthrow attempt\" but fears the Tudeh taking power in a more long-term fashion.<ref>[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB126/ Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran], ed. by Mark J.

The already anti-monarchical Tudeh supporters were radicalized and on the morning of 17 August \"an angry crowd began to attack symbols of the monarchy\" and demanded its abolition.  Mosaddeq, who was aware of Western fears of the Tudeh and who had worked to limit the power of the shah but had \"never suggested he was in favor of abolishing the constitutional monarchy,\" saw these attacks as a challenge, as removing the shah would violate the constitution.<ref>Behrooz, p. 119, 120</ref> The next day his regime ordering the military into the streets, and \"up to 600 mid and low-level Tudeh activists were arrested in Tehran alone.\"<ref>Behrooz, p. 120</ref> With its network \"severely damaging\" the party reversed course once again, and \"ordered a demobilization\" of its preparations to fight a coup.<ref>Behrooz, p. 121</ref><ref>Rostam Pourzal, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/08/21/the-left-and-iran/ The Left and Iran], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 21 August 2008.</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of the quiet, the CIA and its Iranian allies struck again, and on 19 August the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] replaced Mosaddeq with Zahedi.

With the eruption of the Sino-Soviet dispute, three Tudeh leaders left the party and formed a party called the Organization of Marxist-Leninists. At the same time, some members of the party's youth section left and formed the Revolutionary Organization of the Tudeh Party.\" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3012310?seq=3 Iran in Revolution: The Opposition Forces], Ervand Abrahamian</ref> In the mid 1960s, the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 1500.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H..

(Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the party faced a second division between the mainstream of the organization and the splinter faction, which advocated violent struggle against the government by arming the tribes of southern Iran. This faction caused a great deal of damage and three years passed before the unity of the party was restored. The remnants of this faction are known as the [[Labour Party of Iran]].\n\nIn 1966, several party members, including [[Ali Khavari]] and [[Parviz Hekmatjoo]] of the Central Committee, and [[Asef Razmdideh]] and [[Saber Mohammadzadeh]], were arrested and sentenced to death. This sparked international outcry and hunger strikes in Europe which forced the government to reduce the sentences to life imprisonment. These events created much international sympathy for the worker's struggle in Iran and helped unify the party after the split. The Tudeh Party from this point on becomes established as one of the strongest underground movements and helps to pave the way for the forthcoming [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.\n\n===Iranian Revolution of 1979===\nIn the early 1970s, the Iranian [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement began in northern Iran in the province of [[Mazandaran]]. The 1970s also witnessed the birth of widespread worker's strikes and demonstrations, and university campuses became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. In 1973, Tudeh released a brochure titled \"Oil from Iran and imperialist oil monopolies,\" likely advocating for oil nationalization.<ref>Brochure of the Iranian Tudeh Party, \"[http://www.iisg.nl/collections/crises/bro5647-4.php Oil from Iran and imperialist oil monopolies],\" Safari, Hamid: Impiryalism-i naftkhar.

However, the majority of seats in the Majlis were won by the [[Islamic Republican Party]] of [[Mohammad Beheshti|Ayatollah Beheshti]] and leftist and nationalist organizations were forced out of the loop. The newly elected President, [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], who had originally been close with [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], also became increasingly frustrated with the developments that had been taking place and opposed the domination of the clergy and the religious factions in Iranian politics. In addition, the party denounced Amnesty International's call to end the summary executions and called it \"blatant interference in Iranian affairs\".<ref name=mmm>{{cite journal|last=Milani|first=Mohsen M.|title=Harvest of Shame: Tudeh and the Bazargan Government|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=April 1993|volume=29|issue=2|pages=307\u2013320|jstor=4283563|doi=10.1080/00263209308700950}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the Majlis, dominated by the Islamic Republican Party, forced Bani Sadr out of office, which initiated a wave of protests and demonstrations from all segments of the populace. Bani Sadr later fled the country. Armed revolutionary committees loyal to Khomeini (which came to be known as the ''[[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Pasdaran]]'') arrested many thousands of youth and activists from both nationalist and leftist groups, many of whom were later tried by [[Lajevardi]], who was known as the ''Hanging Judge'', and executed.\n\nAt this point in the history of the Tudeh Party, the [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Azeris]] within the population were prominent.<ref>Michele Penner Angris, ''Party Building in the Modern Middle East'' (US: University of Washington Press, 2011), 71.</ref>\n\n====Suppression====\nWhile other leftist parties opposed the Islamist forces at this time, and were suppressed as a result, Tudeh Party leadership as well as the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaian Aksariat]] decided to oppose politically with the new clerical theocratic regime and support the crackdown on the militant armed opposition. This may have been to try to take advantage of the lack of competition from the many now suppressed rival leftist groups, or to follow the pro-Tehran line of the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1982, however, the Tudeh broke ranks. The Islamist government of Iran had closed down the Tudeh newspaper, and purged Tudeh members from government ministries. According to the [[Mitrokhin Archive]], [[Vladimir Kuzichkin]], a [[KGB]] officer stationed in Tehran, had defected to the British in 1982.

The simplest explanation came several years after the television recantations, from a prison visit by a [[United Nations]]' human rights representative (Galindo Pohl) to Iran. The Tudeh Party General Secretary [[Noureddin Kianouri]] was reported to have told the representative that he and his wife had been tortured to give false confessions.

Being close to the Soviet Union and the [[Caucasus]], northern Iran became the primary center of underground Marxist and [[social democrat]] political activity, and many such groups came into being over the years.\n\nThe [[Communist Party of Iran (1920)|Communist Party of Iran]] was founded in June 1920 in [[Bandar-e Anzali]], in the province of [[Gilan]], as a result of the first congress of Iranian social democrats. [[Haydar Khan e Amo-oghli|Heidar Amou Oghly]], who was one of the leaders of the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran]], became the secretary-general of the new party. At the same time, [[Mirza Koochak Khan|Mirza Koochak Khan Jangali]], another major leader of the Constitutional Revolution and also leader of the revolutionary [[Jungle Movement of Gilan|Jangali]] (Foresters Movement), established the [[Soviet Republic of Gilan]] with the assistance of the [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Union.<ref>H.

In the early 1920s the Qajar dynasty finally collapsed, and [[Reza Shah]] ascended to the throne in 1925, establishing the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. The new Shah introduced many reforms, such as limiting the power of the [[Shi'a]] clergy, but also in turn established an [[authoritarian]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1929\u201330, the party organized strikes in an [[Isfahan]] textile mill, the [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] railways, [[Mashhad]] carpet workshops, and most importantly, in the British-owned oil industry. The government cracked down heavily and some 200 communists were arrested; 38 were incarcerated in [[Qasr Prison]] in Tehran. \"Seven died there - all from natural causes.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Along with the [[Purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Stalin purges]], which took a heavy toll from Iranian communist exiles living in the Soviet Union, these arrests meant the Communist Party of Iran \"ceased to exist for all practical purposes outside the walls of Qasr.\"<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'' by Ervand Abrahamian, (University of California Press, 1999) p. 28\u201329</ref>\n\n===Foundation of the Tudeh Party===\nThe British-Soviet [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Persian Corridor|invasion]] of 1941\u201342 resulted in the end of Reza Shah's reign and his forced exile to [[South Africa]].

The TPMO provided the party with intelligence and information from the military to protect it from the security forces and give it military strength, though historians believe the party had no plan at that time to use the TPMO to stage a coup.<ref name=\"Behrooz103\" />\n\nAt the same time, Tudeh took a strong stand in favor of women's rights, starting in 1943. This included advocating for equal pay for equal work, two months of maternity leave for female workers and otherwise standing for women's social rights, working with those who had been fighting for these goals for years and were [[socialist]].<ref>Women and Islam: Women's movements in Muslim societies, ed. Haideh Moghissi, p. 92-94.</ref>\nEven so, issues of [[reproduction]], [[sexuality]], and other elements within family life were not discussed.\n\nFrom this point on the party grew immensely and became a major force in Iranian politics. By early 1945, the party had managed to create the first mass organization in Iran's history. Police records later revealed it had an estimated 2,200 hard-core members \u2013 700 of them in [[Tehran]] \u2013 \"10,000s of sympathizers in its youth and women's organizations, and 100,000s of sympathizers in its labor and craft unions.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' (1999) p. 81</ref> Its main newspaper, ''[[Rahbar (newspaper)|Rahbar]]'' (Leader), boasted a circulation of more than 100,000 \u2013 triple that of the \"semi-official newspaper\" ''[[Ettela'at]].'' British ambassador [[Reader Bullard]] called it the only coherent political force in the country, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' reckoned it and its allies could win as much as 40% of the vote in a fair election.<ref>''Ettela'at'', 24 September 1979, quoted in Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'' (2008) pp. 108\u201309</ref>\n\nThis period has been called the height of the party's intellectual influence which came in large part from the prestige and propaganda of the [[Soviet Union]] as \"the world's most progressive nation.\" Few intellectuals \"dared oppose\" the party \"even if they did not join.\" Marking the end of the \"near hegemony of the party over intellectual life\" in Iran was the resignation from the party of celebrated writer [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]] circa 1948 to form a [[socialist]] splinter group \u2013[[Third Force (Iran)|Third Force]]\u2013 in protest against the Tudeh's \"nakedly pro-Soviet\" policies.<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p. 290</ref>\n\nTarnishing the appeal of the Tudeh in the next two years 1944\u201346 were Soviet demands for a [[petroleum]] concession in northern Iran and the Soviet sponsoring of ethnic revolts in [[Iranian Kurdistan|Kurdestan]] and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]. Despite the fact that Tudeh deputies in the [[Majles of Iran#Pre-Revolution Majlis \u2013 National Consultative Assembly|Majles]] had previously vigorously demanded the [[nationalization]] of the whole petroleum industry, the Tudeh party supported granting the Soviet petroleum industry in Iran its wishes on grounds of \"socialist solidarity\", \"internationalism,\" and \"anti-imperialism.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999) p. 82</ref>\n\n====International Cold War context====\nDuring this time the rest of the international communist movement was also thriving. The communist world expanded dramatically in the decade following [[World War II]] with [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], [[Division of Korea|North Korea]], and [[First Indochina War|Vietnam]] all becoming states dominated by their respective communist parties, usually via military victory. In the United States, Iran was seen as the holder of reserves of petroleum with \"vital strategic\" value to western countries,<ref>Byrne, p. 213</ref> and as part of \"a Northern Tier\" of countries (along with Greece and Turkey) that constituted a geopolitical \"first line of defense\" for the [[Mediterranean]] and for [[Asia]],<ref>Byrne, p. 214</ref>  To counter the activities of the USSR, the CIA established [[Operation TPBEDAMN]] in the late 1940s, funded at $1 million a year. It prepared both \"disguised (`gray` propaganda) or deliberately misrepresented [[black propaganda]]\" in the form of \"newspaper articles, cartoons, leaflets, and books\" which it translated into Persian, most of which \"portrayed the Soviet Union and the Tudeh as anti-Iranian or anti-Islamic, described the harsh reality of life in the Soviet Union, or explained the Tudeh's close relationship with the Soviets and its popular-front strategy.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, [[Syracuse University Press]], 2004, p. 243</ref> In addition it paid \"right-wing nationalist organizations\" and some [[Shia]] religious figures. Its agents provoked \"violent acts\" and blamed them on the communists, and hired \"thugs to break up Tudeh rallies.\"<ref>Byrne writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.217</ref> Nonetheless the party was able to fill the streets of Tehran and Abadan \"with tens of thousands of enthusiastic demonstrators\" for [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1946.<ref>Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men'', 2003, p. 65</ref>\n\n===1949 crackdown===\nIn February 1949 there was an attempt on the life of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].  The party was blamed by the government and banned. The government \"confiscated its assets, dissolved affiliated organizations, especially the Central Council and rounded up some 200 leaders and cadres.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' (1999) p.84</ref>\n\nThe party continued to function underground however and by 1950 it had organized its supporters under the banner of the Iran Society for Peace (''Jam'iyat-e Irani-ye Havadar-e Solh'') and was publishing three daily papers, ''Razm'', ''Mardom'', and ''Besui-ye Ayandeh.''<ref name=\"Behrooz103\">Behrooz writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j.

This uprising proves that Tudeh is an enemy of private property, of Iran, and of Islam. If the government does not stamp out Tudeh, the local revolt will inevitably spread into a general revolution.</blockquote>\n\n===Mosaddeq era, his overthrow and aftermath===\n\nThe party played an important role both directly and indirectly during the pivotal era of Iranian history that began with the 1951 [[nationalization]] of the British [[Anglo Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC), and ending with the 1953 overthrow of [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]] by a [[CIA]]-led [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]].  The party's policy \"fluctuated,\" first attacking Mosaddeq as `an agent of American imperialism,` then giving him some support during and after the July 1952 uprising.  On August 15 a coup attempt against Mosaddeq was thwarted thanks in part to information uncovered by the Tudeh TPMO military network, but two days later party militants inadvertently helped destabilized the government by staging demonstrations to pressure Mosaddeq to declare Iran a democratic republic. As this would have overturned Iran's constitutional monarchy, Mosaddeq reacted by calling out troops to suppress the demonstrators. The party then demobilized late the next day making it unavailable to fight the coup the day after.<ref name=\"Behrooz121\">Behrooz writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark j.

However, the majority of seats in the Majlis were won by the [[Islamic Republican Party]] of [[Mohammad Beheshti|Ayatollah Beheshti]] and leftist and nationalist organizations were forced out of the loop. The newly elected President, [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], who had originally been close with [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], also became increasingly frustrated with the developments that had been taking place and opposed the domination of the clergy and the religious factions in Iranian politics. In addition, the party denounced Amnesty International's call to end the summary executions and called it \"blatant interference in Iranian affairs\".<ref name=mmm>{{cite journal|last=Milani|first=Mohsen M.|title=Harvest of Shame: Tudeh and the Bazargan Government|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=April 1993|volume=29|issue=2|pages=307\u2013320|jstor=4283563|doi=10.1080/00263209308700950}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the Majlis, dominated by the Islamic Republican Party, forced Bani Sadr out of office, which initiated a wave of protests and demonstrations from all segments of the populace. Bani Sadr later fled the country. Armed revolutionary committees loyal to Khomeini (which came to be known as the ''[[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Pasdaran]]'') arrested many thousands of youth and activists from both nationalist and leftist groups, many of whom were later tried by [[Lajevardi]], who was known as the ''Hanging Judge'', and executed.\n\nAt this point in the history of the Tudeh Party, the [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Azeris]] within the population were prominent.<ref>Michele Penner Angris, ''Party Building in the Modern Middle East'' (US: University of Washington Press, 2011), 71.</ref>\n\n====Suppression====\nWhile other leftist parties opposed the Islamist forces at this time, and were suppressed as a result, Tudeh Party leadership as well as the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaian Aksariat]] decided to oppose politically with the new clerical theocratic regime and support the crackdown on the militant armed opposition. This may have been to try to take advantage of the lack of competition from the many now suppressed rival leftist groups, or to follow the pro-Tehran line of the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1982, however, the Tudeh broke ranks. The Islamist government of Iran had closed down the Tudeh newspaper, and purged Tudeh members from government ministries. According to the [[Mitrokhin Archive]], [[Vladimir Kuzichkin]], a [[KGB]] officer stationed in Tehran, had defected to the British in 1982. [[MI6]] used this information and shared the information with the [[CIA]].

The simplest explanation came several years after the television recantations, from a prison visit by a [[United Nations]]' human rights representative (Galindo Pohl) to Iran. The Tudeh Party General Secretary [[Noureddin Kianouri]] was reported to have told the representative that he and his wife had been tortured to give false confessions. As evidence, he held up his badly set broken arm.

The Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers originated in Los Angeles, and subsequently member clinics opened throughout California and eventually other parts of the country, including Tallahassee, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. [[Women's health movement in the United States|Women's health movement]] historian Sandra Morgen notes, \"Until the National Black Women's Health Project\u2026 in the 1980s, the FFWHC was the only multiple-site group in the larger women's health movement.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Into Our Own Hands: The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1990. |last= Morgen |first=Sandra |year=2002 |page= 99|publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, NJ |isbn= 978-0813530710}}</ref> All member clinics provided abortion and gynecological health care, and worked together to \"espouse a unified ideology and identifiable politics.\"<ref>Morgen, 100.</ref>\n\nThe FFWHC member clinics stood out from others in the women's health movement because they adopted a more hierarchal model when other feminist clinics were operating as collectives. The debate and dispute over the FFWHC's mode of operation reached a point where some women's health centers refused to refer clients to FFWHC clinics for abortions. In 1990, [[Carol Downer]], founder of the Los Angeles FWHC and leader in the women's health movement, responded to the controversy: \"Most of the criticisms I've heard revolve around hierarchy\u2026 I might say it was the difference between being organized and disorganized\u2026 It's hard for me to understand why anyone who goes into a political arena doesn't want to be as organized as they can possibly be\u2026 if you really are serious about what you are doing.

The song features a whistler, as well as Jamaican instruments to illustrate the section called \"Montego Bay,\" in a Calypso genre.\n\nBloom's recording of the song appeared in the 1997 film ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]].''\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1970)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Kent |authorlink= David Kent (historian) |title= [[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970-1992]] |publisher= Australian Chart Book |location= [[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W. |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|Australia ([[Go-Set]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.0156&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.0156.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.0156|title=Item Display -

If the [[observable]]s don't commute they can't even be used to refer to any set of states, let alone refer to any unique state.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen atom, the <math>L^2, J^2 ,  L_z , J_z</math> don't form a commuting set.

It was established during 1857, the year of the first baseball convention, just too late to be a founding member of the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. [[Image:New York Mutual baseball player.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Picture of an unidentified New York Mutual player]]It was a charter member of both the first professional league in 1871 and the [[National League]] in 1876. Failing on the field and in the coffer, it declined to make its last western trip of the inaugural season. For the transgression it was expelled in December, and soon found itself defunct.\n\nThe Mutual club initially played its home games at [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], with the [[New York Knickerbockers]] and many other [[Manhattan]] clubs, but moved to the enclosed [[Union Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] in 1868. Though historically identified as \"New York\", they never staged any home games in Manhattan.\n\nThe Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869\u201370 after [[NABBP]] liberalization. They joined the first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], for its [[1871 in sports|1871]] to [[1875 in sports|1875]] duration. In [[1876 in sports|1876]], the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] initiated the [[National League]] and recruited its members from West to East, partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests. The Mutuals were one of eight charter members, six of whom were from the National Association. Weak (sixth place at 21\u201335) and cash-poor, the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West; and was expelled.<ref>[http://www.19cbaseball.com/leagues.html Baseball history]- Retrieved 2012-01-08</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1876, the Mutuals executed the first [[triple play]] in major-league history in a game against the Hartford Dark Blues.\n\nUnion Grounds proprietor [[William Cammeyer]], often listed today as the Mutual club owner, signed the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] to play at his Union Grounds in 1877.

The Mutual club declared itself champion.</small>\n|}\n\nThe '''Mutual Base Ball Club''' of New York was a leading American [[baseball]] club almost throughout its 20-year history. It was established during 1857, the year of the first baseball convention, just too late to be a founding member of the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. [[Image:New York Mutual baseball player.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Picture of an unidentified New York Mutual player]]It was a charter member of both the first professional league in 1871 and the [[National League]] in 1876. Failing on the field and in the coffer, it declined to make its last western trip of the inaugural season. For the transgression it was expelled in December, and soon found itself defunct.\n\nThe Mutual club initially played its home games at [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], with the [[New York Knickerbockers]] and many other [[Manhattan]] clubs, but moved to the enclosed [[Union Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] in 1868. Though historically identified as \"New York\", they never staged any home games in Manhattan.\n\nThe Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869\u201370 after [[NABBP]] liberalization. They joined the first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], for its [[1871 in sports|1871]] to [[1875 in sports|1875]] duration. In [[1876 in sports|1876]], the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] initiated the [[National League]] and recruited its members from West to East, partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests. The Mutuals were one of eight charter members, six of whom were from the National Association. Weak (sixth place at 21\u201335) and cash-poor, the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West; and was expelled.<ref>[http://www.19cbaseball.com/leagues.html Baseball history]- Retrieved 2012-01-08</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1876, the Mutuals executed the first [[triple play]] in major-league history in a game against the Hartford Dark Blues.\n\nUnion Grounds proprietor [[William Cammeyer]], often listed today as the Mutual club owner, signed the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] to play at his Union Grounds in 1877. The team was effectively a one-year replacement for the defunct Mutuals, and was sometimes called \"Hartford of Brooklyn\".\n\n==Record==\n[[File:1870 New York Mutuals.jpg|thumb|right|1870 New York Mutuals team photograph]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
