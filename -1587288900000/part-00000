The River and this crossing of it has defined the life of several generations of local inhabitants on both sides of the River. As the suburban outskirts of Sydney widen and come closer to the still distinct and distinctive Macquarie towns, the rich history of the area and its physical remains become increasingly important to the community's sense of identity. The Windsor Bridge is thus an important part of Windsor's history and identity.|Statement of significance, Heritage and conservation register, [[Roads & Maritime Services]], 21 October 2004.}}\n\n==Bridge replacement==\nIn December 2013, the [[Government of New South Wales]] gave planning approval to the construction of a new bridge to replace the existing 1874 Windsor Bridge that, due to safety reasons,<ref name=windsorbridge>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/windsor_bridge/index.html|title=Windsor Bridge replacement- Road Projects|publisher=Roads and Maritime Services|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref> have been disputed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-traffic/windsor-bridge-plan-a-political-folly-say-engineers-20130102-2c5j2.html|title=Windsor Bridge plan a political folly, say engineers|author=Saulwick, Jacob|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> The old bridge is to be demolished after the new bridge opens.

The approach road to the new bridge is proposed to be built along one side of the Thompson Square, Australia's oldest public square on a currently existing road. The new bridge proposal is objected to by in excess of 45,000 people, on the grounds that it will keep and increase heavy traffic in a historic town centre, destroys the town\u2019s character and heritage. Some who favour the proposal claim the new bridge would greatly reduce traffic congestion in the area, in direct contradiction to quite a number of government traffic studies and documents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-04/nsw-premier27s-office-accused-of-political-interference-in-win/5133396|title=NSW Premier's office accused of political interference in Windsor Bridge approval|author=Foschia, Liz|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=4 December 2013|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia}}</ref> In October 2015, a legal challenge to stop the new bridge failed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/roads-and-maritime-services-pursues-windsor-bridge-community-group-in-court-20151029-gkmiew.html |title=Roads and Maritime Services pursues Windsor Bridge community group in court |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 November 2015 |access-date= |author= }}</ref><!-- A [[Legislative Council of New South Wales|NSW Legislative Council]] inquiry found the project was \"very close to malfeasance\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} A search of the Committee's report located [https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/lcdocs/inquiries/2468/Report%20-%20Windsor%20Bridge%20replacement%20project%20-%2022%20August%202018.pdf here] could find no reference to the word \"malfeasance\".-->\n\nThe replacement three-lane bridge is expected to provide insignificant improvements in traffic flow and flood mitigation.
