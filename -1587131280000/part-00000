Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used.

This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity''). Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">{{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}}</ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen. \n\nFor reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see [[Blood gas tension]]).<ref name=\"Yacov2017\">  {{Cite book | authors= Yacov R, Derek K and Namasivayam A| title= Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (sixth edition)| year=2017 | chapter=Chapter 10 \u2013 Blood gases: technical aspects and interpretation | publisher=Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-323-39006-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Oxygen exchange in the womb==\nDuring pregnancy, the mother\u2019s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity''). Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

In the film, Bond fights to prevent an ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite weapon against [[London]] to cause a global financial meltdown.\n\nThe film was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which [[Timothy Dalton]] resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan.

While working for [[British Naval Intelligence]] as a [[lieutenant commander]], Fleming liaised with the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] to monitor developments in Spain after the [[Spanish Civil War]] in an operation codenamed [[Operation Goldeneye]]. Fleming used the name of this operation for [[Goldeneye (estate)|his estate]] in [[Oracabessa|Oracabessa, Jamaica]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1986, [[MI6]] agents [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] and [[Alec Trevelyan]] infiltrate a chemical weapons facility in [[Arkhangelsk]], [[USSR]]. While Trevelyan is caught and presumably killed by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, the facility's commanding officer, Bond manages to destroy the site before escaping. \n\nWhile undergoing an assessment nine years later, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Bond attempts to prevent [[Xenia Onatopp]], a member of the Janus [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]], from stealing a [[Eurocopter Tiger]] attack helicopter during a military demonstration in [[Monte Carlo]], but is unable to prevent the theft. Returning to London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring an incident in Severnaya, [[Siberia]], after the stolen helicopter turns up at a radar facility. An [[electromagnetic pulse]] blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and [[Mikoyan MiG-29|Russian fighter aircraft]], while knocking out all satellite systems in orbit above.\n\nThe newly appointed [[M (James Bond)|M]] assigns Bond to investigate, after it is determined the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] [[space-based weapon]], codenamed \"GoldenEye\". Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects Ourumov, now a general, had involvement due to the weapon system requiring high-level military access. Travelling to [[St. Petersburg]], Bond is advised by his [[CIA]] contact Jack Wade to meet former [[KGB]] agent-turned-gangster Valentin Zukovsky and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan, having faked his death at Arkhangelsk, and learns he is descended from the [[Cossacks]] who were [[Repatriation_of_Cossacks_after_World_War_II#Lienz|repatriated to the Soviet Union]] after collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II.\n\nLearning that Trevelyan seeks revenge against Britain for [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|betraying his people]], Bond is sedated before he can kill him, and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova, a survivor of the Severnaya attack. Despite escaping before the helicopter's destruction, the pair are captured by Russian troops and taken before [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defence]] Dimitri Mishkin for interrogation. The heated argument between the men leads Natalya to prove Ourumov's involvement in the use of GoldenEye, revealing that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko survived along with her, and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov arrives and kills him. Bond escapes, pursuing after him to rescue Natalya. The chase leads to a missile train used by Janus, in which Bond kills Ourumov, before escaping from the train with Natalya before Trevelyan destroys it.\n\nBond and Natalya travel to Cuba, after Boris is traced to a location within the island's jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp attacks them after they crash land, but Bond kills her during the fight. The pair soon uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish, and proceed to infiltrate it. Bond is captured while trying to rig explosives to destroy the base, and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to use GoldenEye to devastate London in order to conceal the theft of financial records from the [[Bank of England]]. While Natalya is captured as well, she manages to hack into the satellite and reprogram it to initiate [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric re-entry]] and thus destroy itself. When Boris loses his cool trying to undo her programming, Bond uses the moment to trigger a grenade, concealed in a pen, to allow him and Natalya to escape.\n\nTo prevent Boris regaining control of the satellite, Bond proceeds to sabotage the dish's antennae by jamming its gears.

While Trevelyan is caught and presumably killed by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, the facility's commanding officer, Bond manages to destroy the site before escaping. \n\nWhile undergoing an assessment nine years later, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Bond attempts to prevent [[Xenia Onatopp]], a member of the Janus [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]], from stealing a [[Eurocopter Tiger]] attack helicopter during a military demonstration in [[Monte Carlo]], but is unable to prevent the theft. Returning to London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring an incident in Severnaya, [[Siberia]], after the stolen helicopter turns up at a radar facility. An [[electromagnetic pulse]] blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and [[Mikoyan MiG-29|Russian fighter aircraft]], while knocking out all satellite systems in orbit above.\n\nThe newly appointed [[M (James Bond)|M]] assigns Bond to investigate, after it is determined the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] [[space-based weapon]], codenamed \"GoldenEye\". Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects Ourumov, now a general, had involvement due to the weapon system requiring high-level military access. Travelling to [[St. Petersburg]], Bond is advised by his [[CIA]] contact Jack Wade to meet former [[KGB]] agent-turned-gangster Valentin Zukovsky and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan, having faked his death at Arkhangelsk, and learns he is descended from the [[Cossacks]] who were [[Repatriation_of_Cossacks_after_World_War_II#Lienz|repatriated to the Soviet Union]] after collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II.\n\nLearning that Trevelyan seeks revenge against Britain for [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|betraying his people]], Bond is sedated before he can kill him, and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova, a survivor of the Severnaya attack. Despite escaping before the helicopter's destruction, the pair are captured by Russian troops and taken before [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defence]] Dimitri Mishkin for interrogation. The heated argument between the men leads Natalya to prove Ourumov's involvement in the use of GoldenEye, revealing that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko survived along with her, and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov arrives and kills him. Bond escapes, pursuing after him to rescue Natalya. The chase leads to a missile train used by Janus, in which Bond kills Ourumov, before escaping from the train with Natalya before Trevelyan destroys it.\n\nBond and Natalya travel to Cuba, after Boris is traced to a location within the island's jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp attacks them after they crash land, but Bond kills her during the fight. The pair soon uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish, and proceed to infiltrate it. Bond is captured while trying to rig explosives to destroy the base, and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to use GoldenEye to devastate London in order to conceal the theft of financial records from the [[Bank of England]]. While Natalya is captured as well, she manages to hack into the satellite and reprogram it to initiate [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric re-entry]] and thus destroy itself. When Boris loses his cool trying to undo her programming, Bond uses the moment to trigger a grenade, concealed in a pen, to allow him and Natalya to escape.\n\nTo prevent Boris regaining control of the satellite, Bond proceeds to sabotage the dish's antennae by jamming its gears. Trevelyan tries to stop him, and the ensuing fight between the two culminates in him being dangled below the antennae. When asked who his death is for, Bond admits it is for himself, before letting Trevelyan plummet to his death. Natalya soon rescues him in a commandeered helicopter, moments before the antennae malfunctions and explodes, destroying the base and killing its personnel, with Boris killed by ruptured liquid nitrogen canisters. After landing somewhere safe, the pair prepare to enjoy some solitude together, but are interrupted by the arrival of Wade and a team of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Marines]], who escort them to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo base]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] (007): An MI6 officer assigned to stop the Janus crime syndicate from acquiring \"GoldenEye,\" a clandestine satellite weapon designed and launched by the Soviets during the Cold War.\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Alec Trevelyan]] (006) / Janus: Initially another 00 officer and Bond's friend, he fakes his death at Arkhangelsk and then establishes the Janus crime syndicate over the following nine years.\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as [[Natalya Simonova]]: The only survivor and eyewitness of the GoldenEye attack on its own control centre at Severnaya.
