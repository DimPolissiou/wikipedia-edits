'''Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh''' is the [[head of government|chief executive]] of the [[India]]n state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. In accordance with the [[Constitution of India]], the [[Governors of states of India|governor]] is a state's ''[[de jure]]'' head, but ''[[de facto]]'' executive authority rests with the [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]]. Following elections to the [[Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly]], the [[Governor of Madhya Pradesh|state's governor]] usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh|government]]. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose [[Cabinet (government)|council of ministers]] are [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collectively responsible]] to the assembly. Given the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no [[term limit]]s.<ref>[[Durga Das Basu]].

Note: although the text talks about Indian state governments in general, it applies for the specific case of Madhya Pradesh as well.</ref>\n\nFollowing [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|Madhya Pradesh's reorganisation]] on 1 November 1956, 18 people have served as its chief minister. Twelve of these belonged to the [[Indian National Congress]], including the inaugural officeholder [[Ravishankar Shukla]]. The first non-Congress chief minister was [[Govind Narayan Singh]] who defected from the party and lead a [[Samyukta Vidhayak Dal]] government from 1967 to 1969. [[Digvijaya Singh]] of the Congress became the first officeholder to serve two full five-year terms. He was succeeded by [[Uma Bharti]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], Madhya Pradesh's only [[List of female Indian chief ministers|woman chief minister]]. [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] is the longest serving and current incumbent.\n\n==Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:50em\"\n!

He saw the [[Germanization]] of Polish territories [[German partition|controlled]] by the [[German Empire]] as the major threat to [[Polish culture]] and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]]. He favored the [[Polish Question|re-establishment of Polish independence]] by [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish [[middle class]]. During [[World War I]], in [[Paris]], through his [[Polish National Committee (1917-1919)|Polish National Committee]] he was a prominent spokesman, to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] for Polish aspirations. He was a principal figure instrumental in the [[Second Polish Republic|postwar restoration of Poland's independent existence]].\n\nDmowski never wielded significant political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality most of his life, Dmowski believed that only a homogenous [[Polish language|Polish-speaking]] and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]-practicing nation would be preferable as opposed to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski's]] vision of [[Prometheism]] which sought a multi-ethnic Poland reminiscent of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] instead. As a result, his thinking  marginalized other ethnic minority groups living in Poland, particularly those in the [[Kresy]] (which included [[Jews]], [[Lithuanians]], and [[Ukrainians]]). He remains a key figure of [[Polish nationalism]]<ref name=\"Walicki46\"/> and has been frequently referred to as \"the father of Polish nationalism\".<ref name=\"\u00c1rnasonDoyle2010\"/><ref name=\"Crago1993\"/> Throughout most of his life, he was the chief ideological opponent of the Polish military and political leader [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and of the latter's vision of Poland as a [[Intermarium|multinational federation against German and Russian imperialism]].\n\n==Early life==\nDmowski was born on 9 August 1864 in Warsaw's [[Kamionek]] district, in [[Congress Poland]] ([[Vistula Land]]), then [[Russian partition|part of]] the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/> His father was a road construction worker and later an entrepreneur.<ref name=psb213/> Dmowski attended schools in Warsaw, studying biology and zoology at [[Warsaw University]], from which he graduated in 1891.<ref name=psb213/><ref name=\"psb214\"/> As a student he became active in the [[Polish Youth Association \"Zet\"]] (''Zwi\u0105zek M\u0142odzie\u017cy Polskiej \"Zet\"''), where he was active in opposing socialist activists.<ref name=psb214/> The Zet had links with the ''Liga Polska'' (Polish League), which Demowski joined in 1889.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> A key concept of the League was ''Polsko\u015b\u0107'' (Polishness), instead of ''tr\u00f3jlojalizm'' (triple loyalty).<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> \n\nHe also organized a student street [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] on the 100th anniversary of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Polish Constitution]] of 3 May 1791.<ref name=psb214/> For this he was imprisoned by [[Russian Imperial]] authorities for five months in the [[Warsaw Citadel]].<ref name=psb214/> He was then exiled to Libua and Mitau in Kurland (Latvia).<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> After 1890 he was also developing as a writer and publicist, publishing political and literary criticism in ''[[G\u0142os (1886\u20131905)|G\u0142os]]'', where he became close friends with [[Jan Ludwik Pop\u0142awski]], who would be his mentor.<ref name=psb214/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> After his release from exile, Dmowski became quite critical of the ''Liga Polska'', accusing it of being controlled by Free Masons and being generally incompetent.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref>\n\nIn April 1893 Dmowski co-founded the [[National League (Poland)|National League]] (''Liga Narodowa''), and became its first leader.<ref name=\"psb215\"/> The group differed from the ''Liga Polska'' as Dmowski insisted that there could be one Polish national identity, leading him to attack regionalism as a form of dual loyalty that was weakening the Polish nation.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> The same concept also excluded minorities such as Jews from his projected Polish nation.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref>\n\nIn November 1893 he was sentenced to exile from the Vistula Land.<ref name=psb215/> Dmowski went to [[Jelgava]], and soon afterward in early 1895 to [[Lemberg]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (modern [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]; known as [[Lw\u00f3w]] to the Poles), where together with Pop\u0142awski he began to publish a new magazine, ''[[Przegl\u0105d Wszechpolski]]'' (''All-Polish Review'').<ref name=psb215/> In 1897, he co-founded the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National-Democratic Party]] (''Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne'' or \"''Endecja''\").<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> The ''Endecja'' was to serve as a political party, a lobby group and an underground organization that would unite Poles who espoused Dmowski's views into a disciplined and committed political group.<ref name=\"Zamoyski329\"/> In 1899, Dmowski founded the Society for National Education as an ancillary group.<ref name=\"Zamoyski329-330\"/> From 1898 to 1900, he resided in both France and Britain, and travelled to [[Brazil]].<ref name=psb215/> In 1901 he took up residence in [[Krak\u00f3w]], then part of the [[Austrian partition]] of Poland.<ref name=psb215/> In 1903 he published a book, ''[[My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka]]'' (''Thoughts of a Modern Pole''), one of the first if not the first nationalist [[manifesto]] in [[European history]].<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/><ref name=\"psb216\"/>\n\nIn ''My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka'', Dmowski was harshly critical of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for exalting the nobility and for its tolerance for minorities, which contradicted his principle of \"healthy national egoism\".<ref>Kossert p.91</ref> In the same way, he rejected liberalism and socialism for putting the individual ahead of the nation-state, which for Dmowski was the only unit that really mattered.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref> Dmowski argued that the privileged status of the aristocracy in the old Commonwealth had hindered national development, and what was needed was a strong sense of nationality that would unite the nation into one.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref>  He also attacked the Romantic nationalism of the 19th century for viewing Poland as the \"Christ of Nations\", instead arguing for a hard-headed national egoism.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref>\n\nDmowski opposed revolutionary means of fighting, preferring political struggle, and aimed for independence through increased autonomy.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> After the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Dmowski met with Colonel [[Akashi Motojiro]], the Japanese [[military attache]] in [[Sweden]] and spy-master for Japanese intelligence activities, in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in March 1904.  Although reluctant to collaborate with the Japanese, Dmowski agreed to Akashi's proposal that Polish soldiers in [[Manchuria]] might be encouraged to defect to the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].<ref name=\"Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War\"/>  He travelled to [[Tokyo]] to work out the details, and at the same time made a successful effort to prevent the Japanese from aiding a rival Polish political activist, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who wanted assistance for a planned insurrection in Poland, an aspiration which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.<ref name=psb216/><ref name=\"Zamoyski330\"/><ref name=\"Walicki25\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Dmowski moved to Warsaw, back in the [[Russian partition]] of Poland, where he continued to play a growing role in the ''Endecja'' faction.<ref name=\"psb217\"/> During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Dmowski favoured co-operation with the Imperial Russian authorities and welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s October Manifesto of 1905 as a stepping stone on the road towards renewed Polish autonomy.<ref name=Zamoyski330/> During the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection|revolt in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] in June 1905, the ''Endeks'', acting under Dmowski's orders, opposed the uprising led by Pi\u0142sudski's [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS).<ref name=Zamoyski330/> During the course of the \"[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|June Days]]\", as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a uprising is known, a miniature civil war raged between ''Endecja'' and the PPS.<ref name=Zamoyski330/>\n\nAs a result of the elections to the [[First Duma]] ([[legislative assembly]] in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the National Democrats won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland.<ref name=\"Zamoyski332\"/> Dmowski and the ''Endecja'' saw the Duma as a way of improving Congress Poland's position within the Russian Empire as he considered guerrilla war to be impractical.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref>  Dmowski himself was elected a [[Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] to the [[Second Duma|Second]] and [[Third Duma]]s (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within it.<ref name=psb217/><ref name=\"Walicki26\"/> He was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence on the Russian than the Polish deputies.<ref name=\"psb218\"/> Between October 1905-October 1906, over 2, 000 Poles were killed by Russian police and troops while in Warsaw there were 1, 000 death sentences handed down.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref> Though he was often denounced as a sell-out, he maintained that he undertaking the only realistic course of action for Poland under the circumstances.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref>\n\nOver time, Dmowski became more receptive to Russian overtures, particularly [[neoslavism]], warming up to the idea that Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy.<ref name=Walicki26/><ref name=psb218/> In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of [[Russification]] would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their [[Germanisation]] policies.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/><ref name=Walicki26/> He explained those views in his book ''Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska'' (''Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause''), published in 1908.<ref name=psb218/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/>\n\nThis was not a universally popular attitude, and in 1909 Dmowski resigned his deputy mandate to focus on an internal political struggle within ''Endecja''.<ref name=psb218/> He lost the election to the [[Fourth Duma]] in 1912 to a socialist politician, [[Eugeniusz Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] from the [[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Left]], who won with the support of the Jewish vote. Dmowski viewed this as a personal insult; in exchange he organized a successful boycott of Jewish businesses throughout much of Poland.<ref name=\"psb219\"/><ref name=\"Walicki28\"/><ref name=\"Michlic2006\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn 1914 Dmowski praised the [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]]'s [[Manifesto to the Polish Nation]] of 14 August, which vaguely assured the Tsar's Polish subjects that there would be greater autonomy for \"Congress Poland\" after the war, and that the Austrian provinces of East and West [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], together with the [[Pomerania]] province of [[Prussia]], would be annexed to the Kingdom of Poland when the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] were defeated.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=\"Zamoyski333\"/> However, subsequent attempts on the part of Dmowski to have the Russians make firmer commitments along the lines of the Grand Duke Nicholas's manifesto were met with elusive answers.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=Zamoyski333/> Nonetheless, Dmowski's pro-Russian and anti-German propaganda succeeded in frustrating Pi\u0142sudski's plans of causing an anti-Russian uprising, and bolstered his position as an important Polish political figure on the international scene, especially with the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Walicki26/><ref name=\"Walicki12\"/> In November he became one of the active members of the [[Polish National Committee (1914\u201317)|Polish National Committee]].<ref name=\"psb219\"/>\n\nIn 1915, Dmowski, increasingly convinced of Russia's impending defeat, decided that to support the cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].<ref name=\"psb220\"/> During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist [[Wickham Steed]]. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favorable impression on public opinion.<ref name=\"Zamoyski334\"/> He gave a series of lecture at [[Cambridge University]], which impressed the local faculty enough that he was given a [[honorary doctorate]].<ref name=psb220/> In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new [[Polish National Committee (1917-1919)|Polish National Committee]] aimed at rebuilding a Polish state.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=psb220/> That year he also published, at his own expense, ''Problems of Central and Eastern Europe'', that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats.<ref name=Walicki12/><ref name=psb220/> He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned for the creation of a number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, as well as non-Slavic Hungarians and Romanians) in its place.<ref name=\"psb221\"/> Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a [[Regency Kingdom of Poland]], with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).<ref name=psb221/><ref name=\"graniczny\"/><ref name=\"termination\"/><ref name=\"schimitzek\"/><ref name=\"dictatorships\"/><ref name=\"shatterzone\"/><ref name=\"grenzstreifen\"/><ref name=\"destruction\"/>\nIn 1917 Dmowski laid out a plan for the borders of a re-created Polish state; it would include [[Greater Poland]], [[Pomerania]] with [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Upper Silesia]], south strip of [[East Prussia]] and [[Cieszyn Silesia]].<ref name=\"politycznego\"/>\n\nIn September that year, Dmowski's National Committee was recognized by the French as the legitimate government of Poland.<ref name=Zamoyski334/> The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski's National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland's government a year later.<ref name=\"Macmillan209-210_212\"/> However, the Americans refused to provide backing for what they regarded as Dmowski's excessive territorial claims ([[Dmowski's Line]]). The American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] reported, \"I saw Mr. Dmowski and [[Ignacy Paderewski|Mr. Paderewski]] in Washington, and I asked them to define Poland for me, as they understood it, and they presented me with a map in which they claimed a large part of the earth.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan212-213\"/>\n\nIn part, Wilson's objections stemmed from dislike of Dmowski personally. One British diplomat stated, \"He was a clever man, and clever men are distrusted; he was logical in his political theories and we hate logic; and he was persistent with a tenacity which was calculated to drive everybody mad.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan210\"/> Another area of objection to Dmowski was with his [[antisemitic]] remarks, as in a speech he delivered at a dinner organized by the writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], that began with the words, \"My religion came from Jesus Christ, who was murdered by the Jews.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan212\"/> When British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] criticized Dmowski and the Committee, Dmowski saw this as a result of Lloyd George's representation of Jewish interests.<ref name=psb220/> He refused to admit a single [[Polish Jew]] to the National Committee, despite support for such a proposal from Paderewski.<ref name=psb221/> A number of American and British Jewish organizations campaigned during the war against their governments recognizing the National Committee.<ref name=Macmillan212/> Another leading critic of Dmowski was the historian Sir [[Lewis Namier]], a Jew who served as the British Foreign Office's resident expert on Poland during the war, and who claimed to be personally offended by antisemitic remarks made by Dmowski. Namier fought hard against British recognition of Dmowski and \"his chauvinist gang\".<ref name=Macmillan212/> In turn, Dmowski's experiences at that time convinced him of the existence of an international \"Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, unfriendly towards Poland and intrasigently hostile to his [''Endecja''] party\".<ref name=\"Walicki2930\"/>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:Polish territorial demands on Paris Peace Conference 1919.png|thumb|300px|Polish territorial demands at the Paris Peace Conference 1919 ([[Dmowski's Line]]) on ethnographical background and borders of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] 1772]]\n\nAt the end of the World War, two governments claimed to be the legitimate governments of Poland: Dmowski's in Paris and Pi\u0142sudski's in Warsaw. To put an end to the rival claims of Pi\u0142sudski and Dmowski, the composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] met with both men and persuaded them to reluctantly join forces.<ref name=\"Macmillan213\"/> Both men had something that the other needed. Pi\u0142sudski was in possession of Poland after the war, but as the Pole who had fought with the Austrians for the [[Central Powers]] against the Russians, he was distrusted by the Allies. Pi\u0142sudski's newly reborn [[Polish Army]], formed from his [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], needed arms from the Allies, something that Dmowski was much better suited to persuade the Allies to deliver upon.<ref name=\"Macmillan213-214\"/> Beyond that, the French were planning to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] of General [[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg|J\u00f3zef Haller]] \u2013 loyal to Dmowski \u2013 back to Poland. The fear was that if Pi\u0142sudski and Dmowski did not put aside their differences, a civil war might break out between their partisans.<ref name=\"Macmillan214\"/> Paderewski was successful in working out a compromise in which Dmowski and himself were to represent Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] while Pi\u0142sudski was to serve as provisional president of Poland.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Not all of Dmowski's supporters accepted this compromise, and on 5 January 1919, Dmowski's partisans (led by [[Marian Januszajtis-\u017begota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a failed coup]] against Pi\u0142sudski.<ref name=\"Urb 499\u2013501\"/>\n\nAs a Polish delegate at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the [[Versailles Treaty]], Dmowski exerted a substantial influence on the Treaty's favorable decisions regarding Poland.<ref name=Walicki12/> On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies' [[Supreme War Council]] for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant.<ref name=\"Walicki13\"/> At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he had little interest in laying claim to areas of [[Ukraine]] and [[Lithuania]] that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities [[Prussian Partition|taken by Prussia from Poland in the 1790s]]. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, the Polish claims to [[Silesia]] were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of [[Polish minority in Germany|ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany]] and that \"these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas\".<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the \"Blue Army\" to Poland via [[Danzig]], Germany (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create a territorial ''fait accompli''.<ref name=psb221/><ref name=Macmillan213-214/> This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Pi\u0142sudski was opposed to needlessly annoying the Allies, and it has been suggested that he did not care much about the Danzig issue.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen131-134_231-233\"/>\n\nIn regard to [[Lithuania]], Dmowski did not view Lithuanians as having a strong national identity, and viewed their social organization as tribal. Those areas of Lithuania that had either Polish majorities or minorities were claimed by Dmowski on the grounds of self-determination. In the areas with Polish minorities, the Poles would act as a civilizing influence; only the northern part of Lithuania, which had a solid Lithuanian majority, was Dmowski willing to concede to the Lithuanians.<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen131-134_231-233/> His initial plans for Lithuania involved giving it an [[autonomy]] within a Polish state.<ref name=psb220/><ref name=psb221/> This caused Dmowski to have very acrimonious disputes with the Lithuanian delegation at Paris.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen223-224\"/> With regard to the former Austrian province of East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Dmowski claimed that the local Ukrainians were quite incapable of ruling themselves and also required the civilizing influence of Polish leadership.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen225\"/> In addition, Dmowski wished to acquire the [[oil fields]] of Galicia.<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen225/> His support for that was however more lackluster than that for other regions, and he opposed Pi\u0142sudski's proposal of an alliance or federation with Ukrainians.<ref name=psb221/> From the Allied powers only the French supported Polish claims to Galica wholeheartedly. In the end, it was [[Polish-Ukrainian War|the actual fighting on the ground in Galicia]], and not the decisions of the diplomats in Paris, that decided that the region would be part of Poland.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen225-226\"/> The French did not back Dmowski's aspirations in the [[Cieszyn Silesia]] region, and instead supported the claims of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen238-240\"/> Dmowski for a long time had praised the Czechs as model for national restoration in face of Germanization, and despite his dispute with Czech political leaders, his opinion of the Czech people as a whole remained positive.<ref name=\"odbudowania\"/><ref name=\"historyczne\"/>\n\nForever a political opponent of Pi\u0142sudski, Dmowski favored what he called a \"national state\", a state in which the citizens would speak Polish and be of the [[Roman Catholic]] faith.<ref name=\"Biskupski2000-57\"/> If Pi\u0142sudski's vision of Poland was based on the historical multiethnic state that had existed under the [[Jagiellon Poland|Jagiellonian]] dynasty, which he hoped to recreate with a [[multinational state|multinational]] federation ([[Mi\u0119dzymorze]] federation),<ref name=\"Pilsudski: A Life For Poland\"/> Dmowski's vision was the earlier Polish kingdom ruled by the [[Piast Poland|Piast]] dynasty, ethnically and religiously homogeneous.<ref name=\"Biskupski2000-57\"/> Pi\u0142sudski believed in a wide definition of Polish citizenship in which peoples of different languages, cultures and faiths were to be united by a common loyalty to the reborn Polish state.<ref name=\"Snyder2003-144\"/><ref name=\"Zimmerman2004-166\"/> Dmowski regarded Pi\u0142sudski's views as dangerous nonsense, and felt that the presence of large number of ethnic minorities would undermine the security of Polish state. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], he argued strenuously against the [[Minority Rights Treaty]] forced on Poland by the Allies.\n\nDmowski himself was disappointed with the [[Treaty of Versailles]], partly because he was strongly opposed to the Minority Rights Treaty imposed on Poland and partly because he wanted the [[German-Polish border]] to be somewhat farther to the west than Versailles allowed. Both of these disappointments Dmowski blamed on what he claimed was the \"international Jewish conspiracy\". Throughout his life, Dmowski maintained that the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] had been bribed by a syndicate of German-Jewish financiers to give Poland what Dmowski considered to be an unfavorable frontier with Germany. His relations with Lloyd George were very poor. Dmowski found Lloyd George to be arrogant, unscrupulous and a consistent advocate of ruling against Polish claims to the West and the East.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen217\"/> Dmowski was very offended by Lloyd George's ignorance of Polish affairs and in particular was enraged by his lack of knowledge about river traffic on the [[Vistula]].<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen217/> Dmowski called Lloyd George \"the agent of the Jews\".<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen217/> Lloyd George in turn claimed in 1939 that \"Poland had deserved its fate\".<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Dmowski 1936.jpg|thumb|Dmowski, 1936]]\nDmowski was a deputy to the 1919 [[Legislative Sejm (Second Polish Republic)|Legislative Sejm]], but he attended only a single session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=\"psb222\"/> He reorganized ''endecja'' into a new party, [[Popular National Union]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Ludowo-Narodowy'').<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/> During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] he was a member of the [[Council of National Defense (Poland)|Council of National Defense]] and a vocal critic of Pi\u0142sudski's policies.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=psb222/> In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as [[Dmowski's Line]].<ref name=psb222/>\n\nWhen the time came to write a Polish constitution in the early 1920s, the National Democrats insisted upon a weak presidency and strong legislative branch. Dmowski was convinced that Pi\u0142sudski would become president and saw a weak executive mandate as the best way of crippling his rival. The [[March Constitution of Poland|constitution of 1921]] did indeed outline a government with a weak executive branch.<ref name=\"Steiner2005\"/> When [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], a friend of Pi\u0142sudski, was elected President by the ''Sejm'' in 1922, he was seen by many among ''endecja'' as having been elected with the support of [[Bloc of National Minorities|the parties representing the national minorities]], with the notable backing of the Polish Jewish politician [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]].<ref name=\"Walicki30\"/><ref name=\"Sokol1992\"/> After Narutowicz's election, the National Democrats started a major campaign of vilification of the \"Jewish president\" elected by \"foreigners\".<ref name=\"Sokol1992\"/> Subsequently, a fanatical National Democratic supporter, painter [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]] assassinated Narutowicz.<ref name=Walicki30/>\n\nHe was a [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from October to December 1923 in the government of [[Wincenty Witos]].<ref name=psb222/> That year he received the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] from the government of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]].<ref name=psb222/>\n\nIn 1926, in the aftermath of Pi\u0142sudski's [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup d'\u00e9tat]], Dmowski founded the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (''Ob\u00f3z Wielkiej Polski''), though he would find himself more of an ideologue than a leader, as he was displaced by new, younger politicians.<ref name=\"psb223\"/><ref name=Walicki31/> In 1928 he founded the [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] (''Stronnictwo Narodowe'').<ref name=psb223/> He kept publishing newspaper articles, brochures and books.<ref name=psb223/> With declining health, he mostly retired from politics by 1930.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/> In 1934, a section of the youth wing of the ''Endecja'' found Dmowski insufficiently hardline for their taste and broke away to found the more radical [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] (known by its Polish acronym as the ONR).<ref name=psb223/> His last major campaign was a series of political attacks on the alleged \"Judeo-Masonic\" associates of President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]].<ref name=Zamoyski347/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Dmowski Funeral9.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession]]\n[[File:Gr\u00f3b Romana Dmowskiego Cmentarz Br\u00f3dnowski 2015.JPG|thumb|Grave in [[Br\u00f3dno Cemetery]]]]\nIn 1937 Dmowski, previously leaning towards [[ancestor worship]], returned to the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"psb224\"/> Weakening in health, Dmowski moved to the village of [[Drozdowo, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Drozdowo]] near [[\u0141om\u017ca]], where he died on 2 January 1939.<ref name=psb224/>\n\nDmowski was buried at the [[Br\u00f3dno Cemetery]] in Warsaw in the family grave.<ref name=psb224/> His funeral was widely attended,<ref name=psb224/> with at least 100,000 attendees;

he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw socialism and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one.<ref name=psb214/><ref name=\"Walicki23\"/> Over the years he became an influential European nationalist thinker.<ref name=Walicki13/><ref name=\"Walicki14\"/>\n\nDmowski had a scientist's background and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion.<ref name=Macmillan209/> He once told famous pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] that music was \"mere noise\".<ref name=Macmillan209/> Dmowski felt very strongly that Poles should abandon what he considered to be foolish [[romanticism in Poland|romantic nationalism]] and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists.<ref name=Macmillan209/><ref name=Walicki15/> Dmowski was very much influenced by [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between \"strong\" nations who dominated and \"weak\" nations who were dominated.<ref name=Macmillan209/>\n\nIn his 1902 book ''My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka'' (''Thoughts of a Modern Pole''), Dmowski denounced all forms of Polish Romantic nationalism and traditional Polish values.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> He sharply criticized the idea of Poland as a spiritual concept and as a cultural idea.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> Instead Dmowski argued that Poland was merely a physical entity that needed to be brought into existence through pragmatic bargaining and negotiating, not via what Dmowski considered to be pointless revolts \u2013 doomed to failure before they even began \u2013 against the partitioning powers.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> For Dmowski, what the Poles needed was a \"healthy national egoism\" that would not be guided by what Dmowski regarded as the unrealistic political principles of Christianity.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> In the same book, Dmowski blamed the fall of the old Commonwealth on its tradition of tolerance.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> While at first critical of Christianity, Dmowski viewed some sects of Christianity as beneficial to certain nations, through not necessarily Poland. Later in 1927 he revised this earlier view and renounced his criticism of Catholicism, seeing it as an essential part of the Polish identity. Dmowski saw all minorities as weakening agents within the nation that needed to be purged.<ref name=Zamoyski329/><ref name=\"Walicki32\"/> In his 1927 book ''Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, Nar\u00f3d I Pa\u0144stwo'' (''Church, Nation and State''), Dmowski wrote: <blockquote>\"Catholcism is not a supplement to Polishness; its is somehow rooted in its very existence and to an important extent it even forms its existence. The attempt to separate Catholicism from Polishness in Poland, cutting off the nation from religion and Church, would mean destroying the very existence of the nation. The Polish State is a Catholic State. This is not because the vast majority of its inhabitants are Catholics or because of the percentage of Catholics. From our point of view, Poland is Catholic in the full sense of the word, because we are a national state, and our people is a Catholic people\".<ref>Kossert p.97</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the pre-war years, the history of Poland was contested terrain as different ideological forces pulled Polish nationalists in opposite directions, represented by Dmowski and Pi\u0142sudski.<ref name=\"dabrowski\"/> Throughout his career, Dmowski deeply disliked Pi\u0142sudski and much of what he stood for.<ref name=\"Macmillan209\"/> Dmowski came from an impoverished urban background and had little fondness for Poland's traditional elitist social structure.<ref name=Walicki14/><ref name=Macmillan209/> Instead, Dmowski favored a modernizing program and felt Poles should stop looking back nostalgically at the old [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which Dmowski held in deep contempt and should instead embrace the \"modern world\".<ref name=Macmillan209/> In particular, Dmowski despised the old Commonwealth for its multi-national structure and religious tolerance.<ref name=Macmillan209/> He saw the ethnic minorities in Poland (Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians) as a direct threat to the cultural identity, integrity and ethnic cohesion of Poland, directly in competition with the Polish [[petit bourgeoisie]] (small bourgeoisie, aka semi-autonomous peasantry) with which he identified.<ref name=\"Walicki15\"/> Dmowski argued that good citizens should only have one allegiance to the nation, and there is no middle ground.<ref name=\"Walicki1920\"/> In his ideal view of Poland there would be no ethnic minorities; they would either be [[polonized]] or forced to emigrate.<ref name=\"Modras2005\"/> The success of his nationalistic ideas, also adopted and propagated by nationalists in other countries (such as Lithuania and Ukraine) contributed to the disappearance of the tolerant, multiethnic [[Polish-Lithuanian identity]].<ref name=Walicki1920/>\n\nDmowski admired [[Italian Fascism]]. In the summer of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of articles admiring Mussolini and the Italian fascist model, and helped organize the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence.<ref name=\"BlamiresJackson2006\"/><ref name=\"Kunicki2012\"/> Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly imitate the Italian or German models.<ref name=\"Walicki31\"/>\n\n===Antisemitism, anti-Belarusianism, Germanophobia, anti-Lithuanianism, and Ukrainophobia===\n\nDmowski often communicated his belief in an \"international Jewish conspiracy\" aimed against Poland.<ref name=\"Pankowski2010\">{{cite book|author=Rafal Pankowski|title=The Populist Radical Right in Poland: The Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKSLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=conspiracy+Dmowski|date=February 25, 2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-15097-6|page=26}}</ref> In his essay \"\u017bydzi wobec wojny\" (Jews on the War) written about World War I,<ref name=\"odbudowanie\"/> Dmowski claimed that [[Zionism]] was only a cloak to disguise the Jewish ambition to rule the world.

Endecja's crusade against Jewish cultural values gained mounting intensity in antisemitism of the 1930s, but there were no major pogroms or violent attacks on the Jews in Poland until the German Nazis [[occupied Poland]] and made it [[Final Solution|their mission]] in 1939\u20131944.<ref name=\"radicalization\"/>\n\nIn his 1931 novel ''Dziedzictwo'', Dmowski wrote: \"A Jewish woman will always be a Jew, a Jewish man, a Jew. They have another skin, they smell differently, they carry the evil among the nations\".<ref>Kossert p. 98-99</ref> In his 1938 essay ''Hitleryzm a \u0179ydzi'', Dmowski wrote: <blockquote>\"The tool of the Jews was Wilson, who was concerned that the Allied troops did not cross the German border...Lloyd George stopped regions from becoming part of Poland as they were before: the great majority of our Upper Silesia, Malborg, Sztum and Kwidzyn, and also Gdansk. Lloyd George acted like an agent of the Jews, and nothing gave the impression that Wilson was any less dependent on them. The Jews therefore negotiated an agreement with German Freemasonry, who, in return for help at the conference on the border question, agreed to provide them with a leading position in the German Republic. Eventually, after the peace, the Jews worked for Germany and against Poland in England, American, and even in France, but especially stove so that Germany became less and less a German state and more a Jewish one\".<ref>Kossert p. 98</ref></blockquote> \n\nFor Dmowski, one of Poland's principal problems was that not enough Polish-speaking Catholics were middle-class, while too many ethnic Germans and Jews were. To remedy this perceived problem, he envisioned a policy of confiscating the wealth of Jews and ethnic Germans and redistributing it to Polish Catholics. Dmowski was never able to have this program passed into law by the [[Sejm]], but the National Democrats did frequently organize \"Buy Polish\" boycott campaigns against German and Jewish shops. The first of Dmowski's antisemitic boycotts occurred in 1912 when he attempted to organize a total boycott of Jewish businesses in Warsaw as \"punishment\" for the defeat of some ''Endecja'' candidates in the elections for the ''Duma'', which Dmowski blamed on Warsaw's Jewish population.<ref name=\"Paulsson21\"/> Throughout his life, Dmowski associated Jews with Germans as Poland's principal enemies; the origins of this identification stemmed from Dmowski's deep anger over the forcible \"Germanization\" policies carried out by the German government against its Polish minority during the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], and over the fact that most Jews living in the disputed German/Polish territories had chosen to assimilate into German culture, not Polish culture.<ref name=\"Paulsson41\"/> In Dmowski's opinion Jewish community was not attracted to the cause of Polish independence and was likely to ally itself with potential enemies of Polish state if it would benefit their status.<ref name=Paulsson41/>\n\nDmowski was also a vocal opponent of [[freemasonry]]<ref name=psb223/> as well as of [[feminism]].<ref name=\"Plach2006\"/>\n\n== Recognition ==\n[[File:Pomnik romana dmowskiego.jpg|thumb|Statue of Dmowski in [[Warsaw]]]]\nDmowski's life and work has been subject to numerous academic articles and books. [[Andrzej Walicki]] in 1999 noted that main sources on Dmowski are [[Andrzej Micewski]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1971), [[Roman Wapi\u0144ski]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1988) and [[Krzysztof Kawalec]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1996).<ref name=Walicki12/>\n\nSuppressed during the era of [[communist Poland]], after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Poland, Dmowski's legacy has begun to be more widely recognized.

The political commentator, Janusz Majcherek, wrote in 2005: \"Instead of a modern Conservative Party, such as was able to modernize Britain or Spain, we find in Poland a cheap copy of the ''Endecja'', in which an old-fashioned pre-war nationalism mingles with a pre-Vatican II Catholicism, united in its rejection of modernization and mistrust of the West\".<ref>Kossert p.102</ref> The German historian Andreas Kossert wrote in 2011: \"Dmowski remains the icon of the contemporary Polish political right\".<ref>Kossert p.100.</ref> Both of the Kaczy\u0144ski twins praised Dmowski as an inspiration and Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, when he was mayor of Warsaw, put up the statue to Dmowski.<ref>Kossert p.100.</ref>. \n\nFor his achievement for the independence of Poland and expansion of Polish national consciousness, he was honoured on 8 January 1999 by the Polish Sejm with special legislation.

He saw the [[Germanization]] of Polish territories [[German partition|controlled]] by the [[German Empire]] as the major threat to [[Polish culture]] and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had [[partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]]. He favored the [[Polish Question|re-establishment of Polish independence]] by [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish [[middle class]]. During [[World War I]], in [[Paris]], through his [[Polish National Committee (1917-1919)|Polish National Committee]] he was a prominent spokesman, to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] for Polish aspirations. He was a principal figure instrumental in the [[Second Polish Republic|postwar restoration of Poland's independent existence]].\n\nDmowski never wielded significant political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality most of his life, Dmowski believed that only a homogenous [[Polish language|Polish-speaking]] and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]-practicing nation would be preferable as opposed to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski's]] vision of [[Prometheism]] which sought a multi-ethnic Poland reminiscent of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] instead. As a result, his thinking  marginalized other ethnic minority groups living in Poland, particularly those in the [[Kresy]] (which included [[Jews]], [[Lithuanians]], and [[Ukrainians]]). He remains a key figure of [[Polish nationalism]]<ref name=\"Walicki46\"/> and has been frequently referred to as \"the father of Polish nationalism\".<ref name=\"\u00c1rnasonDoyle2010\"/><ref name=\"Crago1993\"/> Throughout most of his life, he was the chief ideological opponent of the Polish military and political leader [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and of the latter's vision of Poland as a [[Intermarium|multinational federation against German and Russian imperialism]].\n\n==Early life==\nDmowski was born on 9 August 1864 in Warsaw's [[Kamionek]] district, in [[Congress Poland]] ([[Vistula Land]]), then [[Russian partition|part of]] the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/> His father was a road construction worker and later an entrepreneur.<ref name=psb213/> Dmowski attended schools in Warsaw, studying biology and zoology at [[Warsaw University]], from which he graduated in 1891.<ref name=psb213/><ref name=\"psb214\"/> As a student he became active in the [[Polish Youth Association \"Zet\"]] (''Zwi\u0105zek M\u0142odzie\u017cy Polskiej \"Zet\"''), where he was active in opposing socialist activists.<ref name=psb214/> The Zet had links with the ''Liga Polska'' (Polish League), which Demowski joined in 1889.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> A key concept of the League was ''Polsko\u015b\u0107'' (Polishness), instead of ''tr\u00f3jlojalizm'' (triple loyalty).<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> \n\nHe also organized a student street [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] on the 100th anniversary of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Polish Constitution]] of 3 May 1791.<ref name=psb214/> For this he was imprisoned by [[Russian Imperial]] authorities for five months in the [[Warsaw Citadel]].<ref name=psb214/> He was then exiled to Libua and Mitau in Kurland (Latvia).<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> After 1890 he was also developing as a writer and publicist, publishing political and literary criticism in ''[[G\u0142os (1886\u20131905)|G\u0142os]]'', where he became close friends with [[Jan Ludwik Pop\u0142awski]], who would be his mentor.<ref name=psb214/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> After his release from exile, Dmowski became quite critical of the ''Liga Polska'', accusing it of being controlled by Free Masons and being generally incompetent.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref>\n\nIn April 1893 Dmowski co-founded the [[National League (Poland)|National League]] (''Liga Narodowa''), and became its first leader.<ref name=\"psb215\"/> The group differed from the ''Liga Polska'' as Dmowski insisted that there could be one Polish national identity, leading him to attack regionalism as a form of dual loyalty that was weakening the Polish nation.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref> The same concept also excluded minorities such as Jews from his projected Polish nation.<ref>Kossert p.90</ref>\n\nIn November 1893 he was sentenced to exile from the Vistula Land.<ref name=psb215/> Dmowski went to [[Jelgava]], and soon afterward in early 1895 to [[Lemberg]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (modern [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]; known as [[Lw\u00f3w]] to the Poles), where together with Pop\u0142awski he began to publish a new magazine, ''[[Przegl\u0105d Wszechpolski]]'' (''All-Polish Review'').<ref name=psb215/> In 1897, he co-founded the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National-Democratic Party]] (''Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne'' or \"''Endecja''\").<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> The ''Endecja'' was to serve as a political party, a lobby group and an underground organization that would unite Poles who espoused Dmowski's views into a disciplined and committed political group.<ref name=\"Zamoyski329\"/> In 1899, Dmowski founded the Society for National Education as an ancillary group.<ref name=\"Zamoyski329-330\"/> From 1898 to 1900, he resided in both France and Britain, and travelled to [[Brazil]].<ref name=psb215/> In 1901 he took up residence in [[Krak\u00f3w]], then part of the [[Austrian partition]] of Poland.<ref name=psb215/> In 1903 he published a book, ''[[My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka]]'' (''Thoughts of a Modern Pole''), one of the first if not the first nationalist [[manifesto]] in [[European history]].<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/><ref name=\"psb216\"/>\n\nIn ''My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka'', Dmowski was harshly critical of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for exalting the nobility and for its tolerance for minorities, which contradicted his principle of \"healthy national egoism\".<ref>Kossert p.91</ref> In the same way, he rejected liberalism and socialism for putting the individual ahead of the nation-state, which for Dmowski was the only unit that really mattered.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref> Dmowski argued that the privileged status of the aristocracy in the old Commonwealth had hindered national development, and what was needed was a strong sense of nationality that would unite the nation into one.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref>  He also attacked the Romantic nationalism of the 19th century for viewing Poland as the \"Christ of Nations\", instead arguing for a hard-headed national egoism.<ref>Kossert p.91</ref>\n\nDmowski opposed revolutionary means of fighting, preferring political struggle, and aimed for independence through increased autonomy.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/> After the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Dmowski met with Colonel [[Akashi Motojiro]], the Japanese [[military attache]] in [[Sweden]] and spy-master for Japanese intelligence activities, in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in March 1904.  Although reluctant to collaborate with the Japanese, Dmowski agreed to Akashi's proposal that Polish soldiers in [[Manchuria]] might be encouraged to defect to the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].<ref name=\"Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War\"/>  He travelled to [[Tokyo]] to work out the details, and at the same time made a successful effort to prevent the Japanese from aiding a rival Polish political activist, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who wanted assistance for a planned insurrection in Poland, an aspiration which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.<ref name=psb216/><ref name=\"Zamoyski330\"/><ref name=\"Walicki25\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Dmowski moved to Warsaw, back in the [[Russian partition]] of Poland, where he continued to play a growing role in the ''Endecja'' faction.<ref name=\"psb217\"/> During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Dmowski favoured co-operation with the Imperial Russian authorities and welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s October Manifesto of 1905 as a stepping stone on the road towards renewed Polish autonomy.<ref name=Zamoyski330/> During the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection|revolt in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] in June 1905, the ''Endeks'', acting under Dmowski's orders, opposed the uprising led by Pi\u0142sudski's [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS).<ref name=Zamoyski330/> During the course of the \"[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|June Days]]\", as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a uprising is known, a miniature civil war raged between ''Endecja'' and the PPS.<ref name=Zamoyski330/>\n\nAs a result of the elections to the [[First Duma]] ([[legislative assembly]] in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the National Democrats won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland.<ref name=\"Zamoyski332\"/> Dmowski and the ''Endecja'' saw the Duma as a way of improving Congress Poland's position within the Russian Empire as he considered guerrilla war to be impractical.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref>  Dmowski himself was elected a [[Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] to the [[Second Duma|Second]] and [[Third Duma]]s (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within it.<ref name=psb217/><ref name=\"Walicki26\"/> He was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence on the Russian than the Polish deputies.<ref name=\"psb218\"/> Between October 1905-October 1906, over 2, 000 Poles were killed by Russian police and troops while in Warsaw there were 1, 000 death sentences handed down.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref> Though he was often denounced as a sell-out, he maintained that he undertaking the only realistic course of action for Poland under the circumstances.<ref>Kossert p.95</ref>\n\nOver time, Dmowski became more receptive to Russian overtures, particularly [[neoslavism]], warming up to the idea that Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy.<ref name=Walicki26/><ref name=psb218/> In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of [[Russification]] would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their [[Germanisation]] policies.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-115\"/><ref name=Walicki26/> He explained those views in his book ''Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska'' (''Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause''), published in 1908.<ref name=psb218/><ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/>\n\nThis was not a universally popular attitude, and in 1909 Dmowski resigned his deputy mandate to focus on an internal political struggle within ''Endecja''.<ref name=psb218/> He lost the election to the [[Fourth Duma]] in 1912 to a socialist politician, [[Eugeniusz Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] from the [[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Left]], who won with the support of the Jewish vote. Dmowski viewed this as a personal insult; in exchange he organized a successful boycott of Jewish businesses throughout much of Poland.<ref name=\"psb219\"/><ref name=\"Walicki28\"/><ref name=\"Michlic2006\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn 1914 Dmowski praised the [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]]'s [[Manifesto to the Polish Nation]] of 14 August, which vaguely assured the Tsar's Polish subjects that there would be greater autonomy for \"Congress Poland\" after the war, and that the Austrian provinces of East and West [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], together with the [[Pomerania]] province of [[Prussia]], would be annexed to the Kingdom of Poland when the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] were defeated.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=\"Zamoyski333\"/> However, subsequent attempts on the part of Dmowski to have the Russians make firmer commitments along the lines of the Grand Duke Nicholas's manifesto were met with elusive answers.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=Zamoyski333/> Nonetheless, Dmowski's pro-Russian and anti-German propaganda succeeded in frustrating Pi\u0142sudski's plans of causing an anti-Russian uprising, and bolstered his position as an important Polish political figure on the international scene, especially with the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Walicki26/><ref name=\"Walicki12\"/> In November he became one of the active members of the [[Polish National Committee (1914\u201317)|Polish National Committee]].<ref name=\"psb219\"/>\n\nIn 1915, Dmowski, increasingly convinced of Russia's impending defeat, decided that to support the cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].<ref name=\"psb220\"/> During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist [[Wickham Steed]]. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favorable impression on public opinion.<ref name=\"Zamoyski334\"/> He gave a series of lecture at [[Cambridge University]], which impressed the local faculty enough that he was given a [[honorary doctorate]].<ref name=psb220/> In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new [[Polish National Committee (1917-1919)|Polish National Committee]] aimed at rebuilding a Polish state.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=psb220/> That year he also published, at his own expense, ''Problems of Central and Eastern Europe'', that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats.<ref name=Walicki12/><ref name=psb220/> He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned for the creation of a number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, as well as non-Slavic Hungarians and Romanians) in its place.<ref name=\"psb221\"/> Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a [[Regency Kingdom of Poland]], with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).<ref name=psb221/><ref name=\"graniczny\"/><ref name=\"termination\"/><ref name=\"schimitzek\"/><ref name=\"dictatorships\"/><ref name=\"shatterzone\"/><ref name=\"grenzstreifen\"/><ref name=\"destruction\"/>\nIn 1917 Dmowski laid out a plan for the borders of a re-created Polish state; it would include [[Greater Poland]], [[Pomerania]] with [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Upper Silesia]], south strip of [[East Prussia]] and [[Cieszyn Silesia]].<ref name=\"politycznego\"/>\n\nIn September that year, Dmowski's National Committee was recognized by the French as the legitimate government of Poland.<ref name=Zamoyski334/> The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski's National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland's government a year later.<ref name=\"Macmillan209-210_212\"/> However, the Americans refused to provide backing for what they regarded as Dmowski's excessive territorial claims ([[Dmowski's Line]]). The American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] reported, \"I saw Mr. Dmowski and [[Ignacy Paderewski|Mr. Paderewski]] in Washington, and I asked them to define Poland for me, as they understood it, and they presented me with a map in which they claimed a large part of the earth.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan212-213\"/>\n\nIn part, Wilson's objections stemmed from dislike of Dmowski personally. One British diplomat stated, \"He was a clever man, and clever men are distrusted; he was logical in his political theories and we hate logic; and he was persistent with a tenacity which was calculated to drive everybody mad.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan210\"/> Another area of objection to Dmowski was with his [[antisemitic]] remarks, as in a speech he delivered at a dinner organized by the writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], that began with the words, \"My religion came from Jesus Christ, who was murdered by the Jews.\"<ref name=\"Macmillan212\"/> When British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] criticized Dmowski and the Committee, Dmowski saw this as a result of Lloyd George's representation of Jewish interests.<ref name=psb220/> He refused to admit a single [[Polish Jew]] to the National Committee, despite support for such a proposal from Paderewski.<ref name=psb221/> A number of American and British Jewish organizations campaigned during the war against their governments recognizing the National Committee.<ref name=Macmillan212/> Another leading critic of Dmowski was the historian Sir [[Lewis Namier]], a Jew who served as the British Foreign Office's resident expert on Poland during the war, and who claimed to be personally offended by antisemitic remarks made by Dmowski. Namier fought hard against British recognition of Dmowski and \"his chauvinist gang\".<ref name=Macmillan212/> In turn, Dmowski's experiences at that time convinced him of the existence of an international \"Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, unfriendly towards Poland and intrasigently hostile to his [''Endecja''] party\".<ref name=\"Walicki2930\"/>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:Liniadmowskiego.png|thumb|Borders proposed for Poland by Dmowski at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] (the [[Dmowski Line]])]]\nAt the end of the World War, two governments claimed to be the legitimate governments of Poland: Dmowski's in Paris and Pi\u0142sudski's in Warsaw. To put an end to the rival claims of Pi\u0142sudski and Dmowski, the composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] met with both men and persuaded them to reluctantly join forces.<ref name=\"Macmillan213\"/> Both men had something that the other needed. Pi\u0142sudski was in possession of Poland after the war, but as the Pole who had fought with the Austrians for the [[Central Powers]] against the Russians, he was distrusted by the Allies. Pi\u0142sudski's newly reborn [[Polish Army]], formed from his [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], needed arms from the Allies, something that Dmowski was much better suited to persuade the Allies to deliver upon.<ref name=\"Macmillan213-214\"/> Beyond that, the French were planning to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] of General [[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg|J\u00f3zef Haller]] \u2013 loyal to Dmowski \u2013 back to Poland. The fear was that if Pi\u0142sudski and Dmowski did not put aside their differences, a civil war might break out between their partisans.<ref name=\"Macmillan214\"/> Paderewski was successful in working out a compromise in which Dmowski and himself were to represent Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] while Pi\u0142sudski was to serve as provisional president of Poland.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Not all of Dmowski's supporters accepted this compromise, and on 5 January 1919, Dmowski's partisans (led by [[Marian Januszajtis-\u017begota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a failed coup]] against Pi\u0142sudski.<ref name=\"Urb 499\u2013501\"/>\n\nAs a Polish delegate at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the [[Versailles Treaty]], Dmowski exerted a substantial influence on the Treaty's favorable decisions regarding Poland.<ref name=Walicki12/> On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies' [[Supreme War Council]] for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant.<ref name=\"Walicki13\"/> At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he had little interest in laying claim to areas of [[Ukraine]] and [[Lithuania]] that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities [[Prussian Partition|taken by Prussia from Poland in the 1790s]]. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, the Polish claims to [[Silesia]] were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of [[Polish minority in Germany|ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany]] and that \"these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas\".<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the \"Blue Army\" to Poland via [[Danzig]], Germany (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create a territorial ''fait accompli''.<ref name=psb221/><ref name=Macmillan213-214/> This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land.<ref name=Macmillan213-214/> Pi\u0142sudski was opposed to needlessly annoying the Allies, and it has been suggested that he did not care much about the Danzig issue.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen131-134_231-233\"/>\n\nIn regard to [[Lithuania]], Dmowski did not view Lithuanians as having a strong national identity, and viewed their social organization as tribal. Those areas of Lithuania that had either Polish majorities or minorities were claimed by Dmowski on the grounds of self-determination. In the areas with Polish minorities, the Poles would act as a civilizing influence; only the northern part of Lithuania, which had a solid Lithuanian majority, was Dmowski willing to concede to the Lithuanians.<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen131-134_231-233/> His initial plans for Lithuania involved giving it an [[autonomy]] within a Polish state.<ref name=psb220/><ref name=psb221/> This caused Dmowski to have very acrimonious disputes with the Lithuanian delegation at Paris.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen223-224\"/> With regard to the former Austrian province of East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Dmowski claimed that the local Ukrainians were quite incapable of ruling themselves and also required the civilizing influence of Polish leadership.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen225\"/> In addition, Dmowski wished to acquire the [[oil fields]] of Galicia.<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen225/> His support for that was however more lackluster than that for other regions, and he opposed Pi\u0142sudski's proposal of an alliance or federation with Ukrainians.<ref name=psb221/> From the Allied powers only the French supported Polish claims to Galica wholeheartedly. In the end, it was [[Polish-Ukrainian War|the actual fighting on the ground in Galicia]], and not the decisions of the diplomats in Paris, that decided that the region would be part of Poland.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen225-226\"/> The French did not back Dmowski's aspirations in the [[Cieszyn Silesia]] region, and instead supported the claims of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen238-240\"/> Dmowski for a long time had praised the Czechs as model for national restoration in face of Germanization, and despite his dispute with Czech political leaders, his opinion of the Czech people as a whole remained positive.<ref name=\"odbudowania\"/><ref name=\"historyczne\"/>\n\nForever a political opponent of Pi\u0142sudski, Dmowski favored what he called a \"national state\", a state in which the citizens would speak Polish and be of the [[Roman Catholic]] faith.<ref name=\"Biskupski2000-57\"/> If Pi\u0142sudski's vision of Poland was based on the historical multiethnic state that had existed under the [[Jagiellon Poland|Jagiellonian]] dynasty, which he hoped to recreate with a [[multinational state|multinational]] federation ([[Mi\u0119dzymorze]] federation),<ref name=\"Pilsudski: A Life For Poland\"/> Dmowski's vision was the earlier Polish kingdom ruled by the [[Piast Poland|Piast]] dynasty, ethnically and religiously homogeneous.<ref name=\"Biskupski2000-57\"/> Pi\u0142sudski believed in a wide definition of Polish citizenship in which peoples of different languages, cultures and faiths were to be united by a common loyalty to the reborn Polish state.<ref name=\"Snyder2003-144\"/><ref name=\"Zimmerman2004-166\"/> Dmowski regarded Pi\u0142sudski's views as dangerous nonsense, and felt that the presence of large number of ethnic minorities would undermine the security of Polish state. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], he argued strenuously against the [[Minority Rights Treaty]] forced on Poland by the Allies.\n\nDmowski himself was disappointed with the [[Treaty of Versailles]], partly because he was strongly opposed to the Minority Rights Treaty imposed on Poland and partly because he wanted the [[German-Polish border]] to be somewhat farther to the west than Versailles allowed. Both of these disappointments Dmowski blamed on what he claimed was the \"international Jewish conspiracy\". Throughout his life, Dmowski maintained that the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] had been bribed by a syndicate of German-Jewish financiers to give Poland what Dmowski considered to be an unfavorable frontier with Germany. His relations with Lloyd George were very poor. Dmowski found Lloyd George to be arrogant, unscrupulous and a consistent advocate of ruling against Polish claims to the West and the East.<ref name=\"Lundgreen-Nielsen217\"/> Dmowski was very offended by Lloyd George's ignorance of Polish affairs and in particular was enraged by his lack of knowledge about river traffic on the [[Vistula]].<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen217/> Dmowski called Lloyd George \"the agent of the Jews\".<ref name=Lundgreen-Nielsen217/> Lloyd George in turn claimed in 1939 that \"Poland had deserved its fate\".<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Dmowski 1936.jpg|thumb|Dmowski, 1936]]\nDmowski was a deputy to the 1919 [[Legislative Sejm (Second Polish Republic)|Legislative Sejm]], but he attended only a single session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=\"psb222\"/> He reorganized ''endecja'' into a new party, [[Popular National Union]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Ludowo-Narodowy'').<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/> During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] he was a member of the [[Council of National Defense (Poland)|Council of National Defense]] and a vocal critic of Pi\u0142sudski's policies.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/><ref name=psb222/> In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as [[Dmowski's Line]].<ref name=psb222/>\n\nWhen the time came to write a Polish constitution in the early 1920s, the National Democrats insisted upon a weak presidency and strong legislative branch. Dmowski was convinced that Pi\u0142sudski would become president and saw a weak executive mandate as the best way of crippling his rival. The [[March Constitution of Poland|constitution of 1921]] did indeed outline a government with a weak executive branch.<ref name=\"Steiner2005\"/> When [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], a friend of Pi\u0142sudski, was elected President by the ''Sejm'' in 1922, he was seen by many among ''endecja'' as having been elected with the support of [[Bloc of National Minorities|the parties representing the national minorities]], with the notable backing of the Polish Jewish politician [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]].<ref name=\"Walicki30\"/><ref name=\"Sokol1992\"/> After Narutowicz's election, the National Democrats started a major campaign of vilification of the \"Jewish president\" elected by \"foreigners\".<ref name=\"Sokol1992\"/> Subsequently, a fanatical National Democratic supporter, painter [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]] assassinated Narutowicz.<ref name=Walicki30/>\n\nHe was a [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from October to December 1923 in the government of [[Wincenty Witos]].<ref name=psb222/> That year he received the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] from the government of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]].<ref name=psb222/>\n\nIn 1926, in the aftermath of Pi\u0142sudski's [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup d'\u00e9tat]], Dmowski founded the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (''Ob\u00f3z Wielkiej Polski''), though he would find himself more of an ideologue than a leader, as he was displaced by new, younger politicians.<ref name=\"psb223\"/><ref name=Walicki31/> In 1928 he founded the [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] (''Stronnictwo Narodowe'').<ref name=psb223/> He kept publishing newspaper articles, brochures and books.<ref name=psb223/> With declining health, he mostly retired from politics by 1930.<ref name=\"Lerski1996-116\"/> In 1934, a section of the youth wing of the ''Endecja'' found Dmowski insufficiently hardline for their taste and broke away to found the more radical [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] (known by its Polish acronym as the ONR).<ref name=psb223/> His last major campaign was a series of political attacks on the alleged \"Judeo-Masonic\" associates of President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]].<ref name=Zamoyski347/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Dmowski Funeral9.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession]]\n[[File:Gr\u00f3b Romana Dmowskiego Cmentarz Br\u00f3dnowski 2015.JPG|thumb|Grave in [[Br\u00f3dno Cemetery]]]]\nIn 1937 Dmowski, previously leaning towards [[ancestor worship]], returned to the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"psb224\"/> Weakening in health, Dmowski moved to the village of [[Drozdowo, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Drozdowo]] near [[\u0141om\u017ca]], where he died on 2 January 1939.<ref name=psb224/>\n\nDmowski was buried at the [[Br\u00f3dno Cemetery]] in Warsaw in the family grave.<ref name=psb224/> His funeral was widely attended,<ref name=psb224/> with at least 100,000 attendees;

he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw socialism and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one.<ref name=psb214/><ref name=\"Walicki23\"/> Over the years he became an influential European nationalist thinker.<ref name=Walicki13/><ref name=\"Walicki14\"/>\n\nDmowski had a scientist's background and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion.<ref name=Macmillan209/> He once told famous pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] that music was \"mere noise\".<ref name=Macmillan209/> Dmowski felt very strongly that Poles should abandon what he considered to be foolish [[romanticism in Poland|romantic nationalism]] and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists.<ref name=Macmillan209/><ref name=Walicki15/> Dmowski was very much influenced by [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between \"strong\" nations who dominated and \"weak\" nations who were dominated.<ref name=Macmillan209/>\n\nIn his 1902 book ''My\u015bli nowoczesnego Polaka'' (''Thoughts of a Modern Pole''), Dmowski denounced all forms of Polish Romantic nationalism and traditional Polish values.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> He sharply criticized the idea of Poland as a spiritual concept and as a cultural idea.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> Instead Dmowski argued that Poland was merely a physical entity that needed to be brought into existence through pragmatic bargaining and negotiating, not via what Dmowski considered to be pointless revolts \u2013 doomed to failure before they even began \u2013 against the partitioning powers.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> For Dmowski, what the Poles needed was a \"healthy national egoism\" that would not be guided by what Dmowski regarded as the unrealistic political principles of Christianity.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> In the same book, Dmowski blamed the fall of the old Commonwealth on its tradition of tolerance.<ref name=Zamoyski329/> While at first critical of Christianity, Dmowski viewed some sects of Christianity as beneficial to certain nations, through not necessarily Poland. Later in 1927 he revised this earlier view and renounced his criticism of Catholicism, seeing it as an essential part of the Polish identity. Dmowski saw all minorities as weakening agents within the nation that needed to be purged.<ref name=Zamoyski329/><ref name=\"Walicki32\"/> In his 1927 book ''Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, Nar\u00f3d I Pa\u0144stwo'' (''Church, Nation and State''), Dmowski wrote: <blockquote>\"Catholcism is not a supplement to Polishness; its is somehow rooted in its very existence and to an important extent it even forms its existence. The attempt to separate Catholicism from Polishness in Poland, cutting off the nation from religion and Church, would mean destroying the very existence of the nation. The Polish State is a Catholic State. This is not because the vast majority of its inhabitants are Catholics or because of the percentage of Catholics. From our point of view, Poland is Catholic in the full sense of the word, because we are a national state, and our people is a Catholic people\".<ref>Kossert p.97</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the pre-war years, the history of Poland was contested terrain as different ideological forces pulled Polish nationalists in opposite directions, represented by Dmowski and Pi\u0142sudski.<ref name=\"dabrowski\"/> Throughout his career, Dmowski deeply disliked Pi\u0142sudski and much of what he stood for.<ref name=\"Macmillan209\"/> Dmowski came from an impoverished urban background and had little fondness for Poland's traditional elitist social structure.<ref name=Walicki14/><ref name=Macmillan209/> Instead, Dmowski favored a modernizing program and felt Poles should stop looking back nostalgically at the old [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which Dmowski held in deep contempt and should instead embrace the \"modern world\".<ref name=Macmillan209/> In particular, Dmowski despised the old Commonwealth for its multi-national structure and religious tolerance.<ref name=Macmillan209/> He saw the ethnic minorities in Poland (Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians) as a direct threat to the cultural identity, integrity and ethnic cohesion of Poland, directly in competition with the Polish [[petit bourgeoisie]] (small bourgeoisie, aka semi-autonomous peasantry) with which he identified.<ref name=\"Walicki15\"/> Dmowski argued that good citizens should only have one allegiance to the nation, and there is no middle ground.<ref name=\"Walicki1920\"/> In his ideal view of Poland there would be no ethnic minorities; they would either be [[polonized]] or forced to emigrate.<ref name=\"Modras2005\"/> The success of his nationalistic ideas, also adopted and propagated by nationalists in other countries (such as Lithuania and Ukraine) contributed to the disappearance of the tolerant, multiethnic [[Polish-Lithuanian identity]].<ref name=Walicki1920/>\n\nDmowski admired [[Italian Fascism]]. In the summer of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of articles admiring Mussolini and the Italian fascist model, and helped organize the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence.<ref name=\"BlamiresJackson2006\"/><ref name=\"Kunicki2012\"/> Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly imitate the Italian or German models.<ref name=\"Walicki31\"/>\n\n===Antisemitism, anti-Belarusianism, Germanophobia, anti-Lithuanianism, and Ukrainophobia===\n\nDmowski often communicated his belief in an \"international Jewish conspiracy\" aimed against Poland.<ref name=\"Pankowski2010\">{{cite book|author=Rafal Pankowski|title=The Populist Radical Right in Poland: The Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKSLAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=conspiracy+Dmowski|date=February 25, 2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-15097-6|page=26}}</ref> In his essay \"\u017bydzi wobec wojny\" (Jews on the War) written about World War I,<ref name=\"odbudowanie\"/> Dmowski claimed that [[Zionism]] was only a cloak to disguise the Jewish ambition to rule the world.

Endecja's crusade against Jewish cultural values gained mounting intensity in antisemitism of the 1930s, but there were no major pogroms or violent attacks on the Jews in Poland until the German Nazis [[occupied Poland]] and made it [[Final Solution|their mission]] in 1939\u20131944.<ref name=\"radicalization\"/>\n\nIn his 1931 novel ''Dziedzictwo'', Dmowski wrote: \"A Jewish woman will always be a Jew, a Jewish man, a Jew. They have another skin, they smell differently, they carry the evil among the nations\".<ref>Kossert p. 98-99</ref> In his 1938 essay ''Hitleryzm a \u0179ydzi'', Dmowski wrote: <blockquote>\"The tool of the Jews was Wilson, who was concerned that the Allied troops did not cross the German border...Lloyd George stopped regions from becoming part of Poland as they were before: the great majority of our Upper Silesia, Malborg, Sztum and Kwidzyn, and also Gdansk. Lloyd George acted like an agent of the Jews, and nothing gave the impression that Wilson was any less dependent on them. The Jews therefore negotiated an agreement with German Freemasonry, who, in return for help at the conference on the border question, agreed to provide them with a leading position in the German Republic. Eventually, after the peace, the Jews worked for Germany and against Poland in England, American, and even in France, but especially stove so that Germany became less and less a German state and more a Jewish one\".<ref>Kossert p. 98</ref></blockquote> \n\nFor Dmowski, one of Poland's principal problems was that not enough Polish-speaking Catholics were middle-class, while too many ethnic Germans and Jews were. To remedy this perceived problem, he envisioned a policy of confiscating the wealth of Jews and ethnic Germans and redistributing it to Polish Catholics. Dmowski was never able to have this program passed into law by the [[Sejm]], but the National Democrats did frequently organize \"Buy Polish\" boycott campaigns against German and Jewish shops. The first of Dmowski's antisemitic boycotts occurred in 1912 when he attempted to organize a total boycott of Jewish businesses in Warsaw as \"punishment\" for the defeat of some ''Endecja'' candidates in the elections for the ''Duma'', which Dmowski blamed on Warsaw's Jewish population.<ref name=\"Paulsson21\"/> Throughout his life, Dmowski associated Jews with Germans as Poland's principal enemies; the origins of this identification stemmed from Dmowski's deep anger over the forcible \"Germanization\" policies carried out by the German government against its Polish minority during the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], and over the fact that most Jews living in the disputed German/Polish territories had chosen to assimilate into German culture, not Polish culture.<ref name=\"Paulsson41\"/> In Dmowski's opinion Jewish community was not attracted to the cause of Polish independence and was likely to ally itself with potential enemies of Polish state if it would benefit their status.<ref name=Paulsson41/>\n\nDmowski was also a vocal opponent of [[freemasonry]]<ref name=psb223/> as well as of [[feminism]].<ref name=\"Plach2006\"/>\n\n== Recognition ==\n[[File:Pomnik romana dmowskiego.jpg|thumb|Statue of Dmowski in [[Warsaw]]]]\nDmowski's life and work has been subject to numerous academic articles and books. [[Andrzej Walicki]] in 1999 noted that main sources on Dmowski are [[Andrzej Micewski]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1971), [[Roman Wapi\u0144ski]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1988) and [[Krzysztof Kawalec]]'s ''Roman Dmowski'' (1996).<ref name=Walicki12/>\n\nSuppressed during the era of [[communist Poland]], after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Poland, Dmowski's legacy has begun to be more widely recognized.

The political commentator, Janusz Majcherek, wrote in 2005: \"Instead of a modern Conservative Party, such as was able to modernize Britain or Spain, we find in Poland a cheap copy of the ''Endecja'', in which an old-fashioned pre-war nationalism mingles with a pre-Vatican II Catholicism, united in its rejection of modernization and mistrust of the West\".<ref>Kossert p.102</ref> The German historian Andreas Kossert wrote in 2011: \"Dmowski remains the icon of the contemporary Polish political right\".<ref>Kossert p.100.</ref> Both of the Kaczy\u0144ski twins praised Dmowski as an inspiration and Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, when he was mayor of Warsaw, put up the statue to Dmowski.<ref>Kossert p.100.</ref>. \n\nFor his achievement for the independence of Poland and expansion of Polish national consciousness, he was honoured on 8 January 1999 by the Polish Sejm with special legislation. The document honours him also for founding Polish school of [[political realism]] and responsibility, shaping Polish (especially the Western) borders and \"emphasizing the firm connection between Catholicism and Polishness for the survival of the Nation and the rebuilding of the State\".<ref name=Walicki14/><ref name=\"sejm1999\"/>\n\nDmowski was awarded several state awards: the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1923), [[Order of the Star of Romania]] and [[Order of Oranje-Nassau]].
