{"title_page": "Annianus of Alexandria", "text_new": "{{for|the first-century bishop|Anianus of Alexandria}}\n'''Annianus of Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc-gre|italic=yes|Annianos)}} was a monk who flourished in [[Alexandria]] during the [[bishop]]ric of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]] around the beginning of the fifth century. He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria]] for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates.\n\nAs a result, Annianus developed his own [[chronology]] which placed [[Dating Creation|Creation]] on 25 March 5492 BC. This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the [[proleptic calendar|proleptic]] Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four [[Metonic cycle|19-year cycles]] after the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284. The former is known as the Era of Grace in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], whereas the latter is known as the [[Era of Martyrs]]. He was the first [[computus|computist]] to recognize the 532-year cycle of [[Easter]]s in the [[Julian calendar]]. This cycle is often attributed to [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorius]] of [[Aquitaine]] in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.\n\nNone of Annianus's writings have survived. He is principally known from the discussion of his works by [[George Syncellus]] during the 9th century, though lesser fragments appear elsewhere. [[Elijah of Nisibis]] cites him in his 11th-century ''Chronography''.{{sfn|Mosshammer|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA359 359]}}\n\nHowever, Annianus\u2019 Paschal table of 532 years, containing a 532-year Paschal cycle based on a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, has survived.<ref>Neugebauer (1957) 59-63</ref> Its Metonic 19-year lunar cycle was adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who used it in his own (Greek language and Alexandrian calendar) Paschal table of 114 years.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> Shortly before Cyril\u2019s death (AD 444), a beginning was made with a Latin language and Julian calendar Paschal table probably intended for use in the Latin part of Europe; this resulted in a similar Paschal table of 95 years, referred to as \u2018the Paschal table attributed to Cyril\u2019, which covered time interval AD 437-531.<ref>Declercq (2000) 80</ref> A century later this Paschal table was continued by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to a Paschal table covering time interval AD 532-626, two centuries hereafter his Paschal table was extended to [[Bede]]\u2019s Paschal table covering time interval AD 532-1063 and containing a 532-year Paschal cycle.

While recuperating, he either wrote or re-wrote a popular bugle-call for burials, called ''[[Taps]]''. He commanded a division at Fredericksburg, and then became [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]]'s chief of staff, sharing both the credit for improved morale and responsibility for the licentious behaviour that Hooker tolerated in camp. He also became embroiled in Hooker\u2019s political feuds with [[Ambrose Burnside|Burnside]] and [[George Gordon Meade|Meade]]. Wounded at Gettysburg, he served in [[William T. Sherman|Sherman]]\u2019s Atlanta campaign, before retiring from front-line service through illness. He later received the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\nIn [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]\u2019s administration, he was Assistant Treasurer of the United States, abusing that position to [[Black Friday (1869)|manipulate the price of gold]], and being forced to resign. He then resumed his business career. Butterfield\u2019s extensive war archives are displayed at Cold Spring, New York.\n\n==Early life==\nButterfield was born on October 31, 1831 in [[Utica, New York]]. He attended Union Academy and then graduated in 1849, from [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], where he became a member of the [[Sigma Phi Society]]. That same year, his father, [[John Warren Butterfield]], founded the express company of Butterfield, Wasson, and Co., which later became the [[American Express]] Company. After graduating, Daniel studied law but as he was too young to sit the New York bar exam, he toured the country instead. Upon his return to Utica, he joined the Utica Citizen\u2019s Corps as a private.<ref name=union>[http://www.union.edu/library/collections/digital-collections/notables/notables-archive/butterfield-daniel/ \"Daniel Butterfield (1831 - 1901)\", Schaffer Library, Union College]</ref> He was employed in various businesses in New York and the South, including the [[American Express]] Company, which had been co-founded by his father, an owner of the Overland Mail Company, stage-coaches, steamships and telegraph lines.\n\n==Civil War==\n[[File:DanielButterfieldonMount.jpg|thumb|Union General Daniel Butterfield]]\nButterfield went to New York City as superintendent of the eastern division of his father's company. There, he joined the Seventy-First regiment of New York militia as a captain. Shortly after the fall of [[Fort Sumter]], Butterfield joined the Clay Guards of Washington, D.C. as a first sergeant, but subsequently transferred to the [[12th New York Volunteer Infantry]] as a colonel.<ref name=Smithsonian>[http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=420 \"Daniel Butterfield's Medal of Honor\", The Price of Freedom, Smithsonian National Museum of American History]</ref>\n\nHe was commissioned brigadier and major general of the Volunteers and commanded a division of the V Corps.

Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] for the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Fitz John Porter]].  In the [[Seven Days Battles]], at [[Battle of Gaines' Mill|Gaines' Mill]] on June 27, 1862, he was wounded but demonstrated the bravery that was eventually recognized in 1892, with the [[Medal of Honor]].\n \nButterfield continued in brigade command at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and the [[Battle of Antietam]], became division commander and then V Corps commander for the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. His corps was one of those assaulting through the city before facing an assault from Marye's Heights. After the debacles of Fredericksburg and the [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]], Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] replaced [[Ambrose Burnside]] as Army of the Potomac commander and Butterfield became Hooker's [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] in January 1863. Butterfield was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers in March 1863, with a date of rank of November 29, 1862.<ref>Eicher, p. 158.</ref>\n\nHooker and Butterfield developed a close personal and political relationship. To the disgust of many army generals, their headquarters were frequented by women and liquor, being described as a combination of a \"bar and brothel\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Political infighting became rampant in the high command and Butterfield was widely disliked by most of his colleagues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, in the spring of 1863, the two officers managed to turn around the poor morale of the army and greatly improved food, shelter and medical support. During this period Butterfield introduced another custom that remains in the Army today: the use of distinctive hat or shoulder patches to denote the unit to which a soldier belongs, in this case the corps. He was inspired by the division patches used earlier by Maj. Gen. [[Philip Kearny]], but extended those to the full army; Butterfield designed most of the patches himself.\n\nHooker was replaced after the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], just before the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Meade distrusted Butterfield, but retained him as chief of staff. Butterfield was wounded at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, and left active duty to convalesce. Meade removed him as chief of staff on July 14, 1863.<ref>Hyde, pp. 264\u2013265 gives the text of the letter.</ref>  On July 1, 1863, Butterfield was appointed as colonel of the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th United States Infantry]].\n\nAfter Gettysburg, Butterfield actively undermined Meade in cooperation with Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} another crony of Hooker's. Although the battle was a great Union victory, Sickles and Butterfield testified to the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]] that Meade vacillated and planned as early as July 1, to retreat from Gettysburg, thus damaging his reputation. Butterfield's chief evidence for this assertion was the Pipe Creek Circular that Meade had his staff prepare before it became apparent there would be a battle at Gettysburg.<ref>Hyde, p. 275.</ref>\n\nButterfield returned to duty that fall as chief of staff once again for Hooker, now commanding two corps in the [[Army of the Cumberland]] at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. When these two depleted corps (the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI]] and [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII]] Corps) were combined to form the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]], Butterfield was given the 3rd Division, which he led through the first half of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]]. Illness prevented his continuing with Sherman, resulting in Butterfield's assuming light duties at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], followed by recruiting and the command of harbor forces in New York.\n\n===''Taps''===\nWhile the Union Army recuperated at [[Harrison's Landing, Virginia]], from its grueling withdrawal during the Seven Days Battles, Butterfield experimented with bugle calls and is credited with the composition of \"[[Taps]]\". He wrote \"Taps\" to replace the customary firing of three rifle volleys at the end of burials during battle. \"Taps\" also replaced ''Tattoo'', the French bugle call to signal \"lights out\". Butterfield's bugler, Oliver W. Norton of the 83rd Pennsylvania Volunteers, was the first to sound the new call. Within months, \"Taps\" was played by buglers in both the Union and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] armies. This account has been disputed by some military and musical historians, who maintain Butterfield merely revised an earlier call known as the ''[[Scott Tattoo]]'' and did not compose an original work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Medal of Honor===\n[[File:US-MOH-1896.png|thumb|right|75px|Medal of Honor(1896 version)]]\nRank and organization: Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers.

Grant]] appointed Butterfield Assistant [[Treasurer of the United States]], based on a recommendation by [[Abel Corbin]], Grant's brother-in-law. Butterfield agreed to tell Corbin and speculators [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] when the government was planning to sell gold, a market that Fisk and Gould wanted to corner. Butterfield accepted $10,000 from Gould, which Butterfield said was \"to cover expenses\". Butterfield later testified to Congress that it was an [[Unsecured debt|unsecured real estate loan]].<ref>Smith, Grant, pp. 481\u201390.</ref> If Butterfield tipped them off, then Fisk and Gould would sell their gold before the price dropped. The scheme was uncovered by Grant, who sold $4,000,000 of government gold without telling Butterfield resulting in the panic of collapsing gold prices known as [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]], on September 24, 1869.\n\nButterfield resigned from the Treasury Department in October, 1869.<ref>Government Printing Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OU1HAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA332&dq=daniel+butterfield+resigned+treasury&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IUn8UeiFEoTc9QSw64HIBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=daniel%20butterfield%20resigned%20treasury&f=false Index of Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives], 1870, page 332</ref>  He then became active in business and banking, including an executive position with American Express.<ref>Easton Free Press, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5B9YAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XEUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4110,5664971&dq=daniel+butterfield+american+express&hl=en Butterfield is Dead], July 18, 1901</ref>  He was also active in Union College's alumni association and several veterans organizations, including the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref>Julia Lorrilard Butterfield, editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nAj4dP6tQU8C&pg=PA46&dq=daniel+butterfield+american+express&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-Un8Ub22AYW09QS3sIHQCA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=daniel%20butterfield%20american%20express&f=false ''A Biographical Memorial of General Daniel Butterfield''], 1904, pages 234-235</ref>\n\nOn September 21, 1886, Butterfield married Mrs. Julia Lorrilard Safford James of New York in a ceremony in [[London]]. The Butterfields built a summer residence, ''Cragside'', across the Hudson River from West Point in [[Cold Spring, New York]],{{sfn|Butterfield, p. 2}} where Daniel Butterfield died on July 17, 1901. He was buried with an ornate monument in the [[West Point Cemetery]] at the [[United States Military Academy]], although he had not attended that institution.

According to Reel, \"The historical importance of the collection is unquestionable as a comprehensive archive of a major figure of the American Civil War and contains documents and letters, telegrams from 1861-64 that are irreplaceable and significant in content. . .

Grant]] appointed Butterfield Assistant [[Treasurer of the United States]], based on a recommendation by [[Abel Corbin]], Grant's brother-in-law. Butterfield agreed to tell Corbin and speculators [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] when the government was planning to sell gold, a market that Fisk and Gould wanted to corner. Butterfield accepted $10,000 from Gould, which Butterfield said was \"to cover expenses\". Butterfield later testified to Congress that it was an [[Unsecured debt|unsecured real estate loan]].<ref>Smith, Grant, pp. 481\u201390.</ref> If Butterfield tipped them off, then Fisk and Gould would sell their gold before the price dropped. The scheme was uncovered by Grant, who sold $4,000,000 of government gold without telling Butterfield resulting in the panic of collapsing gold prices known as [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]], on September 24, 1869.\n\nButterfield resigned from the Treasury Department in October, 1869.<ref>Government Printing Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OU1HAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA332&dq=daniel+butterfield+resigned+treasury&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IUn8UeiFEoTc9QSw64HIBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=daniel%20butterfield%20resigned%20treasury&f=false Index of Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives], 1870, page 332</ref>  He then became active in business and banking, including an executive position with American Express.<ref>Easton Free Press, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5B9YAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XEUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4110,5664971&dq=daniel+butterfield+american+express&hl=en Butterfield is Dead], July 18, 1901</ref>  He was also active in Union College's alumni association and several veterans organizations, including the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref>Julia Lorrilard Butterfield, editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nAj4dP6tQU8C&pg=PA46&dq=daniel+butterfield+american+express&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-Un8Ub22AYW09QS3sIHQCA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=daniel%20butterfield%20american%20express&f=false ''A Biographical Memorial of General Daniel Butterfield''], 1904, pages 234-235</ref>\n\nOn September 21, 1886, Butterfield married Mrs. Julia Lorrilard Safford James of New York in a ceremony in [[London]].

According to Reel, \"The historical importance of the collection is unquestionable as a comprehensive archive of a major figure of the American Civil War and contains documents and letters, telegrams from 1861-64 that are irreplaceable and significant in content. . .

After the outlets published corrections, OpIndia continued to allege that the errors were intentional. The rhetoric employed by OpIndia is similar to the strategies used by European [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] publications that aim to engender distrust in the mainstream media.<ref name=\"JIIC\" />\n# '''\"[[Online shaming|Shaming]]\" journalists:''' OpIndia attacked the \"professional [[integrity]]\" of specific mainstream media journalists that the website suspected of being opposed to the majority [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), including journalists from ''[[The Wire (India)|The Wire]]'', ''[[The Indian Express]]'', NDTV, and ''[[The Quint]]''. OpIndia accused these journalists of [[sexual harassment]], [[plagiarism]], [[financial misconduct]], \"malicious editing\", and other forms of \"unethical behavior\".

OpIndia's method of attacking journalists resembles the practices used by American right-wing publications.<ref name=\"JIIC\" />\n# '''Alleging partisanship:''' OpIndia alleged the existence of a \"news media [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]\" in which mainstream media outlets were biased against the majority BJP and favorable of the minority [[Indian National Congress]] (INC), which the website considered part of the \"[[The Establishment|establishment]]\". OpIndia claimed that the media produced too little coverage of the INC's use of [[Cambridge Analytica]], while providing too much coverage of the BJP's handling of the [[Rafale deal controversy]]. English-language outlets were the primary targets of OpIndia's criticism.<ref name=\"JIIC\" />\n# '''Amplifying criticism:''' OpIndia regularly featured stories in which celebrities and public officials criticised mainstream media outlets, and reports in which the outlets apologised to critics. In these stories, OpIndia accused journalists of various faults, including \"insensitivity and irresponsibility\", \"misinformation\", publishing sensitive information, and compromising \"national security\". In one story, OpIndia covered the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]'s criticism of journalist [[Nidhi Razdan]], then de-emphasised the Minister's correction after the situation was revealed to be a \"misunderstanding\".<ref name=\"JIIC\" />\n# '''Alleging bias against India and [[Hindu]]s:''' OpIndia accused Indian publications of having a [[Liberalism in India|liberal]] [[media bias]] and of publishing stories that were \"anti-India\", particularly regarding [[India\u2013Pakistan relations]].

It is in the [[W3C]]'s candidate recommendation (CR) stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/|title=CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1|website=www.w3.org|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref> The flex layout allows [[Responsive web design|responsive]] elements within a container to be automatically arranged  depending upon screen size (or device).\n{{CSS}}\n\n==Concepts==\nMost web pages are written in a combination of [[HTML]] (Hypertext Markup Language) and [[CSS]] (Cascading Style Sheets).  In short, HTML specifies the ''content and logical structure of the page'', while the CSS specifies ''how it looks'': its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling.  \n\nCSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages.\n\nOne of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in size\u2014either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. Indeed, not only can flex directional flow be specified, at the style level, as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards; individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/|title=CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1|website=dev.w3.org|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 2000s the intensive use of the Web by mobile agents motivated \"liquid layouts\" and [[Responsive_web_design#History|responsive elements]] for the growing variety of screen sizes.<ref>https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-cssqueries/index.html</ref> \nIn the 2010s, the intensive use of popular JavaScript layout frameworks, such as [[Bootstrap (front-end framework)|Bootstrap]], inspired CSS flex-box and grid layout  specifications.<ref>https://github.com/kvdmolen/grid-flexbox-sass</ref> <ref>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/css3-flexible-box-layout-explained/</ref>\n\nCSS 3 modules included solutions akin to this, like flexbox <ref>https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp</ref> and [[CSS grid layout|grid]]<ref>https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp</ref>.\n\n==Terminology==\nFollowing are a few terms associated with the flex layout model\n\n===Flex container===\n:Parent element that holds all flex items. Using the CSS display property, the container can be defined as either flex or inline-flex.\n\n===Flex item===\n:Any direct child element held within the flex container is considered a flex item. Any text within the container element is wrapped in an unknown flex item.\n\n===Axes===\n:Each flex box contains two axes: the main and cross axes. The '''main axis''' is the axis on which the items align with each other. The '''cross axis''' is perpendicular to the main axis.\n'''Flex-direction'''\n:Establishes main axis. Possible arguments: row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse.\n'''Justify-content'''\n:Determines how content gets placed on the main axis on the current line. Optional arguments: left, right, center, space-between, space-around.\n'''Align-items'''\n:Determines the default for how flex items get placed on the cross axis on each line.\n\n'''Align-content'''\n:Determines the default for how cross axis lines are aligned.\n\n'''Align-self'''\n:Determines how a single item is placed along the cross axis. This overrides any defaults set by align-items.\n\n===Directions===\n:The '''main-start/main-end''' sides determine where to start placing flex items within the flex container, starting from the main-start end and going to the main-end end. The '''cross-start/cross-end''' sides determine where flex lines get filled with flex items from cross-start to cross-end.\n'''Order'''\n:Places elements in groups and determines which order they are to be placed in within the container.\n'''Flex-flow'''\n:Shorthands flex-direction and flex-wrap to place the flex content.\n\n===Lines===\n:Flex items can either be placed on a singular line or on multiple lines as defined by the flex-wrap property, which controls both the direction of the cross axis and how lines stack within the container.\n\n===Dimensions===\n:'''Main size''' and '''cross size''' are essentially the height and width of the flex container, each dealing with the main and cross axes respectively.\n\n==Designate a flex box==\nDesignating an element as a flex element is relatively easy.

It is in the [[W3C]]'s candidate recommendation (CR) stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/|title=CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1|website=www.w3.org|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref> The flex layout allows [[Responsive web design|responsive]] elements within a container to be automatically arranged  depending upon screen size (or device).\n{{CSS}}\n\n==Concepts==\nMost web pages are written in a combination of [[HTML]] (Hypertext Markup Language) and [[CSS]] (Cascading Style Sheets).  In short, HTML specifies the ''content and logical structure of the page'', while the CSS specifies ''how it looks'': its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling.  \n\nCSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages.\n\nOne of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in size\u2014either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. Indeed, not only can flex directional flow be specified, at the style level, as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards; individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/|title=CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1|website=dev.w3.org|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 2000s the intensive use of the Web by mobile agents motivated \"liquid layouts\" and [[Responsive_web_design#History|responsive elements]] for the growing variety of screen sizes.<ref>https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-cssqueries/index.html</ref> \nIn the 2010s, the intensive use of popular JavaScript layout frameworks, such as [[Bootstrap (front-end framework)|Bootstrap]], inspired CSS flex-box and grid layout  specifications.<ref>https://github.com/kvdmolen/grid-flexbox-sass</ref> <ref>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/css3-flexible-box-layout-explained/</ref>\n\nCSS 3 modules included solutions akin to this, like flexbox <ref>https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp</ref> and [[CSS grid layout|grid]]<ref>https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp</ref>.\n\n==Terminology==\nFollowing are a few terms associated with the flex layout model\n\n===Flex container===\n:Parent element that holds all flex items. Using the CSS display property, the container can be defined as either flex or inline-flex.\n\n===Flex item===\n:Any direct child element held within the flex container is considered a flex item. Any text within the container element is wrapped in an unknown flex item.\n\n===Axes===\n:Each flex box contains two axes: the main and cross axes. The '''main axis''' is the axis on which the items align with each other. The '''cross axis''' is perpendicular to the main axis.\n'''Flex-direction'''\n:Establishes main axis. Possible arguments: row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse.\n'''Justify-content'''\n:Determines how content gets placed on the main axis on the current line. Optional arguments: left, right, center, space-between, space-around.\n'''Align-items'''\n:Determines the default for how flex items get placed on the cross axis on each line.\n\n'''Align-content'''\n:Determines the default for how cross axis lines are aligned.\n\n'''Align-self'''\n:Determines how a single item is placed along the cross axis. This overrides any defaults set by align-items.\n\n===Directions===\n:The '''main-start/main-end''' sides determine where to start placing flex items within the flex container, starting from the main-start end and going to the main-end end. The '''cross-start/cross-end''' sides determine where flex lines get filled with flex items from cross-start to cross-end.\n'''Order'''\n:Places elements in groups and determines which order they are to be placed in within the container.\n'''Flex-flow'''\n:Shorthands flex-direction and flex-wrap to place the flex content.\n\n===Lines===\n:Flex items can either be placed on a singular line or on multiple lines as defined by the flex-wrap property, which controls both the direction of the cross axis and how lines stack within the container.\n\n===Dimensions===\n:'''Main size''' and '''cross size''' are essentially the height and width of the flex container, each dealing with the main and cross axes respectively.\n\n==Designate a flex box==\nDesignating an element as a flex element is relatively easy. All that is necessary is to set the display property to either flex or inline-flex as follows:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: flex;</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOr:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: inline-flex;</syntaxhighlight>\nBy setting the display to one of the two values above, an element becomes a flex container and its children flex items. Setting the display to flex makes the container a [[HTML_element#Block_elements|block-level element]], while setting the display to inline-flex makes the container an [[HTML_element#Inline_elements|inline-level element]].<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes Using CSS flexible boxes \u2013 Web developer guide | MDN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Align to center ==\nOne of flexbox's advantages is the ability to easily align items within the container to the center of a page, both vertically and horizontally.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\">\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, ''asb\u0101b'' is by nature an [[exegesis|exegetical]] rather than a [[historiography|historiographical]] genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. [[Nasa'i]] and other traditionists have related a tradition from [[Ibn 'Abbas]], and Hakim hold it as authentic, that Nadr bin al-Harith Kaladah had said \"O God, if it is really the Truth sent dawn by You, then rain down stones on us from the heavens, or send down any other painful torment on us.\" (AI-Anfal: 32).<ref name=\"englishtafsir.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Asbab al-Nuzul By: Ali ibn Ahmad al-Wahidi TRANSLATED BY Mokrane Guezzou Edited and with a brief Introduction by [[Yousef Meri]]</ref>\nThe person here meant is generally supposed to have been al Nud\u00e1r Ibn al H\u00e1rith, who said, \u2018O God, if what Muhammad preaches be the truth from thee, rain down upon us a shower of stones, or send some dreadful judgment to punish us.\u2019 Others, however, think it was Ab\u00fa Jahl, who challenged Muhammad to cause a fragment of heaven to fall on them.\"\u2014Sale,<ref>Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896)</ref> [[Baidawi]].<ref>The Secrets of Revelation and The Secrets of Interpretation (Asrar ut-tanzil wa Asrar ut-ta'wil)</ref>\n\n[[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] an influential [[Islamic]] [[Sufi]] religious figure, teacher, preacher and writer however holds the opinion that the demand for torment referred in the 1st ayah of this surah was made by Prophet [[Muhammad]] himself for the disbelievers due to the increasing [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans]]. And for example Dr.[[Israr Ahmed]] cites the demand of torment by prophet [[Noah in Islam|N\u016b\u1e25]] against his people in the [[Nuh (sura)|next surah]] which is also the pair of surah Al-Ma'arij.

This battle is greater and longer lasting than the wars the Muslims later had to fight against their many enemies.\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/InTheShadeOfTheQuranSayyidQutb ''Fi Dhilal al-Quran'']. Beirut: Dar al-Shurruq (1981)</ref> He further elaborates:\n\n<blockquote>The major issue the surah focuses on is that of the hereafter and peoples requital for what they do during their lives on earth, particularly the punishment suffered by the unbelievers. In order to establish the truth of the hereafter, the surah speaks of how the human soul reacts to situations of hardship and comfort. Such reactions differ greatly between a believer and one who is devoid of faith. The surah also provides an outline of the believers' main features, their feelings and behaviour, and it states how they deserve to be honoured. It also shows that the unbelievers are held in disregard by God, and gives a picture of the humiliation prepared for them. It is a humiliation the arrogant thoroughly deserve. Furthermore, the surah establishes the fact that values, standards and scales applied by God are different from those which human beings uphold. \"\n\u2014[[Sayid Qutb]], ''[[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]]''\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] (b. 1951), a well-known [[Pakistani]] [[Muslim theology|Muslim theologian]], Quran scholar and exegete, and educationist, classifies surah Al-Ma'arij as a pair with the [[Al-Haaqqa|last one]] with regard to the subject discussed in them.

Just like the above-mentioned [[exegetes]],  Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik states his understanding of the Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance in surah Al-Ma'arij as:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The whole Surah is meant to answer this question saying: \"Resurrection, which they desire to be hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when it comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits. At that time they will even be prepared to give away their wives and children and their nearest kinfolks in ransom to escape the punishment, but they will not be able to escape it. On that Day, the destinies of mankind will be decided strictly on the basis of their belief and their conduct. Those who turn away from the Truth in this world, amass wealth and withhold it from the needy, will be doomed to hell; and those who fear the punishment of Allah, believe in the Hereafter, establish Salah (keep up the prayers), discharge the rights of the needy out of their wealth, strictly avoid immoral and wicked deeds, practise honesty in all their dealings, fulfill their pledges and trust and bear true witness, will have a place of honor in paradise\" - Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik<ref>Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik (translator), Al-Qur'an, the Guidance for Mankind - English with Arabic Text (Hardcover) {{ISBN|0-911119-80-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Contents==\nThe Quranic text has been divided into separate [[Ruku#Quranic subdivision|ruku]]s in terms of thematically related [[Ayah]].

The contents of the 1st Ruku<ref>{{Cite quran|70|1|e=35|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> states that the [[Last Judgment|day of judgement]] will be equal to fifty thousand years and [[kafir|disbelievers]] will wish to save themselves from the punishment at the expense of their children, wives, brothers and relatives, but it will not happen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> 2nd Ruku<ref>{{Cite quran|70|36|e=44|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> starts from ayah 36 and continues uptill the end of the surah and it states that the [[Paradise]] is not for the disbelievers and Disbelievers will have downcast eyes and countenances distorted with shame.<ref>http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/theme/70</ref>\n\nAnother noticeable fact about this surah needs to be addressed that passage 70:29 to 70:32<ref>{{Cite quran|70|29|e=32|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> is completely identical to the passage Al-Mu'minoon 23:5 to 23:8.<ref>{{Cite quran|23|5|e=8|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> About this presence of repetition<ref name=blomm>\"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention.

According to Stefan Wild the Quran demonstrates this meta-textuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages when the Quran refers to itself as revelation (''tanzil''), remembrance (''dhikr''), news (''naba'''), criterion (''furqan'') in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, \"And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?\" (21:50), or in the frequent appearance of the 'Say' tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g. \"Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance' \", \"Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?' \"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan chapters.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Wild|editor-first=Stefan |title=Self-referentiality in the Qur'an |year=2006 |publisher=Harrassowitz |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=3447053836}}</ref><ref>[[Quran#Literary style]]</ref>\n\n[[Abul A'la Maududi]] (September 25, 1903 \u2013 September 22, 1979) was a [[journalist]], [[theology|theologian]], [[Islamic revival|Muslim revivalist]] leader and [[political philosopher]], and a 20th-century [[Islamist]] thinker in [[India]], and later [[Pakistan]].<ref name = \"Zebiri\">Zebiri, Kate.

They think it is far off, but We see it as near at hand.\"\n\nThen it is said:\"Resurrection, which they desire to be hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when it comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits. At that time they will even be prepared to give away their wives and children and their nearest kinsfolk in ransom to escape the punishment, but they will not be able to escape it.\n\nThen the people have been warned to the effect; \"On that Day the destinies of men will be decided strictly on the basis of their belief and their conduct. Those who turn away from the Truth in the world and amass wealth and withhold it from the needy, will be doomed to Hell; and those who fear the punishment of God here, believe in the Hereafter, keep up the Prayer, discharge the rights of the needy out of their wealth, strictly avoid immoral and wicked deeds, practice honesty in all their dealings, fulfill their pledges and trust and bear true witness, will have a place of honor in Paradise\"\n\nIn conclusion, the disbelievers of [[Makkah]] who rushed in upon the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) from every side as soon as they saw him, in order to make fun of him, have been warned to the effect: \"If you do not believe, [[Allah]] will replace you by other people who will be better than you\", and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been consoled, so as to say: \"Do not take to heart their mockery and jesting; leave them to indulge in their idle talk and foolish conduct if they are bent upon experiencing the disgrace and humiliation of the Resurrection; they will themselves see their evil end.\"'\u2014[[Abul A'la Maududi]], ''[[Tafhim-ul-Quran]]''<ref>[http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/quran/maududi/mau91.html ''Tafhim al-Qur'an''].

Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, ''asb\u0101b'' is by nature an [[exegesis|exegetical]] rather than a [[historiography|historiographical]] genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. [[Nasa'i]] and other traditionists have related a tradition from [[Ibn 'Abbas]], and Hakim hold it as authentic, that Nadr bin al-Harith Kaladah had said \"O God, if it is really the Truth sent dawn by You, then rain down stones on us from the heavens, or send down any other painful torment on us.\" (AI-Anfal: 32).<ref name=\"englishtafsir.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Asbab al-Nuzul By: Ali ibn Ahmad al-Wahidi TRANSLATED BY Mokrane Guezzou Edited and with a brief Introduction by [[Yousef Meri]]</ref>\nThe person here meant is generally supposed to have been al Nud\u00e1r Ibn al H\u00e1rith, who said, \u2018O God, if what Muhammad preaches be the truth from thee, rain down upon us a shower of stones, or send some dreadful judgment to punish us.\u2019 Others, however, think it was Ab\u00fa Jahl, who challenged Muhammad to cause a fragment of heaven to fall on them.\"\u2014Sale,<ref>Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896)</ref> [[Baidawi]].<ref>The Secrets of Revelation and The Secrets of Interpretation (Asrar ut-tanzil wa Asrar ut-ta'wil)</ref>\n\n[[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] an influential [[Islamic]] [[Sufi]] religious figure, teacher, preacher and writer however holds the opinion that the demand for torment referred in the 1st ayah of this surah was made by Prophet [[Muhammad]] himself for the disbelievers due to the increasing [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans]]. And for example Dr.[[Israr Ahmed]] cites the demand of torment by prophet [[Noah in Islam|N\u016b\u1e25]] against his people in the [[Nuh (sura)|next surah]] which is also the pair of surah Al-Ma'arij.

This battle is greater and longer lasting than the wars the Muslims later had to fight against their many enemies.\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/InTheShadeOfTheQuranSayyidQutb ''Fi Dhilal al-Quran'']. Beirut: Dar al-Shurruq (1981)</ref> He further elaborates:\n\n<blockquote>The major issue the surah focuses on is that of the hereafter and peoples requital for what they do during their lives on earth, particularly the punishment suffered by the unbelievers. In order to establish the truth of the hereafter, the surah speaks of how the human soul reacts to situations of hardship and comfort. Such reactions differ greatly between a believer and one who is devoid of faith. The surah also provides an outline of the believers' main features, their feelings and behaviour, and it states how they deserve to be honoured. It also shows that the unbelievers are held in disregard by God, and gives a picture of the humiliation prepared for them. It is a humiliation the arrogant thoroughly deserve. Furthermore, the surah establishes the fact that values, standards and scales applied by God are different from those which human beings uphold. \"\n\u2014[[Sayid Qutb]], ''[[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]]''\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] (b. 1951), a well-known [[Pakistani]] [[Muslim theology|Muslim theologian]], Quran scholar and exegete, and educationist, classifies surah Al-Ma'arij as a pair with the [[Al-Haaqqa|last one]] with regard to the subject discussed in them.

Just like the above-mentioned [[exegetes]],  Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik states his understanding of the Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance in surah Al-Ma'arij as:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The whole Surah is meant to answer this question saying: \"Resurrection, which they desire to be hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when it comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits.

On that Day, the destinies of mankind will be decided strictly on the basis of their belief and their conduct. Those who turn away from the Truth in this world, amass wealth and withhold it from the needy, will be doomed to hell; and those who fear the punishment of Allah, believe in the Hereafter, establish Salah (keep up the prayers), discharge the rights of the needy out of their wealth, strictly avoid immoral and wicked deeds, practise honesty in all their dealings, fulfill their pledges and trust and bear true witness, will have a place of honor in paradise\" - Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik<ref>Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik (translator), Al-Qur'an, the Guidance for Mankind - English with Arabic Text (Hardcover) {{ISBN|0-911119-80-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Contents==\nThe Quranic text has been divided into separate [[Ruku#Quranic subdivision|ruku]]s in terms of thematically related [[Ayah]]. This surah contains 2 [[ruku]]s. The contents of the 1st Ruku<ref>{{Cite quran|70|1|e=35|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> states that the [[Last Judgment|day of judgement]] will be equal to fifty thousand years and [[kafir|disbelievers]] will wish to save themselves from the punishment at the expense of their children, wives, brothers and relatives, but it will not happen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> 2nd Ruku<ref>{{Cite quran|70|36|e=44|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> starts from ayah 36 and continues uptill the end of the surah and it states that the [[Paradise]] is not for the disbelievers and Disbelievers will have downcast eyes and countenances distorted with shame.<ref>http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/theme/70</ref>\n\nAnother noticeable fact about this surah needs to be addressed that passage 70:29 to 70:32<ref>{{Cite quran|70|29|e=32|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> is completely identical to the passage Al-Mu'minoon 23:5 to 23:8.<ref>{{Cite quran|23|5|e=8|s=ns|tn=y}}</ref> About this presence of repetition<ref name=blomm>\"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention.

Brown]], acknowledges Brown's observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression \u2013 its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells's phrase \u2013 is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated.<ref name = ApproachQuran>Michael Sells, ''Approaching the Qur'an'' (White Cloud Press, 1999)</ref><ref>Norman O. Brown, \"The Apocalypse of Islam.\" ''Social Text'' 3:8 (1983\u20131984)</ref> Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device.\n\nA text is self-referential when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself. According to Stefan Wild the Quran demonstrates this meta-textuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages when the Quran refers to itself as revelation (''tanzil''), remembrance (''dhikr''), news (''naba'''), criterion (''furqan'') in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, \"And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?\" (21:50), or in the frequent appearance of the 'Say' tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g. \"Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance' \", \"Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?' \"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan chapters.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Wild|editor-first=Stefan |title=Self-referentiality in the Qur'an |year=2006 |publisher=Harrassowitz |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=3447053836}}</ref><ref>[[Quran#Literary style]]</ref>\n\n[[Abul A'la Maududi]] (September 25, 1903 \u2013 September 22, 1979) was a [[journalist]], [[theology|theologian]], [[Islamic revival|Muslim revivalist]] leader and [[political philosopher]], and a 20th-century [[Islamist]] thinker in [[India]], and later [[Pakistan]].<ref name = \"Zebiri\">Zebiri, Kate.
