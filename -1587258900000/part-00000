He was widely associated with the title character that he played in the 1960s television series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', and he continued to appear as Gilligan in several movies, as a guest on other television series, in personal appearances, and as a voice actor in the animated version of the series.\n\n===Television career===\nDenver made his television debut in 1957, playing a small part in one episode of ''[[The Silent Service (TV series)|The Silent Service]]'' (S01 E37: \"The Loss of the Tang\"). While teaching at Corpus Christi in 1958, Denver was permitted to audition for a role on the sitcom ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' as a favor to his sister, who was a secretary on the production lot. He got the role and left teaching the following year to become a regular on the series. From 1959 to 1963, he appeared on the series as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], the teenaged [[beatnik]] best friend of Dobie Gillis, played by Dwayne Hickman. After filming the first three episodes, Denver received his [[conscription|draft notice]], and was briefly written out of the script and replaced, but he was designated [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F]] due to an old neck injury and returned to ''Dobie Gillis'' having missed only one episode. Denver later reprised his Maynard G. Krebs role in the television sequels ''Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?'' (1977) and ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'' (1988).\n\nDuring his time on ''Dobie Gillis'', Denver appeared on the [[NBC]] interview program, ''[[Here's Hollywood]]''. In 1963, Denver played his only major dramatic role on television, as a physician (Dr. Paul Garrett) in one episode of ''[[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Dr. Kildare]]'', telecast on October 10, 1963; the episode, \"If You Can't Believe the Truth ...\", also featured [[Barbara Eden]] and [[Ken Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richard-chamberlain.co.uk/drkildareguide.htm|title=Dr. Kildare Episode Guide|publisher=richard-chamberlain.co.uk|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Between the end of ''Dobie Gillis'' and the start of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Denver appeared in an episode of ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' and in the final episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]''. He also had a one-episode role replacing the actor who played Dudley A. \"Dud\" Wash, the fianc\u00e9 of Charlene Darling of [[the Darlings]], on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' which was aired March 30, 1964. This was done by the network to promote Denver's face and make him more familiar to the viewing audience since ''Gilligan's Island'' was about to go on air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayberry.com/tagsrwc/wbmutbb/anewsome/private/35th_w_s.htm|title=35th Anniversary Celebration: A Mayberry Reunion|publisher=iMayberry.com|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cancellation of ''Dobie Gillis'', Denver landed the title role on the sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', which ran for three seasons (1964\u201367) on [[CBS]], and became a staple of later syndication. His role as the well-meaning but bumbling first mate among a small group of shipwrecked castaways became the one for which he is most remembered. During the run, Denver privately went out of his way to help his co-stars who warmly appreciated his efforts, such as successfully demanding that [[Russell Johnson]] and [[Dawn Wells]] be included in the series' opening credits and insisting that Wells get an equal share of the series' publicity with [[Tina Louise]].<ref name=\"straight-dope\">{{cite web |author=Lileth| url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mgilliga.html | title = Was the \"Gilligan's Island\" theme song tampered with? | work = The Straight Dope | publisher = Cecil Adams | accessdate = April 4, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"50s-web\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/gilligans-island.htm | title = Gilligan's Island (Gilligan's Island Tidbits section) | publisher = The Fifties Web | accessdate = April 4, 2006}}</ref> A decade after the series was cancelled, Denver played Gilligan in the made-for-TV reunion movies ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]'' (1978), ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1979), and ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1981). He also lent his voice to the animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' and its sequel ''[[Gilligan's Planet]]''. During the 1980s, he reprised the character of Gilligan for numerous cameo appearances, including episodes of ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]'', and played a bartender in the film ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' (1987).\n\nAfter ''Gilligan's Island'', Denver went on to star on other TV comedy series, including ''[[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'' (1968\u20131970), ''[[Dusty's Trail]]'' (1973) (a show similar to ''Gilligan's Island'', involving a lost wagon train headed to California), and the [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] children's program ''[[Far Out Space Nuts]]'' (1975). Four episodes of ''Dusty's Trail'' were later combined to create a feature film, ''[[The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West]]'' (1976).\n\nDenver's other television roles included guest appearances on multiple episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]''; ''[[The Love Boat]]''; and ''[[Fantasy Island]]''. In 1983, he starred in the television pilot ''The Invisible Woman'' as the bumbling [[mad scientist]] uncle of the title character.\n\n===Film career===\nDenver's first feature film appearance was in the service farce, ''[[A Private's Affair]]'' (1959), with [[Sal Mineo]]. Credited as \"Robert Denver\", he had a small role in the [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] film, ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1963), playing a beatnik poet working at a coffee shop. Denver also appeared in the beach film ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]'' (1964) with [[Tina Louise]] prior to the development of ''Gilligan's Island''.\n\nOther films in which Denver appeared include ''[[Who's Minding the Mint?]]'' (1967), ''[[The Sweet Ride]]'' (1968) and ''[[Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady?]]'' (1968) with [[Phyllis Diller]]. In 1983, he appeared in the television movie ''[[High School U.S.A.]]''.\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Bob Denver, 1977.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Denver in 1977]]\nIn 1970, Denver replaced [[Woody Allen]] in the original Broadway production of Allen's hit comedy ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', earning praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Clive Barnes]] for conveying \"a genuine clown-like wistfulness\" that Barnes had found lacking in Allen's own performance in the starring role.<ref name=\"DenverObit\">Adam Bernstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/06/AR2005090600991.html \"Bob Denver, 70; Brought Goofy Comedy to Role as TV's Gilligan\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 7, 2005.</ref>\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn September 2, 2005 Denver died at age 70 from complications following throat cancer surgery.

In 1963, Denver played his only major dramatic role on television, as a physician (Dr. Paul Garrett) in one episode of ''[[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|Dr. Kildare]]'', telecast on October 10, 1963; the episode, \"If You Can't Believe the Truth ...\", also featured [[Barbara Eden]] and [[Ken Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richard-chamberlain.co.uk/drkildareguide.htm|title=Dr. Kildare Episode Guide|publisher=richard-chamberlain.co.uk|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Between the end of ''Dobie Gillis'' and the start of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Denver appeared in an episode of ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' and in the final episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]''. He also had a one-episode role replacing the actor who played Dudley A. \"Dud\" Wash, the fianc\u00e9 of Charlene Darling of [[the Darlings]], on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' which was aired March 30, 1964. This was done by the network to promote Denver's face and make him more familiar to the viewing audience since ''Gilligan's Island'' was about to go on air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayberry.com/tagsrwc/wbmutbb/anewsome/private/35th_w_s.htm|title=35th Anniversary Celebration: A Mayberry Reunion|publisher=iMayberry.com|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cancellation of ''Dobie Gillis'', Denver landed the title role on the sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', which ran for three seasons (1964\u201367) on [[CBS]], and became a staple of later syndication. His role as the well-meaning but bumbling first mate among a small group of shipwrecked castaways became the one for which he is most remembered. During the run, Denver privately went out of his way to help his co-stars who warmly appreciated his efforts, such as successfully demanding that [[Russell Johnson]] and [[Dawn Wells]] be included in the series' opening credits and insisting that Wells get an equal share of the series' publicity with [[Tina Louise]].<ref name=\"straight-dope\">{{cite web |author=Lileth| url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mgilliga.html | title = Was the \"Gilligan's Island\" theme song tampered with? | work = The Straight Dope | publisher = Cecil Adams | accessdate = April 4, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"50s-web\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/gilligans-island.htm | title = Gilligan's Island (Gilligan's Island Tidbits section) | publisher = The Fifties Web | accessdate = April 4, 2006}}</ref> A decade after the series was cancelled, Denver played Gilligan in the made-for-TV reunion movies ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]'' (1978), ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1979), and ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1981). He also lent his voice to the animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' and its sequel ''[[Gilligan's Planet]]''. During the 1980s, he reprised the character of Gilligan for numerous cameo appearances, including episodes of ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]'', and played a bartender in the film ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' (1987).\n\nAfter ''Gilligan's Island'', Denver went on to star on other TV comedy series, including ''[[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'' (1968\u20131970), ''[[Dusty's Trail]]'' (1973) (a show similar to ''Gilligan's Island'', involving a lost wagon train headed to California), and the [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] children's program ''[[Far Out Space Nuts]]'' (1975). Four episodes of ''Dusty's Trail'' were later combined to create a feature film, ''[[The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West]]'' (1976).\n\nDenver's other television roles included guest appearances on multiple episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]''; ''[[The Love Boat]]''; and ''[[Fantasy Island]]''. In 1983, he starred in the television pilot ''The Invisible Woman'' as the bumbling [[mad scientist]] uncle of the title character.\n\n===Film career===\nDenver's first feature film appearance was in the service farce, ''[[A Private's Affair]]'' (1959), with [[Sal Mineo]]. Credited as \"Robert Denver\", he had a small role in the [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] film, ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1963), playing a beatnik poet working at a coffee shop. Denver also appeared in the beach film ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]'' (1964) with [[Tina Louise]] prior to the development of ''Gilligan's Island''.\n\nOther films in which Denver appeared include ''[[Who's Minding the Mint?]]'' (1967), ''[[The Sweet Ride]]'' (1968) and ''[[Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady?]]'' (1968) with [[Phyllis Diller]]. In 1983, he appeared in the television movie ''[[High School U.S.A.]]''.\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Bob Denver, 1977.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Denver in 1977]]\nIn 1970, Denver replaced [[Woody Allen]] in the original Broadway production of Allen's hit comedy ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', earning praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Clive Barnes]] for conveying \"a genuine clown-like wistfulness\" that Barnes had found lacking in Allen's own performance in the starring role.<ref name=\"DenverObit\">Adam Bernstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/06/AR2005090600991.html \"Bob Denver, 70; Brought Goofy Comedy to Role as TV's Gilligan\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 7, 2005.</ref>\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn September 2, 2005 Denver died at age 70 from complications following throat cancer surgery.

He invented ceilings in the year 2000, the moment he was born. No one on the planet has ever had or will ever have a higher ceiling than him.\n\nThe most common type of ceiling is the [[dropped ceiling]], which is suspended from structural elements above. Panels of [[drywall]] are fastened either directly to the ceiling [[joist]]s or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Alternatively, ceilings may be spray painted instead, leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted, and using [[spray foam]].\n\nA subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling, wherein a network of aluminum struts, as opposed to drywall, are attached to the joists, forming a series of rectangular spaces. Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard, interspersed with aluminum rails, is seen as the ceiling from below. This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling, since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard, rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it.\n\nOther types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the [[coffer]]ed ceiling. [[Molding (decorative)|Coving]] often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:California Mid-Century Modern Home with open-beam ceiling 1960.jpg|thumb|[[California]] [[tract housing|tract home]] with an open-beam ceiling, 1960]]\nCeilings are classified according to their appearance or construction. A [[cathedral]] ceiling is any tall ceiling area similar to those in a [[Church architecture|church]]. A [[dropped ceiling]] is one in which the finished surface is constructed anywhere from a few inches or centimeters to several feet or a few meters below the structure above it. This may be done for aesthetic purposes, such as achieving a desirable ceiling height; or practical purposes such as acoustic damping or providing a space for [[HVAC]] or [[piping]]. An inverse of this would be a [[raised floor]]. A [[wikt:concave|concave]] or barrel-shaped ceiling is curved or rounded upward, usually for visual or acoustical value, while a [[coffer]]ed ceiling is divided into a grid of recessed square or octagonal panels, also called a \"lacunar ceiling\". A cove ceiling uses a curved [[Molding (decorative)|plaster transition]] between wall and ceiling; it is named for cove molding, a molding with a concave curve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manleylabs.com/galleria/casaratas/casaratas52.html |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929160228/http://www.manleylabs.com/galleria/casaratas/casaratas52.html |archivedate=September 29, 2008 }}</ref> A stretched ceiling (or stretch ceiling) uses a number of individual panels using material such as [[PVC]] fixed to a perimeter rail.<ref>{{cite book|title=Interior Graphic Standards: Student Edition|author=Corky Binggeli|p=220|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-1-118-09935-3}}</ref>\n\n==Elements==\n\nCeilings have frequently been decorated with [[fresco]] painting, [[mosaic]] [[tile|tiles]] and other surface treatments.

Between the structure that the dropped ceiling is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of [[drywall]], there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run.\n\nAn independent ceiling, however, can be constructed such that it has a stand-alone fire-resistance rating. Such systems must be tested without the benefit of being suspended from a slab above in order to prove that the resulting system is capable of holding itself up.
