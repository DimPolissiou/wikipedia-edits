He has lent a multidisciplinary approach to the writing and publication of numerous articles discussing a wide range of musical topics and ideas. \n\nBlum's writing displays a strong knowledge of parallel disciplines through the thoughtful inclusion of academic theory from the fields of sociology, [[historical musicology]], philosophy, [[anthropology]], [[Musical composition|composition]] and [[analysis]]. Through his continued participation and critiques, he has made numerous contributions to the dialogue surrounding the fields of ethnomusicology and [[musicology]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nBlum received a bachelor's degree from [[Oberlin College]] in 1964,and then a PhD in music at the [[University of Illinois]]. As a PhD student Blum worked with music scholars including Alexander Ringer, [[Charles Hamm]], and [[Bruno Nettl]].<ref>Theodore Levin, \"Blum, Stephen,\" ''Grove Music Online.

Retrieved February 12, 2014, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/19761.</ref>\n\n==Academic appointments==\n\nBlum\u2019s teaching career began at [[Western Illinois University]] (1967\u201373), followed by an assistant professorship at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] until 1977. He then moved to Toronto's [[York University]] where he remained for ten years, founding the MFA program \"Music and Contemporary Cultures\" the first of its kind Canada. In 1987 he founded the ethnomusicology program at [[City College of New York]] Graduate Center where he worked until his retirement in 2016.\n\n== Scholarship and legacy ==\n\nBlum's ethnographic focus on northeastern Iran in his PhD dissertation led to a number of published articles early in his career discussing the folk singing traditions of these regions. His final observations were not just theoretical but took into consideration the racial and classist attitudes among his informants, the implications of which are included in his ethnographic work. In his article, \"The Concept of the \u2018Asheq in Northern Khorasan\" (1972) Blum presents part of his fieldwork undertaken in 1969 for his dissertation but pointedly focuses on social folk music of the (primarily) Kurdish minority. In 1974 his article, \"Persian Folksong in Meshhed (Iran)\" Blum continued a detailed rhythmic and melodic analysis of ten folk songs while focusing on informant-perceived rural and urban difference in style and performance. He observed that a lack of singing and dancing in Iranian society is not linked to a rural and urban divide but is a privation of poverty. He noted that \"the high degree of differentiations in Iranian society not only ensures the member of one group (defined by place of residence, occupation, ethnic identity, or whatever combination of diverse attributes) will often lack, or at least deny, first-hand knowledge of activities within other groups\"<ref>Stephen Blum, \"Persian Folksong in Meshhed (Iran), 1969,\" ''Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council'', VI (1974), 101.</ref>\n\nWith Ameneh Youssefzadeh, Blum is the consulting editor in music for [[The encyclopedia Iranica|''The Encyclopedia Iranica'']]. He is also the author of a number of entries in [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'']] and has contributed to the three volumes of the ''Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'' devoted to the United States and Canada, the Middle East, and Europe. \n\nBlum often returned to his Western roots, a prominent example being an article on the writing and music of [[Charles Ives]] published in 1977 in [[The Musical Quarterly]]. He discusses and analyzes Ives\u2019 music through his writing, tackling the motivations and perceptions of a stubborn and controversial artist, concluding that Ives\u2019  \"musical techniques aimed to explore 'processes of musical differentiation' in relationships of sounds, with reference to their social and moral contexts.\" He has often tackled theoretical issues in musicology, ethnomusicology.\n\nThe field recordings from his research trips to [[Iran]] were donated to [[Harvard University]] where they have been digitized and posted publicly online.<ref>[https://library.harvard.edu/collections/stephen-blum-collection-music-iranian-khorasan Stephen Blum Collection of Music From Iranian Khor\u0101s\u0101n] </ref> In 1995, Blum donated copies of this collection to Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.\n\n==Publications==\n* \"Meter and Rhythm in the Sung Poetry of Iranian Khorasan,\" in ''Thought and Play in Musical Rhythm'', ed.

Nettl\u2019s widespread influence was further Blum was to later co-edit   the  1991   festschrift for Nettl,  ''Ethnomusicology and Modern Music History'' along with  former Nettl students [[Philip V. Bohlman]] and Daniel M. Neuman.<ref>Philip V. Bohlman, \"Nettl, Bruno,\" ''Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved February 12, 2014, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/19761.</ref>\n\n==Academic appointments==\n\nBlum\u2019s teaching career began at [[Western Illinois University]] (1967\u201373), followed by an assistant professorship at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] until 1977. He then moved to Toronto's [[York University]] where he remained for ten years, founding the MFA program \"Music and Contemporary Cultures\" the first of its kind Canada. In 1987 he founded the ethnomusicology program at [[City College of New York]] Graduate Center where he worked until his retirement in 2016.\n\n== Scholarship and legacy ==\n\nBlum's ethnographic focus on northeastern Iran in his PhD dissertation led to a number of published articles early in his career discussing the folk singing traditions of these regions. His final observations were not just theoretical but took into consideration the racial and classist attitudes among his informants, the implications of which are included in his ethnographic work. In his article, \"The Concept of the \u2018Asheq in Northern Khorasan\" (1972) Blum presents part of his fieldwork undertaken in 1969 for his dissertation but pointedly focuses on social folk music of the (primarily) Kurdish minority. In 1974 his article, \"Persian Folksong in Meshhed (Iran)\" Blum continued a detailed rhythmic and melodic analysis of ten folk songs while focusing on informant-perceived rural and urban difference in style and performance. He observed that a lack of singing and dancing in Iranian society is not linked to a rural and urban divide but is a privation of poverty. He noted that \"the high degree of differentiations in Iranian society not only ensures the member of one group (defined by place of residence, occupation, ethnic identity, or whatever combination of diverse attributes) will often lack, or at least deny, first-hand knowledge of activities within other groups\"<ref>Stephen Blum, \"Persian Folksong in Meshhed (Iran), 1969,\" ''Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council'', VI (1974), 101.</ref>\n\nWith Ameneh Youssefzadeh, Blum is the consulting editor in music for [[The encyclopedia Iranica|''The Encyclopedia Iranica'']]. He is also the author of a number of entries in [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'']] and has contributed to the three volumes of the ''Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'' devoted to the United States and Canada, the Middle East, and Europe. \n\nBlum often returned to his Western roots, a prominent example being an article on the writing and music of [[Charles Ives]] published in 1977 in [[The Musical Quarterly]]. He discusses and analyzes Ives\u2019 music through his writing, tackling the motivations and perceptions of a stubborn and controversial artist, concluding that Ives\u2019  \"musical techniques aimed to explore 'processes of musical differentiation' in relationships of sounds, with reference to their social and moral contexts.\" He has often tackled theoretical issues in musicology, ethnomusicology.\n\nThe field recordings from his research trips to [[Iran]] were donated to [[Harvard University]] where they have been digitized and posted publicly online.<ref>[https://library.harvard.edu/collections/stephen-blum-collection-music-iranian-khorasan Stephen Blum Collection of Music From Iranian Khor\u0101s\u0101n] </ref> In 1995, Blum donated copies of this collection to Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.\n\n==Publications==\n* \"Meter and Rhythm in the Sung Poetry of Iranian Khorasan,\" in ''Thought and Play in Musical Rhythm'', ed.
