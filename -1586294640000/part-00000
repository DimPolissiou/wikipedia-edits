The new route would take the plane over [[Dari\u00e9n Province]]. 6 minutes later, at 20:54 (8:54&nbsp;p.m.), Panama City Control Center received a third message from Captain Chial, who reported problems with the airplane and made a request to turn back to Tocumen, which was granted.\n\nHowever, at 20:56 (8:56&nbsp;p.m.), 2 minutes later, while flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet (7,620 metres), Flight 201 entered a steep dive at an angle of 80 degrees to the right and began to roll uncontrollably while accelerating towards the ground. Despite the attempts by Captain Chial and First Officer Tejada to level off, the airplane continued its steep dive, until it exceeded the speed of sound and started to break apart at 10,000 feet (3,048 metres). Most of the bodies had their clothes torn off and were thrown away from the aircraft.<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/> Flight 201 crashed into a jungle area within the Darien Gap at 486 knots (560 miles per hour, 900 kilometres per hour), instantly killing everyone still on board.<ref>{{cite news |title= Explosi\u00f3n en avion: fallecen 47 personas |author= El Tiempo |url= http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-133013 |date= June 11, 2012<!-- 5:12 AM-->|accessdate=June 11, 2012 <!-- 5:12 AM --> }}</ref>\n\nAt 20:57 (8:57&nbsp;p.m.), Tocumen Air Traffic Control tried unsuccessfully to make contact with flight until it received a radio message from a KLM DC-10 aircraft that was approaching the airport, reporting that they intercepted a distress signal from Flight 201's transponder in an area between the Colombian border and Darien Province, several kilometres away from their position.

Due to a short circuit the indicators on flight 201 showed faulty readings, confusing the pilots.]]\n\nThe [[cockpit voice recorder]] was recovered and flown to Panama City, then to the United States, for analysis by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/> However, NTSB analysts discovered that the tape was broken due to a maintenance error. Crash investigators had better luck with the [[flight data recorder]], which showed the plane was in a high-speed dive before breaking up.<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/>\n\nThe trouble was later traced to a faulty wiring harness in the [[Attitude Director Indicator]] (ADI) instruments. The wires were frayed due to damage by long term over-stress, which caused an intermittent short circuit in the flow of data from the pilot side Vertical Gyro (VG), VG-1, to the pilot side ADI.\n\nThis issue was compounded on the accident flight. There are two ADI displays, fed independently by their own VG &ndash; one ADI/VG pair for the pilot, a separate pair for the co-pilot. In case one of the VG has a problem, the crew can manually switch either ADI to use the other VG. The switch of the Captain's ADI was found at the scene of the accident in the \u201cBoth on VG-1\u201d position, feeding both of the ADI from the same, intermittently faulty, pilot side VG.\n\nAs a consequence, both the ADI would momentarily stay unchanged (no new data making it through), leading the crew  to believe the plane was still flying in a particular attitude, thereby prompting a further control input by the crew, expecting the ADI to show that they had achieved the new attitude as requested.  In essence, the ADI told the crew the plane was still banking left, thereby prompting more pilot input to bank right. This reaction rolled the aircraft to almost 80 degrees and caused it to go into a steep dive, with no chance for recovery.<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/>\n\nThe investigation team also found that the backup ADI (Stand-by) was probably available to the pilots during the intermittent failure of the main instruments systems (the post-impact damage of the Stand-by indicator showed that it was operating properly up to impact with the ground), but due to an ineffective cross-checking procedure done by the pilots, the backup ADI was not used correctly to identify the problem and select a reliable source of attitude information.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crash was that the Copa Airlines\u2019 ground training simulator program was ineffective, as it did not present enough information relating to the differences between aircraft and crew resource management in order to give to the flight crew knowledge to overcome intermittent attitude indicator errors and to maintain control of an aircraft with the ADI/VG auxiliary instruments. Moreover, on the accident aircraft, the pilots were trying to apply what they had learned in the simulator relating to this issue, but due to the movement of the ADI's switch to the position of \u201cBoth on VG-1\u201d and the insufficient information during their training; the reference from VG-2 was lost and the pilots were unable to identify the problem as a consequence.<ref name=flight201infob>{{cite web|url=http://www.pprune.org/tech-log/498311-1992-crash-copa-airlines-737-south-america-storm-encounter.html |title=1992 crash of Copa Airlines 737 in South America in storm encounter|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref name=flight201infoc>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19920606-0.html |title=ASN Aircraft Accident Boeing 737-204 HP-1205CMP Tucuti|publisher=Aviation Safety Network |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crash was the non-standard cockpit configurations between aircraft in the fleet of the company, including inconsistencies between aircraft and the simulators used for training. This caused confusion to the pilots about determining the setting of the ADI switches for the aircraft that was being operated at the time.\n\nDespite bearing some similarities to other [[Boeing 737 rudder issues|incidents related to the Boeing 737 during the 1990s]] (such as [[United Airlines Flight 585]]), the possibility of rudder deflection in flight was discarded as a possible cause of the crash.

Despite the attempts by Captain Chial and First Officer Tejada to level off, the airplane continued its steep dive, until it exceeded the speed of sound and started to break apart at 10,000 feet (3,048 metres).

Due to a short circuit the indicators on flight 201 showed faulty readings, confusing the pilots.]]\n\nThe [[cockpit voice recorder]] was recovered and flown to Panama City, then to the United States, for analysis by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/> However, NTSB analysts discovered that the tape was broken due to a maintenance error. Crash investigators had better luck with the [[flight data recorder]], which showed the plane was in a high-speed dive before breaking up.<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/>\n\nThe trouble was later traced to a faulty wiring harness in the [[Attitude Director Indicator]] (ADI) instruments. The wires were frayed due to damage by long term over-stress, which caused an intermittent short circuit in the flow of data from the pilot side Vertical Gyro (VG), VG-1, to the pilot side ADI.\n\nThis issue was compounded on the accident flight. There are two ADI displays, fed independently by their own VG &ndash; one ADI/VG pair for the pilot, a separate pair for the co-pilot. In case one of the VG has a problem, the crew can manually switch either ADI to use the other VG. The switch of the Captain's ADI was found at the scene of the accident in the \u201cBoth on VG-1\u201d position, feeding both of the ADI from the same, intermittently faulty, pilot side VG.\n\nAs a consequence, both the ADI would momentarily stay unchanged (no new data making it through), leading the crew  to believe the plane was still flying in a particular attitude, thereby prompting a further control input by the crew, expecting the ADI to show that they had achieved the new attitude as requested.  In essence, the ADI told the crew the plane was still banking left, thereby prompting more pilot input to bank right. This reaction rolled the aircraft to almost 80 degrees and caused it to go into a steep dive, with no chance for recovery.<ref name=\"The Internet Movie Database\"/>\n\nThe investigation team also found that the backup ADI (Stand-by) was probably available to the pilots during the intermittent failure of the main instruments systems (the post-impact damage of the Stand-by indicator showed that it was operating properly up to impact with the ground), but due to an ineffective cross-checking procedure done by the pilots, the backup ADI was not used correctly to identify the problem and select a reliable source of attitude information.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crash was that the Copa Airlines\u2019 ground training simulator program was ineffective, as it did not present enough information relating to the differences between aircraft and crew resource management in order to give to the flight crew knowledge to overcome intermittent attitude indicator errors and to maintain control of an aircraft with the ADI/VG auxiliary instruments. Moreover, on the accident aircraft, the pilots were trying to apply what they had learned in the simulator relating to this issue, but due to the movement of the ADI\u2019s switch to the position of \u201cBoth on VG-1\u201d and the insufficient information during their training; the reference from VG-2 was lost and the pilots were unable to identify the problem as a consequence.<ref name=flight201infob>{{cite web|url=http://www.pprune.org/tech-log/498311-1992-crash-copa-airlines-737-south-america-storm-encounter.html |title=1992 crash of Copa Airlines 737 in South America in storm encounter|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref><ref name=flight201infoc>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19920606-0.html |title=ASN Aircraft Accident Boeing 737-204 HP-1205CMP Tucuti|publisher=Aviation Safety Network |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crash was the non-standard cockpit configurations between aircraft in the fleet of the company, including inconsistencies between aircraft and the simulators used for training. This caused confusion to the pilots about determining the setting of the ADI switches for the aircraft that was being operated at the time.\n\nDespite bearing some similarities to other [[Boeing 737 rudder issues|incidents related to the Boeing 737 during the 1990s]] (such as [[United Airlines Flight 585]]), the possibility of rudder deflection in flight was discarded as a possible cause of the crash. However, Flight 201 was registered on the category of \"accidents related to suspicious rudder deflection\".\n\n===Eyewitness accounts===\nIn the morning of the next day, Colombian and Panamanian radio stations were reporting that some residents of Tucut\u00ed and other villages nearby to the crash site said that on the night of the accident they felt a very strong explosion, meanwhile others said that they saw a burning object that was falling from the sky towards the jungle.<ref>{{cite news |title= Un Boeing 737 paname\u00f1o se estrella en la selva con 47 personas a bordo |author= ABC Hemeroteca |url= http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1992/06/08/094.html |date= June 8, 1992<!-- 5:12 AM-->|accessdate=August 26, 2013 <!-- 7:20 PM --> }}</ref>\n\nHowever, these reports were eventually dismissed by the head of Panama's civil aviation authority, Zosimo Guardia.<ref name=\"Panama Plane Wreckage Found\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n=== Response from Copa Airlines ===\nIn the wake of the disaster, Copa gave flights to Panama City to the families of the victims; the main executive members of Copa Holdings declared a permanent emergency meeting session at the airline's main headquarters in Panama City.\n\nCopa Airlines had to strengthen its training program for flight crews: in particular, for pilots learning to fly different types of aircraft, and in several skills such as overcome intermittent Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) errors and the ability to maintain control of the aircraft during instrument failures in adverse weather conditions.

As a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing [[Illinois's 16th congressional district]] from 1961 to 1981. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], he ran an [[Independent politician|independent]] campaign for president, receiving 6.6% of the popular vote.\n\nBorn in [[Rockford, Illinois]], Anderson practiced law after serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War II]]. After a stint in the [[United States Foreign Service]], he won election as the State's Attorney for [[Winnebago County, Illinois]]. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1960 in a strongly Republican district. Initially one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the House, Anderson's views moderated during the 1960s, particularly regarding social issues. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] in 1969 and remained in that position until 1979. He strongly criticized the [[Vietnam War]] as well as President [[Richard Nixon]]'s actions during the [[Watergate scandal]].\n\nAnderson entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Republican presidential primaries]], introducing his signature campaign proposal of raising the [[Fuel taxes in the United States|gas tax]] while cutting [[Social Security (United States)#Taxation|social security taxes]]. He established himself as a contender for the nomination in the early primaries, but eventually dropped out of the Republican race, choosing to pursue an independent campaign for president. In the election, he finished third behind Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] and Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]]. He won support among [[Rockefeller Republican]]s, independents, liberal intellectuals, and college students.\n\nAfter the election, he resumed his legal career and helped found [[FairVote]], an organization that advocates [[electoral reform]]s such as [[instant-runoff voting]]. He also won a lawsuit against the state of [[Ohio]], ''[[Anderson v. Celebrezze]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down early filing deadlines for independent candidates. Anderson served as a visiting professor at numerous universities and was on the boards of several organizations. He endorsed [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000 and helped found the [[Justice Party (United States)|Justice Party]] in 2012.\n\n==Early life==\nAnderson was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], where he grew up, the son of Mabel Edna (n\u00e9e Ring) and E.

As a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing [[Illinois's 16th congressional district]] from 1961 to 1981. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], he ran an [[Independent politician|independent]] campaign for president, receiving 6.6% of the popular vote.\n\nBorn in [[Rockford, Illinois]], Anderson practiced law after serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War II]]. After a stint in the [[United States Foreign Service]], he won election as the State's Attorney for [[Winnebago County, Illinois]]. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1960 in a strongly Republican district. Initially one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the House, Anderson's views moderated during the 1960s, particularly regarding social issues. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] in 1969 and remained in that position until 1979. He strongly criticized the [[Vietnam War]] as well as President [[Richard Nixon]]'s actions during the [[Watergate scandal]].\n\nAnderson entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Republican presidential primaries]], introducing his signature campaign proposal of raising the [[Fuel taxes in the United States|gas tax]] while cutting [[Social Security (United States)#Taxation|social security taxes]]. He established himself as a contender for the nomination in the early primaries, but eventually dropped out of the Republican race, choosing to pursue an independent campaign for president. In the election, he finished third behind Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] and Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]]. He won support among [[Rockefeller Republican]]s, independents, liberal intellectuals, and college students.\n\nAfter the election, he resumed his legal career and helped found [[FairVote]], an organization that advocates [[electoral reform]]s such as [[instant-runoff voting]]. He also won a lawsuit against the state of [[Ohio]], ''[[Anderson v. Celebrezze]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down early filing deadlines for independent candidates. Anderson served as a visiting professor at numerous universities and was on the boards of several organizations. He endorsed [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000 and helped found the [[Justice Party (United States)|Justice Party]] in 2012.\n\n==Early life==\nAnderson was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], where he grew up, the son of Mabel Edna (n\u00e9e Ring) and E.

McKenna]] hired to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"Dreamworks\" /> [[Ang Lee]] joined the project as a producer in 2004, but the film did not materialize after that point and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel.<ref name=\"NorringtonLee\" /> In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO [[Avi Arad]] announced Shang-Chi as one of ten properties being developed as films by the newly formed studio [[Marvel Studios]],<ref name=\"IGNSept05\" /> after the fledgling company received financing to produce the slate of ten films which were to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"10Films\" />\n\nBy December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer [[David Callaham]] to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to explore \"Asian and Asian-American themes, crafted by Asian and Asian-American filmmakers\", as they had done for African and African-American culture with ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' earlier in 2018.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Development of the film also came following the success of the film ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]'', also released earlier in 2018, which led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.<ref name=\"Callaham2\" /> Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the character's comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Richard Newby of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film could \"break out in a way similar to ''Black Panther''\" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it \"speaks volumes\" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film is an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be \"more than Marvel's Bruce Lee\".<ref name=\"THRNewbyDec2018\" />\n\nMarvel Studios hired Japanese-American filmmaker [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] to direct the film in March 2019. [[Deborah Chow]]\u2014who previously directed episodes of Marvel's ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' and ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' television series\u2014Justin Tipping, and [[Alan Yang]] were also considered.<ref name=\"THRCrettonMarch2019\" /> In April, Marvel Studios and Australian [[Minister for the Arts (Australia)|Arts Minister]] [[Mitch Fifield]] announced that an upcoming Marvel film, believed to be ''Shang-Chi'', would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of [[New South Wales]]. The production received AU$24 million (US${{To USD|24|AUS|round=yes}} million) in one-off funding from the Australian government, as well as backing from the AU$10 million (US${{To USD|10|AUS|round=yes}} million) \"Made in NSW\" state fund. The production was expected to generate AU$150 million (US${{To USD|150|AUS|round=yes}} million) for the Australian economy as well as 4,700 new jobs, while taking advantage of around 1,200 local businesses.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> [[Don Harwin]], the [[Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts|New South Wales Arts Minister]], confirmed in July that this film was ''Shang-Chi'' and revealed that it would be produced [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] with Marvel Studios' ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022); production on ''Shang-Chi'' was set to be completed before work began on ''Love and Thunder'' later in 2020.<ref name=\"NSWThorShangChi\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn mid-July, Marvel began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi. The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character.<ref name=\"KrollCasting\" /> This group included [[Simu Liu]], who tested for the part on July 14 and was officially cast on July 16. This was announced by producer [[Kevin Feige]]  and Cretton at Marvel Studios's [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel on July 20, where the film's full title was announced to be ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''. Feige noted that the Ten Rings organization had appeared throughout the MCU since its introduction in the franchise's first film, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), and said its leader the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] would be introduced in this film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] in the role; [[Ben Kingsley]] previously portrayed [[Trevor Slattery|an impostor]] posing as the Mandarin in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013). Feige also announced that [[Awkwafina]] would appear in the film.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> Filming was expected to begin in November 2019,<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> but Cretton said in October that production would begin in early 2020.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> In December, Feige said the film would feature predominantly Asian cast members.<ref name=\"FeigeAsianCast\" /> A month later, [[Michelle Yeoh]] entered talks for a role in the film, said to be different from [[Aleta Ogord]], who Yeoh portrayed in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Yeoh\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020,<ref name=\"FeigeLATimesMarch2020\" /><ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> shooting at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of New South Wales.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> Filming was also expected to take place in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> [[Bill Pope]] serves as cinematographer for the film. Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on ''[[The Matrix]]'', which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> On March 12, after studios had started halting production on films due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Cretton decided to have himself [[COVID-19 testing|tested]] for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus]] after working closely with people who had potentially been exposed to it.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /><ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> This was a precaution due to Cretton having a newborn baby, and he self-isolated himself while awaiting these results;<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> the test later came back negative.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> With Cretton self-isolating, Marvel temporarily suspended first unit production for the film but intended for second unit and other aspects of the production to continue as normal.<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> On March 13, the rest of the film's production was paused as Disney halted filming on most of its projects.<ref name=\"AllUnitsSuspended\" /> Before production shut down, [[Ronny Chieng]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"ChiengCast\" /> In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the coronavirus pandemic, moving ''Shang-Chi''{{'}}s release date to May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released on May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was previously scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]],<ref name=\"SCMPReaction\" /> but this was shifted to the May 2021 date because of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"10Films\">{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |title=Marvel to Make Movies Based on Comic Books |last=Vincent |first=Rodger |date=September 6, 2005 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ory848wW?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Callaham\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/shang-chi-marvel-studios-first-asian-film-superhero-dave-callaham-kevin-feige-black-panther-1202512660/ |title='Shang-Chi' Marvel's First Asian Film Superhero Franchise;

[[Shang-Chi]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 26th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] from a screenplay by [[David Callaham]] and stars [[Simu Liu]] as Shang-Chi, alongside [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and [[Awkwafina]].\n\nA film based on Shang-Chi has been in development since 2001, but work did not begin in earnest on the project until 2018 with the hiring of Callaham. Cretton joined in early 2019, with the project fast-tracked to be Marvel's first film with an Asian lead. The film's title and primary cast were announced that July, revealing the film's connection to the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] (Leung) and his Ten Rings organization that appear throughout the MCU. Filming began in February 2020, with locations including Australia and Los Angeles. The production was put on hold in March due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 7, 2021.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Simu Liu by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Simu Liu at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Simu Liu]] as [[Shang-Chi]]: A skilled martial artist.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" />\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] as the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]]:<br />The leader of the Ten Rings terrorist organization. The Mandarin replaces Shang-Chi's comic book father [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Fu Manchu]], a \"problematic character\" [[Fu Manchu#Controversy|associated with racist stereotypes]] whom Marvel Studios does not hold the film rights to.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> Director [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] stated that he wanted to change the problematic aspects of the Mandarin, saying, \"I think [Leung] brings a humanity that we need for that character. We are not looking to contribute anymore to the Asian stereotypes that we have seen both in cinema and pop culture... [Leung] is such an incredible actor and I'm excited to have him help us break some of those stereotypes\".<ref name=\"ObserverSept2019\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Awkwafina]], [[Ronny Chieng]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /><ref name=\"ChiengCast\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to [[Margaret Loesch]], former President and CEO of [[Marvel Productions]], [[Stan Lee]] discussed a potential [[Shang-Chi]] film or television series with actor [[Brandon Lee]] and his mother [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Lee]] during the 1980s, with the intention of having Brandon Lee star as the character in such a project.<ref name=\"BrandonLee\" /> Brandon's father, martial arts legend [[Bruce Lee]], was the visual inspiration for artist [[Paul Gulacy]] when drawing Shang-Chi during his tenure on the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' comic book series in the 1970s.<ref name=\"CBA7\" /> In 2001, [[Stephen Norrington]] announced his intentions to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled ''The Hands of Shang-Chi''.<ref name=\"BloodyDisgusting\" /> By 2003, the film was in development at [[DreamWorks Pictures]] with [[Yuen Woo-Ping]] replacing Norrington as director and [[Bruce C. McKenna]] hired to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"Dreamworks\" /> [[Ang Lee]] joined the project as a producer in 2004, but the film did not materialize after that point and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel.<ref name=\"NorringtonLee\" /> In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO [[Avi Arad]] announced Shang-Chi as one of ten properties being developed as films by the newly formed studio [[Marvel Studios]],<ref name=\"IGNSept05\" /> after the fledgling company received financing to produce the slate of ten films which were to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"10Films\" />\n\nBy December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer [[David Callaham]] to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to explore \"Asian and Asian-American themes, crafted by Asian and Asian-American filmmakers\", as they had done for African and African-American culture with ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' earlier in 2018.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Development of the film also came following the success of the film ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]'', also released earlier in 2018, which led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.<ref name=\"Callaham2\" /> Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the character's comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Richard Newby of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film could \"break out in a way similar to ''Black Panther''\" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it \"speaks volumes\" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film is an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be \"more than Marvel's Bruce Lee\".<ref name=\"THRNewbyDec2018\" />\n\nMarvel Studios hired Japanese-American filmmaker [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] to direct the film in March 2019. [[Deborah Chow]]\u2014who previously directed episodes of Marvel's ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' and ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' television series\u2014Justin Tipping, and [[Alan Yang]] were also considered.<ref name=\"THRCrettonMarch2019\" /> In April, Marvel Studios and Australian [[Minister for the Arts (Australia)|Arts Minister]] [[Mitch Fifield]] announced that an upcoming Marvel film, believed to be ''Shang-Chi'', would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of [[New South Wales]]. The production received AU$24 million (US${{To USD|24|AUS|round=yes}} million) in one-off funding from the Australian government, as well as backing from the AU$10 million (US${{To USD|10|AUS|round=yes}} million) \"Made in NSW\" state fund. The production was expected to generate AU$150 million (US${{To USD|150|AUS|round=yes}} million) for the Australian economy as well as 4,700 new jobs, while taking advantage of around 1,200 local businesses.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> [[Don Harwin]], the [[Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts|New South Wales Arts Minister]], confirmed in July that this film was ''Shang-Chi'' and revealed that it would be produced [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] with Marvel Studios' ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022); production on ''Shang-Chi'' was set to be completed before work began on ''Love and Thunder'' later in 2020.<ref name=\"NSWThorShangChi\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn mid-July, Marvel began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi. The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character.<ref name=\"KrollCasting\" /> This group included [[Simu Liu]], who tested for the part on July 14 and was officially cast on July 16. This was announced by producer [[Kevin Feige]]  and Cretton at Marvel Studios's [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel on July 20, where the film's full title was announced to be ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''. Feige noted that the Ten Rings organization had appeared throughout the MCU since its introduction in the franchise's first film, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), and said its leader the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] would be introduced in this film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] in the role; [[Ben Kingsley]] previously portrayed [[Trevor Slattery|an impostor]] posing as the Mandarin in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013). Feige also announced that [[Awkwafina]] would appear in the film.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> Filming was expected to begin in November 2019,<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> but Cretton said in October that production would begin in early 2020.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> In December, Feige said the film would feature predominantly Asian cast members.<ref name=\"FeigeAsianCast\" /> A month later, [[Michelle Yeoh]] entered talks for a role in the film, said to be different from [[Aleta Ogord]], who Yeoh portrayed in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Yeoh\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020,<ref name=\"FeigeLATimesMarch2020\" /><ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> shooting at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of New South Wales.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> Filming was also expected to take place in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> [[Bill Pope]] serves as cinematographer for the film. Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on ''[[The Matrix]]'', which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> On March 12, after studios had started halting production on films due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Cretton decided to have himself [[COVID-19 testing|tested]] for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus]] after working closely with people who had potentially been exposed to it.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /><ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> This was a precaution due to Cretton having a newborn baby, and he self-isolated himself while awaiting these results;<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> the test later came back negative.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> With Cretton self-isolating, Marvel temporarily suspended first unit production for the film but intended for second unit and other aspects of the production to continue as normal.<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> On March 13, the rest of the film's production was paused as Disney halted filming on most of its projects.<ref name=\"AllUnitsSuspended\" /> In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the coronavirus pandemic, moving ''Shang-Chi''{{'}}s release date to May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released on May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was previously scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]],<ref name=\"SCMPReaction\" /> but this was shifted to the May 2021 date because of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"10Films\">{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |title=Marvel to Make Movies Based on Comic Books |last=Vincent |first=Rodger |date=September 6, 2005 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ory848wW?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Callaham\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/shang-chi-marvel-studios-first-asian-film-superhero-dave-callaham-kevin-feige-black-panther-1202512660/ |title='Shang-Chi' Marvel's First Asian Film Superhero Franchise;
