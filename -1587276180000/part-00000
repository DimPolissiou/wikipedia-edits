The band toured, promoted the EP, appeared in the movie ''[[Lunch Wagon]]'' (1981), and became a must-see band among the Los Angeles live music crowd.  \"Mental Hopscotch\" was a No.&nbsp;1 record on local radio station [[KROQ-FM]], and the self-promoted EP sold 7,000 copies.\n\nTwo years of hard work led up to a signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1982.  With label support, the re-released 4-song EP\u2014with the song \"Words\" replacing the Doors cover \"[[Hello, I Love You]]\"\u2014sold another 250,000 units.  The band also added Wild and O'Hearn to the line up, and recorded a new full-length album ''[[Spring Session M]]'' (1982), the title of which was an [[anagram]] of 'Missing Persons'.  The album included both \"Words\" and \"Destination Unknown\" from the initial EP, and went [[RIAA certification|gold]].\n\n''[[Spring Session M]]'' spun off four singles: \"[[Destination Unknown (song)|Destination Unknown]]\", \"Words\", \"Walking in L.A.\",  and \"Windows\", all of which made the Billboard [[Hot 100]], although none charted higher than #42.  The band did experience considerable success in the local markets of [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[San Francisco]].  As well, the [[visual effects]] used in the [[music video]] for \"Words\" were unusual for the time, making it popular on the fledgling cable TV channel [[MTV]].\n\nMissing Persons appeared at a three-day Southern California concert known as the [[US Festival]], Monday, May 30, 1983, along with [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Pretenders]], [[U2]], [[Little Steven & The Disciples of Soul]], [[Quarterflash]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Los Lobos]] (side stage only), and [[Stevie Nicks]].\n\n=== Decline and ''Rhyme & Reason'' (1984\u20131986) ===\nThe group followed up their debut with the experimental album ''[[Rhyme & Reason (Missing Persons album)|Rhyme & Reason]]'' (1984), which was neither a commercial nor a critical success.  The video for \"Surrender Your Heart\" was designed by [[Peter Max]] and received play on MTV, but the track failed to reach the Hot 100.  Only the single \"Give\" met with any chart response.  Wild left Missing Persons after this album, and was not replaced.\n\nCapitol was not happy about the direction the band was taking, as well as their commercial downturn. Consequently, production reins for the third album were given to [[Bernard Edwards]] of proven hitmakers [[Chic]]; he had also recently produced [[The Power Station (album)|The Power Station]].  The result was the more conventional album ''[[Color in Your Life]]'' which was issued in June 1986 and only had a minor hit \u201cI Can\u2019t Think About Dancin\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the short-lived promotional tour for ''Color in Your Life'', increasing tensions between Terry and Dale Bozzio led to the end of the tour, the couple's marriage, and the band.\n\n==Reunions==\n===2001\u20132003===\nIn late 2000, Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio again began discussing a Missing Persons reunion.  In May 2001, after Warren's split with Duran Duran, the new Missing Persons appeared, consisting of original members Warren, Dale and Terry. Joining them were Ron Poster (jazz pianist and organist for the [[Boston Bruins]] home hockey arena) and Warren's bassist, [[Wes Wehmiller]] (also formerly  Duran Duran's tour bassist from 1997\u20132001). The short-lived, official reunion consisted of promotional activities and three live performances in July 2001. The studio tracks \"Dark and Dangerous Guy\" and \"Throw Money\" that appear on ''[[Lost Tracks (Missing Persons album)|Lost Tracks]]'' (2002) were recorded at this time, as well as the live performances of \"Face to Face\" and \"Give\" on the same album. After the promotional tour ended, Terry Bozzio left the reunited band again due to unresolved issues stemming from his breakup with Dale. According to Dale in a 2004 interview, his parting words to her were \"It's all about you, Dale, it's always been about you\". In the FAQ section on his website, Terry stated that Missing Persons are a 'heartbreaker' for him, because he likes the band's music and playing with them, but that reunion failed because of 'the weirdness' with Dale. The band briefly continued with Jake Hayden taking Terry Bozzio's place but disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nLate 2002/early 2003 brought 'Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo'. They were joined again by Poster and Wehmiller as well as new drummer Joe Travers (formerly in Cuccurullo's solo band and Duran Duran's tour drummer from 1999\u20132001). This version of Missing Persons was featured on ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' (performing \"Destination Unknown\") and did three live performances in February 2003, disbanding shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronnieron.com/video.htm|title=RonnieRon - Ron Poster Video|website=www.ronnieron.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194517/http://www.ronnieron.com/video.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2009 and 2011\u2013present===\nIn 2009 Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo again reunited the band; with the line-up this time consisting of Bozzio, Cuccurullo, Travers, keyboardist [[Scheila Gonzalez]], and bassist Doug Lunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=18208|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816074413/http://www.zappa.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=18208|archivedate=2016-08-16|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-07-06}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2011, it was announced on Dale Bozzio's website that \"Dale and Warren have reformed Missing Persons for an incredible reunion tour in anticipation of the 30th Anniversary of ''Spring Session M'', the band's groundbreaking, certified-Gold album originally released in 1982.\" In the same announcement, Terry Bozzio's absence in this reunion was explained by stating that \"rock bands are dysfunctional families at best, and sometimes, the show just can't go on with all on-board.\" <ref>[http://dalebozzioofficial.com/images/news09.jpg 2011 reunion announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203205903/http://dalebozzioofficial.com/images/news09.jpg|date=2012-02-03}}</ref> In addition to Bozzio and Cuccurullo, this line-up consisted of [[Prescott Niles]] of [[the Knack]] on bass, Patrick Bolen on guitars, Fred Bensi on keyboards, and Andy Sanesi on drums. Cuccurullo again departed the band following the end of the 2011 shows; but the band has not officially dissolved since then.\n\nIn December 2014 a new Missing Persons album was issued, entitled ''Missing In Action''.  Missing Persons now consisted of Dale Bozzio and multi-instrumentalist [[Billy Sherwood]].  Sherwood played all the instruments on the record, wrote most of the material, and produced; Bozzio sang, and also co-wrote two songs.\n\n===Reunions of former members===\nSince 1986, Warren Cuccurullo, Terry Bozzio, and Patrick O'Hearn have continued to support each other's solo projects. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, Cuccurullo and Bozzio performed on some of O'Hearn's albums.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r83466|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Rivers Gonna Rise'' credits]</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r83462|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Indigo'' credits]</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r228037|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Trust'' credits]</ref> Also, Patrick O'Hearn performed in a jazz fusion group called OUTtrio with Terry Bozzio,<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/work/out-trio-470764 allmovie: ''OUT trio'' overview]</ref> and Bozzio is featured on Warren Cuccurullo's CD ''Playing in Tongues'' that was released in March, 2009.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r247459|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Metaphor'' credits]</ref>\n\n==Solo careers==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nAfter the breakup of the band, Cuccurullo had his greatest success as guitarist for [[Duran Duran]] for fifteen years. Replacing original guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] in August 1986, he performed on the albums ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' (1986) and ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988), and was the sole guitarist on the global tours that followed. Becoming an official member in June 1989, he appeared on the group's next five studio albums, and was a co-writer of the hit singles \"[[Ordinary World]]\" and \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\". He left Duran Duran in 2001 due to a reunion of the group's original members.  Warren also recorded several solo albums before leaving Duran Duran. Later he collaborated with [[Neil Carlill]] in the experimental rock band [[Chicanery]].\n\nDale Bozzio scored success as a solo performer under the name '''Dale''' with a top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Dance Chart]], \"Simon Simon\", produced by [[Robert Brookins]].  Her album ''[[Riot in English]]'' was released in 1988 on [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]] label and her album ''Make Love Not War'' and ''Talk Talk'' EP were released on related labels in 2010. With [[Cleopatra Records]] she released ''New Wave Sessions'' in 2007 and ''[[Missing In Action (Dale Bozzio album)|Missing in Action]]'' in 2014.\n\nTerry Bozzio worked in 1987 with [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Jeff Beck]].  He has played with several groups and artists as a session or tour drummer including [[The Knack]]. He records albums and instructional videos in multiple styles and is a highly sought-after session/tour drummer as well as performing constantly at European music festivals and worldwide drum clinics.  Most recently, Bozzio performed and recorded with Californian [[nu metal]] band [[Korn]], in place of regular band drummer [[David Silveria]], in preparation for their untitled eighth studio album.\n\nPatrick O'Hearn is a [[composer]] and performer of [[Ambient music|ambient]] instrumental music on his own albums, and for television and movies.\n\n[[Chuck Wild]] became an in-demand session player, playing keyboards on albums for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Paula Abdul]], and [[The Pointer Sisters]]. He composes [[New Age]] and [[meditation]] music under the name Liquid Mind,<ref>Liquid Mind discography on the [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/liquid-mind-mn0000297509/discography All Music website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902013139/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/liquid-mind-mn0000297509/discography |date=2017-09-02 }}</ref> and also has released a digital only project entitled ''Soundtrack Of The Inner World'' with singer/ songwriter [[Seven Whitfield]].\n\n==Reissues==\n''[[Spring Session M]]'' (1982) was released on CD in 1995, followed by ''[[Rhyme & Reason (Missing Persons album)|Rhyme & Reason]]'' (1984) and ''[[Color in Your Life]]'' (1986) in 2000. All three reissues included rare B-sides and/or live tracks.\n\n''Classic Masters'' is a compilation of remastered tracks and dance mixes issued by Capitol Records with no band involvement.\n\nBeginning in 1997, Cuccurullo began work on his 'Missing Persons Archival Trilogy' project. The first CD to be released was ''[[Late Nights Early Days]]'' in 1998, a live concert recorded in 1981 with the added 1980 studio track \"Action/Reaction\".  This was followed up by a compilation of modern remixes of classic MP tracks, ''Missing Persons Remixed Hits'' (1999) which included the [[TV Mania]] remix of \"Destination Unknown\". In 2002 ''[[Lost Tracks (Missing Persons album)|Lost Tracks]]'' was released, a collection of extremely rare Missing Persons studio, live and remixed tracks from five different eras of the band.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n*[[Dale Bozzio]] - vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001\u20132003, 2009, 2011\u2013present)</small>\n*Paul Vargas - keyboard, synthesizers <small>(2016\u2013present)</small>\n*Karl D'Amico - guitar <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Prescott Niles]] - bass <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n*Andy Sanesi - drums <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Former members\n*[[Terry Bozzio]] - drums, percussion, keyboards, synthesisers, guitars, vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001)</small>\n*[[Warren Cuccurullo]] - guitars, vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001\u20132003, 2009, 2011)</small>\n*[[Patrick O'Hearn]] - bass, synthesizers <small>(1981\u20131986)</small>\n*[[Chuck Wild]] - keyboards, synthesizers <small>(1981\u20131985)</small>\n*Ron Poster - keyboards, synthesizers <small>(2001\u20132003)</small>\n*Wes Wehmiller - bass <small>(2001\u20132003)</small>\n*Jake Hayden - drums <small>(2001)</small>\n*Joe Travers - drums <small>(2002\u20132003, 2009)</small>\n*[[Scheila Gonzalez]] - keyboards, synthesizers, saxophone <small>(2009)</small>\n*Doug Lunn - bass <small>(2009)</small>\n*Michael T.

The band was founded in 1980 in Los Angeles by guitarist [[Warren Cuccurullo]], vocalist [[Dale Bozzio]], and drummer [[Terry Bozzio]]. They later added bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]] and keyboardist [[Chuck Wild]]. Dale's quirky voice and heavy makeup made the band a favorite on [[MTV]] in the early 1980s.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/PERFECT/mtvearlyyears.html Perfect Sound Forever: The early, innocent (?) days of MTV para 29 Controversy as Commerce to end of article ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409013538/http://www.furious.com/PERFECT/mtvearlyyears.html |date=2010-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nDale and Terry Bozzio met while working with [[Frank Zappa]], and they married in 1979.<ref>Deirdre Donahue [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089243,00.html \u201cThey May Be Missing Persons, but Terry and Dale Bozzio Have Found Each Other\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015162559/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089243,00.html |date=2014-10-15 }}. \u2018\u2019People Magazine\u2019\u2019 Vol. 22 No.&nbsp;22 November 26, 1984 para. 11</ref> Cuccurullo encountered the pair while contributing to the Zappa album ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' (1979). O'Hearn was also a former member of Zappa's touring band, and Wild had played with a variety of bands before joining.\n\n==Early history==\n=== Early years and ''Spring Session M'' (1980\u20131983) ===\nIn 1980 the band was a trio consisting of Bozzio, Bozzio and Cuccurullo.  Augmented by session musicians, the group made its first record, a 4-song EP entitled ''Missing Persons'', in Zappa's brand-new [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen]] studios; the recording was financed by Cuccurullo's father.  The band toured, promoted the EP, appeared in the movie ''[[Lunch Wagon]]'' (1981), and became a must-see band among the Los Angeles live music crowd.  \"Mental Hopscotch\" was a No.&nbsp;1 record on local radio station [[KROQ-FM]], and the self-promoted EP sold 7,000 copies.\n\nTwo years of hard work led up to a signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1982.  With label support, the re-released 4-song EP\u2014with the song \"Words\" replacing the Doors cover \"[[Hello, I Love You]]\"\u2014sold another 250,000 units.  The band also added Wild and O'Hearn to the line up, and recorded a new full-length album ''[[Spring Session M]]'' (1982), the title of which was an [[anagram]] of 'Missing Persons'.  The album included both \"Words\" and \"Destination Unknown\" from the initial EP, and went [[RIAA certification|gold]].\n\n''[[Spring Session M]]'' spun off four singles: \"[[Destination Unknown (song)|Destination Unknown]]\", \"Words\", \"Walking in L.A.\",  and \"Windows\", all of which made the Billboard [[Hot 100]], although none charted higher than #42.  The band did experience considerable success in the local markets of [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[San Francisco]].  As well, the [[visual effects]] used in the [[music video]] for \"Words\" were unusual for the time, making it popular on the fledgling cable TV channel [[MTV]].\n\nMissing Persons appeared at a three-day Southern California concert known as the [[US Festival]], Monday, May 30, 1983, along with [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Pretenders]], [[U2]], [[Little Steven & The Disciples of Soul]], [[Quarterflash]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Los Lobos]] (side stage only), and [[Stevie Nicks]].\n\n=== Decline and ''Rhyme & Reason'' (1984\u20131986) ===\nThe group followed up their debut with the experimental album ''[[Rhyme & Reason (Missing Persons album)|Rhyme & Reason]]'' (1984), which was neither a commercial nor a critical success.  The video for \"Surrender Your Heart\" was designed by [[Peter Max]] and received play on MTV, but the track failed to reach the Hot 100.  Only the single \"Give\" met with any chart response.  Wild left Missing Persons after this album, and was not replaced.\n\nCapitol was not happy about the direction the band was taking, as well as their commercial downturn. Consequently, production reins for the third album were given to [[Bernard Edwards]] of proven hitmakers [[Chic]]; he had also recently produced [[The Power Station (album)|The Power Station]].  The result was the more conventional album ''[[Color in Your Life]]'' which was issued in June 1986 and only had a minor hit \u201cI Can\u2019t Think About Dancin\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the short-lived promotional tour for ''Color in Your Life'', increasing tensions between Terry and Dale Bozzio led to the end of the tour, the couple's marriage, and the band.\n\n==Reunions==\n===2001\u20132003===\nIn late 2000, Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio again began discussing a Missing Persons reunion.  In May 2001, after Warren's split with Duran Duran, the new Missing Persons appeared, consisting of original members Warren, Dale and Terry. Joining them were Ron Poster (jazz pianist and organist for the [[Boston Bruins]] home hockey arena) and Warren's bassist, [[Wes Wehmiller]] (also formerly  Duran Duran's tour bassist from 1997\u20132001). The short-lived, official reunion consisted of promotional activities and three live performances in July 2001. The studio tracks \"Dark and Dangerous Guy\" and \"Throw Money\" that appear on ''[[Lost Tracks (Missing Persons album)|Lost Tracks]]'' (2002) were recorded at this time, as well as the live performances of \"Face to Face\" and \"Give\" on the same album. After the promotional tour ended, Terry Bozzio left the reunited band again due to unresolved issues stemming from his breakup with Dale. According to Dale in a 2004 interview, his parting words to her were \"It's all about you, Dale, it's always been about you\". In the FAQ section on his website, Terry stated that Missing Persons are a 'heartbreaker' for him, because he likes the band's music and playing with them, but that reunion failed because of 'the weirdness' with Dale. The band briefly continued with Jake Hayden taking Terry Bozzio's place but disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nLate 2002/early 2003 brought 'Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo'. They were joined again by Poster and Wehmiller as well as new drummer Joe Travers (formerly in Cuccurullo's solo band and Duran Duran's tour drummer from 1999\u20132001). This version of Missing Persons was featured on ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' (performing \"Destination Unknown\") and did three live performances in February 2003, disbanding shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronnieron.com/video.htm|title=RonnieRon - Ron Poster Video|website=www.ronnieron.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194517/http://www.ronnieron.com/video.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2009 and 2011\u2013present===\nIn 2009 Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo again reunited the band; with the line-up this time consisting of Bozzio, Cuccurullo, Travers, keyboardist [[Scheila Gonzalez]], and bassist Doug Lunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=18208|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816074413/http://www.zappa.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=18208|archivedate=2016-08-16|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-07-06}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2011, it was announced on Dale Bozzio's website that \"Dale and Warren have reformed Missing Persons for an incredible reunion tour in anticipation of the 30th Anniversary of ''Spring Session M'', the band's groundbreaking, certified-Gold album originally released in 1982.\" In the same announcement, Terry Bozzio's absence in this reunion was explained by stating that \"rock bands are dysfunctional families at best, and sometimes, the show just can't go on with all on-board.\" <ref>[http://dalebozzioofficial.com/images/news09.jpg 2011 reunion announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203205903/http://dalebozzioofficial.com/images/news09.jpg|date=2012-02-03}}</ref> In addition to Bozzio and Cuccurullo, this line-up consisted of [[Prescott Niles]] of [[the Knack]] on bass, Patrick Bolen on guitars, Fred Bensi on keyboards, and Andy Sanesi on drums. Cuccurullo again departed the band following the end of the 2011 shows; but the band has not officially dissolved since then.\n\nIn December 2014 a new Missing Persons album was issued, entitled ''Missing In Action''.  Missing Persons now consisted of Dale Bozzio and multi-instrumentalist [[Billy Sherwood]].  Sherwood played all the instruments on the record, wrote most of the material, and produced; Bozzio sang, and also co-wrote two songs.\n\n===Reunions of former members===\nSince 1986, Warren Cuccurullo, Terry Bozzio, and Patrick O'Hearn have continued to support each other's solo projects. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, Cuccurullo and Bozzio performed on some of O'Hearn's albums.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r83466|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Rivers Gonna Rise'' credits]</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r83462|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Indigo'' credits]</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r228037|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Trust'' credits]</ref> Also, Patrick O'Hearn performed in a jazz fusion group called OUTtrio with Terry Bozzio,<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/work/out-trio-470764 allmovie: ''OUT trio'' overview]</ref> and Bozzio is featured on Warren Cuccurullo's CD ''Playing in Tongues'' that was released in March, 2009.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r247459|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: ''Metaphor'' credits]</ref>\n\n==Solo careers==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nAfter the breakup of the band, Cuccurullo had his greatest success as guitarist for [[Duran Duran]] for fifteen years. Replacing original guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] in August 1986, he performed on the albums ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' (1986) and ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988), and was the sole guitarist on the global tours that followed. Becoming an official member in June 1989, he appeared on the group's next five studio albums, and was a co-writer of the hit singles \"[[Ordinary World]]\" and \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\". He left Duran Duran in 2001 due to a reunion of the group's original members.  Warren also recorded several solo albums before leaving Duran Duran. Later he collaborated with [[Neil Carlill]] in the experimental rock band [[Chicanery]].\n\nDale Bozzio scored success as a solo performer under the name '''Dale''' with a top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Dance Chart]], \"Simon Simon\", produced by [[Robert Brookins]].  Her album ''[[Riot in English]]'' was released in 1988 on [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]] label and her album ''Make Love Not War'' and ''Talk Talk'' EP were released on related labels in 2010. With [[Cleopatra Records]] she released ''New Wave Sessions'' in 2007 and ''[[Missing In Action (Dale Bozzio album)|Missing in Action]]'' in 2014.\n\nTerry Bozzio worked in 1987 with [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Jeff Beck]].  He has played with several groups and artists as a session or tour drummer including [[The Knack]]. He records albums and instructional videos in multiple styles and is a highly sought-after session/tour drummer as well as performing constantly at European music festivals and worldwide drum clinics.  Most recently, Bozzio performed and recorded with Californian [[nu metal]] band [[Korn]], in place of regular band drummer [[David Silveria]], in preparation for their untitled eighth studio album.\n\nPatrick O'Hearn is a [[composer]] and performer of [[Ambient music|ambient]] instrumental music on his own albums, and for television and movies.\n\n[[Chuck Wild]] became an in-demand session player, playing keyboards on albums for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Paula Abdul]], and [[The Pointer Sisters]]. He composes [[New Age]] and [[meditation]] music under the name Liquid Mind,<ref>Liquid Mind discography on the [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/liquid-mind-mn0000297509/discography All Music website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902013139/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/liquid-mind-mn0000297509/discography |date=2017-09-02 }}</ref> and also has released a digital only project entitled ''Soundtrack Of The Inner World'' with singer/ songwriter [[Seven Whitfield]].\n\n==Reissues==\n''[[Spring Session M]]'' (1982) was released on CD in 1995, followed by ''[[Rhyme & Reason (Missing Persons album)|Rhyme & Reason]]'' (1984) and ''[[Color in Your Life]]'' (1986) in 2000. All three reissues included rare B-sides and/or live tracks.\n\n''Classic Masters'' is a compilation of remastered tracks and dance mixes issued by Capitol Records with no band involvement.\n\nBeginning in 1997, Cuccurullo began work on his 'Missing Persons Archival Trilogy' project. The first CD to be released was ''[[Late Nights Early Days]]'' in 1998, a live concert recorded in 1981 with the added 1980 studio track \"Action/Reaction\".  This was followed up by a compilation of modern remixes of classic MP tracks, ''Missing Persons Remixed Hits'' (1999) which included the [[TV Mania]] remix of \"Destination Unknown\". In 2002 ''[[Lost Tracks (Missing Persons album)|Lost Tracks]]'' was released, a collection of extremely rare Missing Persons studio, live and remixed tracks from five different eras of the band.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n*[[Dale Bozzio]] - vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001\u20132003, 2009, 2011\u2013present)</small>\n*Paul Vargas - keyboard, synthesizers <small>(2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Karl D'Amico - guitar <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Prescott Niles]] - bass <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n*Andy Sanesi - drums <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Former members\n*[[Terry Bozzio]] - drums, percussion, keyboards, synthesisers, guitars, vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001)</small>\n*[[Warren Cuccurullo]] - guitars, vocals <small>(1980\u20131986, 2001\u20132003, 2009, 2011)</small>\n*[[Patrick O'Hearn]] - bass, synthesizers <small>(1981\u20131986)</small>\n*[[Chuck Wild]] - keyboards, synthesizers <small>(1981\u20131985)</small>\n*Ron Poster - keyboards, synthesizers <small>(2001\u20132003)</small>\n*Wes Wehmiller - bass <small>(2001\u20132003)</small>\n*Jake Hayden - drums <small>(2001)</small>\n*Joe Travers - drums <small>(2002\u20132003, 2009)</small>\n*[[Scheila Gonzalez]] - keyboards, synthesizers, saxophone <small>(2009)</small>\n*Doug Lunn - bass <small>(2009)</small>\n*Michael T.

On August 12, 2016, TDOT announced that it would begin re-signing the route on August 14 and that work would be complete later in the year.\n\n==Route description==\nI-840 begins at an interchange in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]] near Dickson. It initially runs southeast through a predominantly hilly terrain, and crosses briefly into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later. The route remains in Hickman County for less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, before crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], and reaching an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 100|State Route 100]] (SR 100) about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point. The route then turns slightly northeast, and about {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} later reaches its eastern terminus with I-40 west of Lebanon.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-840,+Tennessee/@36.0861572,-86.596612,66351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88647b9afed8536b:0x963e9004ea8fed0f!8m2!3d36.0895955!4d-86.427016 |title = I-840 |access-date = December 18, 2017 |link = no }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=TN\n|type=SR\n|route=840\n|location=[[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]\n|formed=1991\n|deleted=2016\n|length_mi=77.28\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"840hold\"/>\n}}\n\nIn 1975 the Tennessee Highway System Plan issued by TDOT for the next four years first identified the need for an outer beltway around Nashville within the next 20 years.<ref name=FWHA>{{cite book |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation |year = 1995 |volume = Vol. 2 |title = Proposed Route 840 North from Interstate 65 to Interstate 40 West of Nashville in Robertson, Cheatham, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qrM1AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |location = Nashville |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |page =  |id = FHWA-TN-ESI-9501-D |access-date = December 18, 2017 |via = Google Books }}</ref> The SR&nbsp;840 project was initiated in 1986 with the passage of the Better Roads Program in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]].

legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

On August 12, 2016, TDOT announced that it would begin re-signing the route on August 14 and that work would be complete later in the year.\n\n==Route description==\nI-840 begins at an interchange in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]] near Dickson. It initially runs southeast through a predominantly hilly terrain, and crosses briefly into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later. The route remains in Hickman County for less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, before crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], and reaching an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 100|State Route 100]] (SR 100) about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point.

for a northern loop of I-840 north of Nashville and past Dickson, [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]], [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], and [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]] by the state legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

However, there is no record of a marriage or a contract having taken place between the Nawab and Fatima Bai or of the Nawab having recognised any of her children as his own, a prerequisite for legal paternity in Muslim family law.\n\n==Career==\nSultana was a popular actress in the silent movie era, usually cast in romantic roles.  She started her career as actress in Veer Abhimanyu (1922)<ref name=\"amazon\"/> film and later performed in several silent films. Later, she also acted in talkie movies. When India was partitioned in 1947, she migrated to [[Pakistan]] with her husband, a wealthy man named Seth Razaaq. Her daughter, Jamila Razaaq, was also encouraged by her to act in Pakistani films and she produced a film in Pakistan, named Hum Ed hain (1961), written by famous scriptwriter, [[Fayyaz Hashmi]].  The film was partly shot in colour, which was rare those days, but it failed miserably and Sultana stopped producing any films afterwards.\n<ref name=\"cine\"/>\n\nSultana's daughter, Jamila Razaaq, married the well known Pakistani cricketer [[Waqar Hasan]], who is the brother of filmmaker Iqbal Shehzad.
