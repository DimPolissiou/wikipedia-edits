It is located in Belgrade's municipality of [[Novi Beograd]], in the [[Syrmia]] region.\n\n== Location ==\n[[Image:Novi Beograd.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Be\u017eanija blocks]]\n[[Image:58848448bkosa1.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Be\u017eanijska Kosa]]\nBe\u017eanija is located west of the downtown Belgrade, across the [[Sava]] river, in the [[Syrmia]] region. It is situated in the central part of the Novi Beograd municipality, on the southern extension of the elongated, crescent-shaped yellow [[loess]] ridge of ''Be\u017eanijska kosa''. The ridge (or slope, as it is called in Serbian, ''kosa'') gives its name to the northern extension of Be\u017eanija, Be\u017eanijska Kosa, and stretches to the right banks of the [[Danube]] in the neighborhood of [[Zemun]]. Once a suburb of Belgrade, separated from it by the vast marshlands on the Sava's left bank, Be\u017eanija today forms one completely urbanized area with Belgrade thanks to the rapid development of [[Novi Beograd]] after [[World War II]]. Today, Be\u017eanija extends to the northeast into Be\u017eanijska kosa and the west into [[Ledine]].\n\n==Administration==\nAfter the World War II ended, Belgrade was divided into [[raion]]s and Be\u017eanija was part of the Raion X. When this division was abolished in 1952, Be\u017eanija became a municipality. In 1955 it was annexed to the municipality of New Belgrade, but remained as the separate settlement until 1971, when it became a ''local community'' (Serbian: ''mesna zajednica'' within Belgrade. In the 1990s, local community was administratively divided into Be\u017eanija and Be\u017eanijska Kosa.\n\n== Population ==\nBe\u017eanija experienced a rapid growth of population after 1948 as it was almost immediately attached to the newly constructed city-within-the city of Novi Beograd. As internal communal boundaries changed a lot since the 1970s, despite further expansion, censuses showed a reduced number of population as many border areas (entirely or partially) were detached from Be\u017eanija (Be\u017eanijska kosa, blocks 61-65, etc.).

The [[Habsburg Monarchy]] conquered it temporarily during the [[Great Turkish War]] (1689-1691), but it remained under Ottoman administration by the provisions of the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]] ([[Petrovaradin]] regiment of [[Slavonian Krajina]]). During the 17th and 18th centuries, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly being repopulated by the refugees from central Serbia. In 1810, population census counted 115, mostly Serbian households. By the 1850s, Austrians colonized a large number of Germans in Be\u017eanija.<ref name=\"Politika\"/> In 1848-1849 it was part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]], an ethnic Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire, but in 1849 was again placed under administration of the Military Frontier.\n\n[[Image:Belgr\u00e1d - 38-45.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Old map from 1910, showing settlements in eastern Syrmia, including Be\u017eanija]]\n\nAs the Frontier was abolished in 1881-1882, it became part of the [[Syrmia County]] within the autonomous Habsburg kingdom [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which was located within the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]].

On November 24, 1918, as part of [[Syrmia]] region, the village became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and on December 1, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (future [[Yugoslavia]]).\n\nFrom 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County and from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast. Be\u017eanija became part of the wider [[Belgrade]] area for the first time in 1929 after [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] conducted by the king [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], who, among other things, draw a new map of Yugoslavia's administrative division creating a new administrative unit ''Uprava grada Beograda'' or ''Administration of the City of Belgrade'' which comprised [[Belgrade]], [[Zemun]] (with Be\u017eanija) and [[Pan\u010devo]].

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of [[Novi Beograd]], in the [[Syrmia]] region.\n\n== Location ==\n[[Image:Novi Beograd.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Be\u017eanija blocks]]\n[[Image:58848448bkosa1.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Be\u017eanijska Kosa]]\nBe\u017eanija is located west of the downtown Belgrade, across the [[Sava]] river, in the [[Syrmia]] region. It is situated in the central part of the Novi Beograd municipality, on the southern extension of the elongated, crescent-shaped yellow [[loess]] ridge of ''Be\u017eanijska kosa''. The ridge (or slope, as it is called in Serbian, ''kosa'') gives its name to the northern extension of Be\u017eanija, Be\u017eanijska Kosa, and stretches to the right banks of the [[Danube]] in the neighborhood of [[Zemun]]. Once a suburb of Belgrade, separated from it by the vast marshlands on the Sava's left bank, Be\u017eanija today forms one completely urbanized area with Belgrade thanks to the rapid development of [[Novi Beograd]] after [[World War II]]. Today, Be\u017eanija extends to the northeast into Be\u017eanijska kosa and the west into [[Ledine]].\n\n==Administration==\nAfter the World War II ended, Belgrade was divided into [[raion]]s and Be\u017eanija was part of the Raion X. When this division was abolished in 1952, Be\u017eanija became a municipality. In 1955 it was annexed to the municipality of New Belgrade, but remained as the separate settlement until 1971, when it became a ''local community'' (Serbian: ''mesna zajednica'' within Belgrade. In the 1990s, local community was administratively divided into Be\u017eanija and Be\u017eanijska Kosa.\n\n== Population ==\nBe\u017eanija experienced a rapid growth of population after 1948 as it was almost immediately attached to the newly constructed city-within-the city of Novi Beograd. As internal communal boundaries changed a lot since the 1970s, despite further expansion, censuses showed a reduced number of population as many border areas (entirely or partially) were detached from Be\u017eanija (Be\u017eanijska kosa, blocks 61-65, etc.).

The [[Habsburg Monarchy]] conquered it temporarily during the [[Great Turkish War]] (1689-1691), but it remained under Ottoman administration by the provisions of the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]] ([[Petrovaradin]] regiment of [[Slavonian Krajina]]). During the 17th and 18th centuries, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly being repopulated by the refugees from central Serbia. In 1810, population census counted 115, mostly Serbian households.

The line was known locally as The Rattler, a term first coined by Pete Knobbler. The site of the station is now a car park. What may remain of the platform and track lies beneath tons of earth and rubble used to bring the car park up to street level. The Belmont Trail is a nature trail between Wealdstone and Stanmore running along much of the original track route. The circle was originally made for a tram line that would go across London. Its 4 exits were made due to this.<ref>https://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/9632158.Health_walk_across_Belmont_s_old_railway_line/</ref>\n\nBelmont Circle provides the main focus of the area, being a large, circular parade of that intersects Kenton Lane.  Many of the outlets are now food-related, with a few bars and a club completing the lineup.  What was formerly the Belmont (and later The Spanish Arch) pub is now 'Funky B, a bar/restaurant serving authentic Indian food. Just off the Circle, Belmont Community Hall hosts local activities, events and a regular [[jumble sale]].\n\nThere are no train stations in Belmont today but both Harrow & Wealdstone and [[Canons Park tube station]] are accessible nearby.\n\n==Demography==\nIn the 2011 census, the largest ethnic group in Belmont ward was Indian (34%), followed by White British (30%).<ref>http://www.ukcensusdata.com/belmont-e05000285</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.belmontcircle.co.uk]\n\n{{LB Harrow}}\n\n[[Category:Areas of London]]\n[[Category:Districts of the London Borough of Harrow]]\n\n\n{{London-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Textorus", "label": "safe", "comment": "nix needless italics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont,_Harrow"}

On October 12, 1962, Waters overdubbed his vocals.{{sfn|Danchin|2001|p=139}} Of the three recordings cut that day, \"Black Angel\" remains unissued.\n\nThe vocals are apparently derived from several earlier songs by Waters, such as \"[[Rollin' Stone]]\", \"Still A Fool\" and \"She's Alright\".{{Sfn|Inaba|2011|p=193}} The song is based on a guitar [[riff]] in the key of [[E minor]].{{Sfn|Inaba|2011|p=193}} Marie Dixon, Willie Dixon's wife insists that the songs is specially about her:\n\n{{Quote|text=I felt that was more close to me that he wrote is \u201cYou Need Love.\u201d If you listen to those words, I feel that.

In the United Kingdom, the single was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by a four-track EP with \"Little Brown Bird\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\" and \"Muddy Waters Twist\".

It marked the official debut of the Foo Fighters as a band, as their [[Foo Fighters (album)|eponymous 1995 debut album]] was primarily recorded by frontman [[Dave Grohl]] and producer Barrett Jones as a [[demo (music)|demo]]. After the debut became an international success, Grohl recruited guitarist [[Pat Smear]], bassist [[Nate Mendel]], and drummer [[William Goldsmith]] to form the band's full lineup. The group convened in the fall of 1996 for pre-production on a second album, and brought in [[Gil Norton]] as producer to establish a [[pop music|pop]] sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, contrary to music press predictions that it would be another [[grunge]] offshoot.\n\nPrimarily inspired by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, ''The Colour and the Shape'' is more lyrically introspective and musically developed than the Foo Fighters' debut. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between uptempo tracks and ballads to reflect conflicting emotions. Early sessions at the Bear Creek studio in Washington went poorly and the band discarded most of those recordings. The band regrouped without Goldsmith in early 1997 to record at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings studio, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material had been re-recorded, and he left the band shortly thereafter.\n\nThe singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", and \"[[My Hero (Foo Fighters song)|My Hero]]\" peaked within the top ten of US rock radio charts, and the album charted at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album was also a commercial success on an international level, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics deemed the album a significant American rock release of its era, and in retrospective assessments it continues to be viewed as a seminal modern rock album. It was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] [[40th Grammy Awards|in 1998]] for [[Best Rock Album]]. ''The Colour and the Shape'' remains the Foo Fighters' biggest seller in the U.S., having sold more than two million copies according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]. The album was [[remastered]] and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks for its tenth anniversary.\n\n==Background==\nThe album was the debut of Foo Fighters as a full band. On [[Foo Fighters (album)|the first album]] under the Foo Fighters name, frontman [[Dave Grohl]] had performed and recorded all of the parts by himself, with the exception of one guitar part played by [[Greg Dulli]]. The band's original lineup assembled for their exhaustive touring schedule throughout 1995 and 1996, during which the band became an international sensation on the strength of singles \"[[This Is a Call]]\", \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\". Although the music press generally speculated the band's sophomore record would showcase [[grunge]]-inspired [[garage rock]], the band's intention was to make a more straightforward rock record.<ref name=\"access97\"/> The deal the band struck with [[Capitol Records]] afforded them a large degree of creative control over the band's true \"debut.\"<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> The songs on the record were composed during [[soundcheck]]s during their extensive touring over the previous eighteen months.<ref name=story/> Mendel said \"the germ of every song is Dave's,\" with the frontman providing a riff and a basic song structure.

Victoria Segal at the UK-based ''[[Melody Maker]]'' viewed ''The Colour and the Shape'' as a significant American rock release, writing that it was \"a great rock album at a time when great rock albums are viewed with increasing suspicion.\"<ref name=mm/> Segal's review described the album as leagues ahead of other post-grunge acts: \"The first album might have been a collection of loveable songs, but lacked the sheer visceral attack that thrills this time round,\" Segal wrote, calling it \"[a]n attack that would have{{nbsp}}[\u2026] almost any other US rock band biting their nails in anguish and embarrassment.\"<ref name=mm/>\n\nChristina Kelly of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' was largely positive, although she singled out Norton's production as distracting: \"''Colour'' has a big, radio-ready, modern-rock sound. Some might even call the album overproduced: On the ballads, the vocals are overprocessed and fake sounding.\"<ref name=RS/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the band's growth, but criticized the sound, which journalist [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] described as \"like much current alt-rock: been there, grunged that.\"<ref name=ew/> In contrast, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] described that production as revolutionary: \"everything here wound up defining the sound of [[post-grunge]] modern rock, and it remains as perhaps the best example of its kind.\"<ref name=allmusic/> In his review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] said the music was routine but elevated by Grohl's \"marital breakup content/concept,\" which allowed him to \"fully inhabit the music that meant so much to him and millions of other Kurt Cobain fans.\"<ref name=\"Christgau\"/> Ryan Schreiber of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was less favorable, rating the album 3.4 out of 10 and calling the music \"sorely dated.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schreiber|first1=Ryan|title=Foo Fighters: The Colour & The Shape: Pitchfork Review|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/f/foo-fighters/colour-and-the-shape.shtml|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=21 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030219043918/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/f/foo-fighters/colour-and-the-shape.shtml|archivedate=19 February 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFour years after Schreiber's 2003 review, ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s Stuart Berman gave the tenth anniversary re-release a mildly more favorable review. Scoring the release a 5.8 out of 10, he stated, \"''The Colour and the Shape'' presented a true picture of the kind of group Grohl wanted to be in, had he not been sidetracked by the job of drumming for the biggest American rock band of the early 1990s [...] that band would turn out to be much more formulaically mall-punk than the Foos' torn 'n' frayed debut suggested.\"<ref name=\"berman\">{{cite web |last1=Berman |first1=Stuart |title=The Colour and the Shape [10th Anniversary Special Edition] |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition/ |website=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=July 3, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530214709/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition// |archivedate=May 30, 2019 |date=August 1, 2007}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the re-release with the opposite opinion, citing the self titled record's single \"I'll Stick Around\" as an example of \"Grohl's strikingly non-aggressive (read: bland) vocal style\" from the 1995 album; he then described \"Monkey Wrench\" as proof that Grohl \"knew how to rock out\" by comparison.<ref name=\"popmatters-2007\">{{cite web |last1=Schiller |first1=Mike |title=Foo Fighters: The Colour and the Shape |url=https://www.popmatters.com/foo-fighters-the-colour-and-the-shape-2496216428.html |website=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=July 3, 2019|date=August 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial performance===\n''The Colour and the Shape'' peaked at number 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], up from a peak of 23 for the 1995 self-titled debut.<ref name=\"US-albums\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=foo fighters|chart=Billboard 200}} | title=Foo Fighters Album & Song Chart History: Billboard 200 | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> It also managed to reach the top ten in Australia,<ref name=\"AUS-albums\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=australian-charts.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=foo fighters|chart=Canadian Albums}} | title=Foo Fighters Album & Song Chart History: Canadian Albums | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Greece,<ref name=\"IFPI-ireland\" /> Ireland,<ref name=\"IFPI-ireland\" /> New Zealand,<ref name=\"NZ\">{{cite web|url=https://charts.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=charts.nz|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Sweden,<ref name=\"SWE\">{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"UK-albums\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27860/foo-fighters/|title=Foo Fighters|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The album has also been certified Platinum in the United States,<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> Australia,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.

It marked the official debut of the Foo Fighters as a band, as their [[Foo Fighters (album)|eponymous 1995 debut album]] was primarily recorded by frontman [[Dave Grohl]] and producer Barrett Jones as a [[demo (music)|demo]]. After the debut became an international success, Grohl recruited guitarist [[Pat Smear]], bassist [[Nate Mendel]], and drummer [[William Goldsmith]] to form the band's full lineup. The group convened in the fall of 1996 for pre-production on a second album, and brought in [[Gil Norton]] as producer to establish a [[pop music|pop]] sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, contrary to music press predictions that it would be another [[grunge]] offshoot.\n\nPrimarily inspired by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, ''The Colour and the Shape'' is more lyrically introspective and musically developed than the Foo Fighters' debut. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between uptempo tracks and ballads to reflect conflicting emotions. Early sessions at the Bear Creek studio in Washington went poorly and the band discarded most of those recordings. The band regrouped without Goldsmith in early 1997 to record at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings studio, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material had been re-recorded, and he left the band shortly thereafter.\n\nThe singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", and \"[[My Hero (Foo Fighters song)|My Hero]]\" peaked within the top ten of US rock radio charts, and the album charted at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album was also a commercial success on an international level, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics deemed the album a significant American rock release of its era, and in retrospective assessments it continues to be viewed as a seminal modern rock album. It was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] [[40th Grammy Awards|in 1998]] for [[Best Rock Album]]. ''The Colour and the Shape'' remains the Foo Fighters' biggest seller in the U.S., having sold more than two million copies according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]. The album was [[remastered]] and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks for its tenth anniversary.\n\n==Background==\nThe album was the debut of Foo Fighters as a full band. On [[Foo Fighters (album)|the first album]] under the Foo Fighters name, frontman [[Dave Grohl]] had performed and recorded all of the parts by himself, with the exception of one guitar part played by [[Greg Dulli]]. The band's original lineup assembled for their exhaustive touring schedule throughout 1995 and 1996, during which the band became an international sensation on the strength of singles \"[[This Is a Call]]\", \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\". Although the music press generally speculated the band's sophomore record would showcase [[grunge]]-inspired [[garage rock]], the band's intention was to make a more straightforward rock record.<ref name=\"access97\"/> The deal the band struck with [[Capitol Records]] afforded them a large degree of creative control over the band's true \"debut.\"<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> The songs on the record were composed during [[soundcheck]]s during their extensive touring over the previous eighteen months.<ref name=story/> Mendel said \"the germ of every song is Dave's,\" with the frontman providing a riff and a basic song structure. The band would then [[jam session|jam]] and each member would contribute to some aspect of the song.<ref name=id>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|title=Foo Fighters At Peace With Group Identity; Hollywood Won't Get Whalley|journal=Billboard|author=Newman, Melina|date=1997-05-17}}</ref>\n\nGrohl recruited producer [[Gil Norton]] to provide additional pop polish to the material. He especially wanted to hear guitar overdubs and harmonies with significant clarity.<ref name=\"access97\"/> Grohl said he admired Norton for his earlier work with the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and his ability to \"distill a coherent pop song out of all [the Pixies'] multi-layered weirdness.\"<ref name=\"linernotes\">{{cite AV media notes | title=The Colour and the Shape (Bonus Tracks) | year=2007 | others=[[Foo Fighters]] | type=liner notes | publisher=Roswell/RCA/Legacy | location=[[United States|US]] | id=88697 09183 2}}</ref> Norton was highly demanding of the band's performance, prompting bassist [[Nate Mendel]] to practice and improve his musical skill.<ref name=back/> Grohl said \"it was frustrating and it was hard and it was long, but at the end of the day you listened back to what you'd done and you understood why you had to do it one million times.\"<ref name=bill>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Capitol Stresses Group 'Shape' of the Foo Fighters|journal=Billboard|author=Newman, Melina|date=1997-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |salign=center|quote=While recording this record two marriages fell apart, we lost a drummer, someone nearly went to jail, and we discovered late in the day that record making is hellishly expensive and best done with a budget prepared beforehand.|source=\u2013 [[Nate Mendel]], May 2007<ref name=\"linernotes\"/>|align=right|width=25em}}\n''The Colour and the Shape'' was recorded over the period of two months, primarily at Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood from January to February 1997.<ref name=\"access97\"/> The band spent two weeks in pre-production the previous autumn, rehearsing the tracks and changing arrangements.<ref name=\"access97\"/> Norton had his greatest impact during pre-production, during which he spent days with Grohl in his hotel room \"stripping the songs back to their absolute basics.\"<ref name=story>{{cite book|year=2006|title=The Dave Grohl Story|first=Jeff|last=Apter|publisher=Music Sales Group|ISBN=978-0-85712-021-2|page=304}}</ref> His role in production taught the band the importance of self-editing and gave them confidence to see \"the larger picture in a song.\"<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> Afterward, the band set off for Bear Creek Studios in [[Woodinville, Washington]], where the first recording sessions for ''The Colour and the Shape'' began on November 18, 1996.<ref name=\"story\"/> Mendel described Bear Creek as \"a converted barn with a salmon stream running through it\".<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> The studio was located on a farm and, for the duration of these sessions, the band lived in a cabin adjacent to the studio.<ref name=\"linernotes\"/>\n\nGrohl, who described the sessions at Bear Creek as a \"bad experience,\" decided to scrap nearly all of the recorded tracks.<ref name=\"linernotes\"/><ref name=\"kerrang\"/> The band took a break for the holidays, during which Grohl returned to Virginia and wrote several new songs.

Grohl's drumming started with only \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", as Grohl and Norton felt the drums on that song needed more work, but by the end of the sessions recordings of Goldsmith's drumming remained on only two tracks, \"Doll\" and \"Up in Arms\".<ref name=apter306>Apter, 2006. p. 306</ref> According to Grohl, Goldsmith's drumming had good moments, but his performances mostly did not fit what Grohl had conceived for the drum track, so the frontman decided to redo them himself. Goldsmith even asked if he should go to Los Angeles, but Grohl declined and said he was only performing [[overdub]]s. Eventually, Mendel told Goldsmith the situation.

Scoring the release a 5.8 out of 10, he stated, \"''The Colour and the Shape'' presented a true picture of the kind of group Grohl wanted to be in, had he not been sidetracked by the job of drumming for the biggest American rock band of the early 1990s [...] that band would turn out to be much more formulaically mall-punk than the Foos' torn 'n' frayed debut suggested.\"<ref name=\"berman\">{{cite web |last1=Berman |first1=Stuart |title=The Colour and the Shape [10th Anniversary Special Edition] |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition/ |website=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=July 3, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530214709/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition// |archivedate=May 30, 2019 |date=August 1, 2007}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the re-release with the opposite opinion, citing the self titled record's single \"I'll Stick Around\" as an example of \"Grohl's strikingly non-aggressive (read: bland) vocal style\" from the 1995 album; he then described \"Monkey Wrench\" as proof that Grohl \"knew how to rock out\" by comparison.<ref name=\"popmatters-2007\">{{cite web |last1=Schiller |first1=Mike |title=Foo Fighters: The Colour and the Shape |url=https://www.popmatters.com/foo-fighters-the-colour-and-the-shape-2496216428.html |website=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=July 3, 2019|date=August 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial performance===\n''The Colour and the Shape'' peaked at number 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], up from a peak of 23 for the 1995 self-titled debut.<ref name=\"US-albums\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=foo fighters|chart=Billboard 200}} | title=Foo Fighters Album & Song Chart History: Billboard 200 | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> It also managed to reach the top ten in Australia,<ref name=\"AUS-albums\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=australian-charts.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=foo fighters|chart=Canadian Albums}} | title=Foo Fighters Album & Song Chart History: Canadian Albums | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Greece,<ref name=\"IFPI-ireland\" /> Ireland,<ref name=\"IFPI-ireland\" /> New Zealand,<ref name=\"NZ\">{{cite web|url=https://charts.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=charts.nz|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> Sweden,<ref name=\"SWE\">{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Foo+Fighters|title=Discography Foo Fighters|publisher=Hung Medien|work=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}</ref> and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"UK-albums\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27860/foo-fighters/|title=Foo Fighters|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The album has also been certified Platinum in the United States,<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> Australia,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.
