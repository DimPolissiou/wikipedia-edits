The main method of applying the extensions is by using a cyanoacrylate adhesive to apply the extension(s) to the natural lash 1-2 mm from the base of the natural eyelash, never making contact with the eyelid.  \n\n==History==\nIn 1879, James D.

As a result, how justices interpret the constitution, and the ways in which they approach this task has a political aspect. Terms describing types of judicial interpretation can be ambiguous; for example, the term ''judicial conservatism'' can vary in meaning depending on what is trying to be \"conserved\". One can look at judicial interpretation along a continuum from [[judicial restraint]] to [[judicial activism]], with different viewpoints along the continuum.\n\n==Basis for judicial interpretation==\n\nIn the [[United States]], there are different ways to do judicial interpretation:\n\n* ''Balancing'' happens when judges weigh one set of interests or rights against an opposing set, typically used to make rulings in [[First Amendment to the Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. For example, cases involving [[freedom of speech]] sometimes require justices to make a distinction between legally permissible speech and speech that can be restricted or banned for, say, reasons of safety, and the task then is for justices to balance these conflicting claims. The balancing approach was criticized by Supreme Court justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] who argued that the Constitution gives no guidance about how to weigh or measure divergent interests.<ref name=tws3R18fs>{{cite book\n |author= John E.

This is an important issue in some [[common law jurisdictions]] such as the [[Law of the United States|United States]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]] and [[Law of Canada|Canada]], because the [[Supreme court|supreme courts]] of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called [[judicial review]]. \n\nFor example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has decided such topics as the legality of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as in the [[Dred Scott decision|''Dred Scott'' decision]], and [[desegregation]] as in the ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'' decision, and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] as in the ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' decision. As a result, how justices interpret the constitution, and the ways in which they approach this task has a political aspect. Terms describing types of judicial interpretation can be ambiguous; for example, the term ''judicial conservatism'' can vary in meaning depending on what is trying to be \"conserved\". One can look at judicial interpretation along a continuum from [[judicial restraint]] to [[judicial activism]], with different viewpoints along the continuum.\n\n==Basis for judicial interpretation==\n\nIn the [[United States]], there are different ways to do judicial interpretation:\n\n* ''Balancing'' happens when judges weigh one set of interests or rights against an opposing set, typically used to make rulings in [[First Amendment to the Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. For example, cases involving [[freedom of speech]] sometimes require justices to make a distinction between legally permissible speech and speech that can be restricted or banned for, say, reasons of safety, and the task then is for justices to balance these conflicting claims. The balancing approach was criticized by Supreme Court justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] who argued that the Constitution gives no guidance about how to weigh or measure divergent interests.<ref name=tws3R18fs>{{cite book\n |author= John E.

The ring was part of a [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|tradition of stone circle construction]] that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and [[Brittany]] during the [[Neolithic British Isles|Late Neolithic]] and Early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], over a period between 3300 and 900&nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]]. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although some [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] speculate that the stones represented [[supernatural]] entities for the circle's builders. Paul is a patti poori.\n\nA double concentric circle consisting of [[sarsen]] [[megalith]]s, Fir Clump Stone Circle was oval-shaped. The outer ring measured {{convert|107|m|ft}} by {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} in diameter; the inner ring was {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} by {{convert|73.7|m|ft}}. It was one of at least seven stone circles that are known to have been erected in the area south of [[Swindon]] in northern Wiltshire. Around the 1860s, the megaliths in Fir Clump Stone Circle were levelled and in the 1890s the antiquarian A. D. Passmore observed that the circle was no longer visible. Some of the fallen megaliths were rediscovered in 1965 by the archaeologist Richard Reiss, who described and measured the monument. In 1969, these stones were removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]].\n\n==Context==\nWhile the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] in the fourth and third millennia&nbsp;BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By 3000&nbsp;BCE, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es that had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include earthen [[henge]]s, [[timber circles]], and stone circles.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91\u201394}} Stone circles exist in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} The tradition of their construction may have lasted 2,400&nbsp;years, from 3300 to 900&nbsp;BCE, the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300&nbsp;BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\nThese stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that this suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologist [[Mike Parker Pearson]] argues that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=97\u201398}} Other archaeologists have proposed that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}\n\nStone circles were erected in the area of modern Wiltshire, the best known of which are [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]]. All of the other examples are ruined, and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these destroyed examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire circles were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}}\nIn the area south of [[Swindon]], as many as seven possible stone circles are reported as having existed:{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} Fir Clump Stone Circle, [[Swindon Old Church Stone Circle]], [[Broome Stone Circle]], [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]], [[Coate Reservoir Stone Circle]], [[Hodson Stone Circle]], and [[Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle]]. Often, these circles were only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} for instance, Fir Clump Stone Circle was a mile south of the Broome Stone Circle.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} All of these northern Wiltshire circles have been destroyed, although the vestiges of one survive:{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} the stones at the Day House Lane Stone Circle in [[Bishops Cannings|Coate]] remain, albeit in a fallen state.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}}\n\n==Description==\nFir Clump Stone Circle consisted of coarse [[sarsen]] megaliths,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} arranged as a double [[concentric objects|concentric]] circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2003|1p=222|2a1=Field|2a2=McOmish|2y=2017|2p=79}} The archaeologists David Field and David McOmish noted that the circle appeared to be \"slightly oval in outline\".{{sfn|Field|McOmish|2017|p=79}} The outer ring, which was found to be fragmentary,{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} measured {{convert|107|m|ft}} by {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} in diameter.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}}{{efn|In his 2000 book ''The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany'', Burl stated that the circle had measured {{convert|115|m|ft}} by {{convert|94|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} He later retracted this as an error based on his calculations drawn from a photocopy of the original site plan provided to him by the [[Historic England Archive|National Monuments Record]].{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} }} The inner ring measured {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} by {{convert|73.7|m|ft}} and was flattened on the northern side.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}}\n\nAround {{convert|125|m|ft}} to the west of the circle was a stone row measuring {{convert|102|m|ft}} in length that was aligned on a north/north-west to south/south-east axis.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} The fact that Fir Clump Stone Circle was double concentric mirrors the Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle, which was similarly found to consist of two concentric rings;{{sfn|Field|McOmish|2017|p=79}} it is also possible that the Coate Reservoir Stone Circle consisted of a double circle.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=200}}\n\n==Discovery and destruction==\n[[File:M4 motorway near Swindon, looking southeast (geograph 2018430).jpg|thumb|right|The M4 motorway with Burderop Wood on the right-hand side; the stone circle stood nearby]]\nIn the late nineteenth century, the [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] A. D. Passmore wrote two notebooks in which he discussed archaeological sites in Wiltshire. He recorded a local tradition that there had been a large stone circle near the railway bridge outside [[Old Town, Swindon|Swindon Old Town]] and the old [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] road to Ladder Hill.{{sfn|Burl|2004|pp=204\u2013205}} He also recorded that the circle had been broken up about thirty years prior and that as such he did not know how many stones had been part of the circle. He added that many small pieces of sarsen could be found at the circle.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=205}} The contents of Passmore's notebooks and their references to Fir Clump Stone Circle were not published until 2004, after they had been purchased by the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]].{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}}\n\nIn an 1894 article in ''The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine'', Passmore briefly mentioned the presence of \"a number of sarsens, which may or may not have formed part of a circle\", existing at [[Hodson, Wiltshire|Hodson]], which is adjacent to Burderop Wood.{{sfn|Passmore|1894|p=174}} He added that a line of stones appeared to emerge from this putative circle and head in the direction of Coate.{{sfn|Passmore|1894|p=174}} In 2000, Burl listed this description as a reference to the Fir Clump ring,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=413}} although in Passmore's notebooks, published in 2004, the antiquarian differentiated the Fir Clump and Hodson examples as separate circles.{{sfn|Burl|2004|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\nFir Clump Stone Circle was rediscovered in 1965 by the borough surveyor Richard Reiss, who noted that at the time the sarsen stones were fallen.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Field|2a2=McOmish|2y=2017|2p=78}} He produced a plan of the site as it then existed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} In 1969, these stones were removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}} Burl called this destruction \"a megalithic tragedy\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |url=https://archive.org/details/stonecirclesofbr0000burl |url-access=registration |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-08347-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2003 |title=Fir Clump Stone Circle \u2013 A Correction |journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine |volume=96 |page=222 |url=https://archive.org/details/wiltshirearchaeo9620wilt/page/222 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2004 |title=A.

In 1969, these stones were removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]].\n\n==Context==\nWhile the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] in the fourth and third millennia&nbsp;BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By 3000&nbsp;BCE, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es that had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include earthen [[henge]]s, [[timber circles]], and stone circles.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91\u201394}} Stone circles exist in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} The tradition of their construction may have lasted 2,400&nbsp;years, from 3300 to 900&nbsp;BCE, the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300&nbsp;BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}\n\nThese stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that this suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologist [[Mike Parker Pearson]] argues that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=97\u201398}} Other archaeologists have proposed that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}\n\nStone circles were erected in the area of modern Wiltshire, the best known of which are [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]]. All of the other examples are ruined, and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these destroyed examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire circles were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}}\nIn the area south of [[Swindon]], as many as seven possible stone circles are reported as having existed:{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} Fir Clump Stone Circle, [[Swindon Old Church Stone Circle]], [[Broome Stone Circle]], [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]], [[Coate Reservoir Stone Circle]], [[Hodson Stone Circle]], and [[Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle]]. Often, these circles were only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} for instance, Fir Clump Stone Circle was a mile south of the Broome Stone Circle.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} All of these northern Wiltshire circles have been destroyed, although the vestiges of one survive:{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} the stones at the Day House Lane Stone Circle in [[Bishops Cannings|Coate]] remain, albeit in a fallen state.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}}\n\n==Description==\nFir Clump Stone Circle consisted of coarse [[sarsen]] megaliths,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} arranged as a double [[concentric objects|concentric]] circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2003|1p=222|2a1=Field|2a2=McOmish|2y=2017|2p=79}} The archaeologists David Field and David McOmish noted that the circle appeared to be \"slightly oval in outline\".{{sfn|Field|McOmish|2017|p=79}} The outer ring, which was found to be fragmentary,{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} measured {{convert|107|m|ft}} by {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} in diameter.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}}{{efn|In his 2000 book ''The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany'', Burl stated that the circle had measured {{convert|115|m|ft}} by {{convert|94|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} He later retracted this as an error based on his calculations drawn from a photocopy of the original site plan provided to him by the [[Historic England Archive|National Monuments Record]].{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} }} The inner ring measured {{convert|86.5|m|ft}} by {{convert|73.7|m|ft}} and was flattened on the northern side.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}}\n\nAround {{convert|125|m|ft}} to the west of the circle was a stone row measuring {{convert|102|m|ft}} in length that was aligned on a north/north-west to south/south-east axis.{{sfn|Burl|2003|p=222}} The fact that Fir Clump Stone Circle was double concentric mirrors the Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle, which was similarly found to consist of two concentric rings;{{sfn|Field|McOmish|2017|p=79}} it is also possible that the Coate Reservoir Stone Circle consisted of a double circle.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=200}}\n\n==Discovery and destruction==\n[[File:M4 motorway near Swindon, looking southeast (geograph 2018430).jpg|thumb|right|The M4 motorway with Burderop Wood on the right-hand side; the stone circle stood nearby]]\nIn the late nineteenth century, the [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] A. D. Passmore wrote two notebooks in which he discussed archaeological sites in Wiltshire. He recorded a local tradition that there had been a large stone circle near the railway bridge outside [[Old Town, Swindon|Swindon Old Town]] and the old [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] road to Ladder Hill.{{sfn|Burl|2004|pp=204\u2013205}} He also recorded that the circle had been broken up about thirty years prior and that as such he did not know how many stones had been part of the circle. He added that many small pieces of sarsen could be found at the circle.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=205}} The contents of Passmore's notebooks and their references to Fir Clump Stone Circle were not published until 2004, after they had been purchased by the [[Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society]].{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}}\n\nIn an 1894 article in ''The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine'', Passmore briefly mentioned the presence of \"a number of sarsens, which may or may not have formed part of a circle\", existing at [[Hodson, Wiltshire|Hodson]], which is adjacent to Burderop Wood.{{sfn|Passmore|1894|p=174}} He added that a line of stones appeared to emerge from this putative circle and head in the direction of Coate.{{sfn|Passmore|1894|p=174}} In 2000, Burl listed this description as a reference to the Fir Clump ring,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=413}} although in Passmore's notebooks, published in 2004, the antiquarian differentiated the Fir Clump and Hodson examples as separate circles.{{sfn|Burl|2004|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\nFir Clump Stone Circle was rediscovered in 1965 by the borough surveyor Richard Reiss, who noted that at the time the sarsen stones were fallen.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Field|2a2=McOmish|2y=2017|2p=78}} He produced a plan of the site as it then existed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}} In 1969, these stones were removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}} Burl called this destruction \"a megalithic tragedy\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=311}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |url=https://archive.org/details/stonecirclesofbr0000burl |url-access=registration |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-08347-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2003 |title=Fir Clump Stone Circle \u2013 A Correction |journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine |volume=96 |page=222 |url=https://archive.org/details/wiltshirearchaeo9620wilt/page/222 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |author-link=Aubrey Burl |year=2004 |title=A.

It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1694 and later became the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. It inherited the unique distinction in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its headdress as well as the front, a tradition that originated with the 28th Regiment after it fought in two ranks back to back at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two [[Regular army|regular]], two [[Militia (Great Britain)|militia]] and two [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer]] battalions, and saw its first action during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], the regiment's four auxiliary battalions were converted to three [[Territorial Force]] battalions and a [[Special Reserve]] battalion, and a further 18 battalions were added to the regiment's establishment during the war. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing a total of 8,100 men killed and winning 72 different [[battle honour]]s. Four awards of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. The wartime battalions were disbanded as the war ended, and just before the [[Second World War]], two of the territorial battalions were re-purposed and ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the remaining territorial battalion was duplicated, and another five battalions were raised on the outbreak of war, though most of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war progressed. Four battalions saw active service under the regiment's colours during the war. The 2nd and 5th Battalions both fought in the [[Battle of France]] and, after being lost almost in its entirety during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], the re-formed 2nd Battalion landed at [[Gold Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] and fought in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaign in North-West Europe. The 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], and the 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of Japanese forces during the [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, the hostilities-only battalions were disbanded and the 1st and 2nd Battalions were [[wikt:amalgamated|amalgamated]], leaving the regiment with one regular and one [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] battalion. It achieved fame during the [[Korean War]] when the 1st Battalion held out for three nights against overwhelming odds during the [[Battle of the Imjin River]]. The stand, described by the commander of the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea at the time as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\", prevented the encirclement of other United Nations forces, for which the regiment was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and earned the nickname ''The Glorious Glosters''. Two men serving with the regiment were awarded the VC for their actions in the battle. In the latter half of the 20th century, the regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion and completed tours of duty around the world, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, as well as in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]]. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which carried more battle honours on its [[Military colours, standards and guidons|colours]] than any other regiment of the line, was merged with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment inherited the back badge, and when it too was merged in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor, [[The Rifles]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Soldier of 28th regiment 1742.jpg|thumb|upright|Uniform of the 28th c.1742 with its yellow [[Facing colour|facings]]]]\n\nThe Gloucestershire Regiment traced its roots to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, raised in 1694 in Portsmouth,<ref>Daniell p. 3</ref> which first saw action in 1705 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 12</ref> Having been commanded by, and therefore named after, a succession of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and fought under this name during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 18</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|title=Bragg\u2019s Regiment and the 28th Foot&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230907/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another predecessor, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was formed in 1758 when the British Army was expanded during the [[Seven Years' War]].

For the first time the county of [[Gloucestershire]] was associated with both the 28th and 61st Regiments, which were renamed as the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|title=North and South Gloucestershire&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107013144/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Both regiments began to recruit from the county, and it was in Gloucester in December 1782 that the 61st Regiment was presented with new colours to replace those lost during the [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|Franco-Spanish invasion of Minorca]] earlier that year.<ref>Daniell p. 54</ref>\n\nIn March 1801, the 28th Regiment formed part of the British expeditionary force that landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to oppose [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] Army of the East. On 21&nbsp;March, during the [[Battle of Alexandria]], French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. With the men still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given for the rear rank to turn about, and standing thus in two ranks back to back, the regiment held the line. To commemorate this action, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress, a unique distinction in the British Army that was officially sanctioned in 1830.<ref>Daniell pp. 69\u201375</ref><ref name=Grazebrook>Grazebrook pp. 112\u2013113</ref>{{efn|The origins of the back badge and its initial form are not known; other than the honour \"Egypt\", awarded to all units, there is no record of a special badge being officially granted. An officer who served with the regiment between 1805 and 1807 wrote that the regiment \"acquired the emblem of the double front.\" In 1815, a staff officer witnessed the regiment marching out to Quatre Bras \"having their number both in front and rear of their low caps\u2014a memorial of Egypt.\" The first record of official recognition appears in an 1830 letter from the [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], which states that \"it was never the intention to deprive the 28th Regiment of any badge of honour they may have acquired by their distinguished service in Egypt, and that there will be no objection to their retaining the plate they have been accustomed to wear on the back of their caps since that service...\" This was officially confirmed in another letter dated 1843. It is possible, therefore, that the back badge was introduced by the regiment shortly after the Battle of Alexandria, but not officially sanctioned until 1830.<ref name=Grazebrook />}} The 61st Regiment also deployed to Egypt and, although arriving too late to play an active part, was, like the 28th Regiment, awarded the battle honour \"Egypt\" and the right to display the Sphinx on its colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1801/05/20/the-battle-of-alexandria/|title=The Battle of Alexandria&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230643/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1801/05/20/the-battle-of-alexandria/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Butler Lady Quatre Bras 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''[[The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras]]'']]\nDuring the 19th century, relatively uneventful postings at home and abroad were punctuated with periods of active service.

The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and added \"Alma\", \"Inkerman\" and \"Sevastopol\" to its legacy.<ref>Daniell ch.XIII\u2013XIV</ref>\n\nAnother thread that would be woven into the story of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the civilian administered auxiliary forces which supported the army in times of need. In the mid-18th century, county [[Militia (Great Britain)|militias]] were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and these were organised in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at [[Cecily Hill Barracks|Cirencester]].<ref>Daniell p. 26</ref> In 1859, county-based [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer rifle corps]] were raised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.<ref>Daniell pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Colours in Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|The regimental colours in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]\nIn 1872, the [[Cardwell Reforms]] began the process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line infantry regiments, a process that was completed by the [[Childers Reforms]] nine years later. As a result, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at [[Horfield Barracks]] in Bristol.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24992|pages=3300\u20133301|date=1 July 1881}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 186\u2013187.

It was a privilege that the 2nd Battalion did not want, but it was made palatable to the former 61st Regiment by replacing the number 28 with the Sphinx, a battle honour awarded to both predecessor regiments.<ref name=\"formation\"/> Although both battalions were forced to give up their individual [[facing colour]]s on their uniforms&nbsp;\u2013 yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st Regiment&nbsp;\u2013 when the government imposed a standard white across all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never accepted this change for their [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]]. Both battalions retained their former colours until 1929, when a compromise primrose yellow was finally chosen and a new regimental colour subsequently presented.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 188</ref>\n\nThe two battalions continued to refer to themselves by their former regimental numbers until they were merged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment became a single-battalion regiment. The 1st Battalion celebrated the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the anniversary of the Battle of Alexandria annually. The 2nd Battalion, on the other hand, held games followed by a dinner and a ball on the anniversary of the 61st Regiment's victory at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwallah]] on 13 January 1849 when overseas, or on the anniversary of that regiment's victory at [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]] on 22 July 1812 when at home.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 189</ref>\n\nThe new regiment acquired its march, ''The Kinnegad Slashers'', and its official nickname, ''Slashers'', from the 28th Regiment. The name arose from an incident in 1764, when members of the regiment allegedly slashed off part of the ear of a Montreal magistrate who had been harassing soldiers stationed in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was also sometimes referred to as ''The Old Braggs'', from Colonel [[Philip Bragg]], who commanded the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two other nicknames associated with the new regiment were inherited from the 61st Regiment; ''The Flowers of Toulouse'', from the scarlet uniforms of that regiment's many dead in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]], and ''The Silver-Tailed Dandies'', from the silver decorations on the longer-than-normal coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform.<ref>Daniell pp. 17, 41\u201342, 118, 178</ref>\n\n==Second Boer War==\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.

The two battalions alternated between postings at home and overseas, mostly in India, but their first action came in 1899 during the [[Second Boer War]]. Deployed to Ladysmith, the 1st Battalion was part of a column sent out on 24&nbsp;October to cover the withdrawal of a brigade after the [[Battle of Talana Hill]]. When the column came under fire near Rietfontein, the battalion was detached and ordered forward, but the order was ambiguous and the battalion advanced too far. The troops were caught in the open for several hours before they were able to extricate themselves at the cost of five men killed, including the battalion commander, and 58 wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 190\u2013191</ref>\n\nFive days later, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion were part of a small force tasked with seizing Nicholson's Nek, a pass some {{convert|6|mi|km|-1}} north of Ladysmith, during the [[Battle of Ladysmith]]. The troops moved out on the night of 29&nbsp;October with the intention to be in position before the main battle started, but they left too late to reach their objective before daybreak. As they took up an alternative position on the nearby Tchrengula Hill the pack-mules bolted, taking most of the heavy weaponry and ammunition with them. The Boers discovered the incursion at dawn and surrounded the position, and although the British held out for several hours they were forced to surrender at 12:30. The battalion lost 38 killed and 115 wounded, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Pretoria.<ref>Daniell pp. 191\u2013194</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|title=The Siege of Ladysmith&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013173326/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhile the remainder of the 1st Battalion helped in the defence of Ladysmith (the city was eventually [[relief of Ladysmith|relieved]] on 1&nbsp;March), the 2nd Battalion deployed to South Africa, arriving in January 1900. The battalion fought in the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], a nine-day battle which ended on 27&nbsp;February with the capture of the Boer general [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] and his force of some 4,000 men. On 15&nbsp;March, the battalion entered the Boer city of Bloemfontein, where it remained on garrison duties until 1904. The 1st Battalion, re-united when its POWs were liberated after the capture of Pretoria on 5&nbsp;July, was posted in August 1900 to Ceylon, where it remained until 1903 guarding Boer prisoners of war.<ref>Daniell pp. 194\u2013199, 203</ref>\n\nSome of the regiment's auxiliary battalions, which in 1900 were increased in number by the formation of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion,<ref name=\"Daniell p. 199\">Daniell p. 199</ref> also played a role in the war.

The division's 58th Brigade had captured the western half of the village on 2&nbsp;July, and the 8th Battalion [[North Staffordshire Regiment]] and 10th Battalion [[Worcestershire Regiment]], both of the 57th Brigade, assisted in the capture of the rest of the village the next day. A German counter-attack regained the eastern half of the village, and the 8th Glosters suffered 302 casualties when it fought alongside the 10th Battalion [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] to help retake it. During the battle, the Glosters' commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], assumed command of all four 57th Brigade battalions when the other three commanding officers became casualties, and for his actions in averting a serious reverse he was awarded the VC. Later the same month, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion made two unsuccessful attacks against the German line east of the village which together cost it 374 casualties, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major [[Lord Alexander Thynne|Lord A.G.

The battalion was next in action on the evening of 21&nbsp;March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive, when the Germans captured Doignies. Unable to recapture the village, the battalion blocked any further enemy progress until the morning of 23&nbsp;March, when German forces broke through on the left and threatened to outflank it. Company A fought to the last man covering the battalion's withdrawal, for which action the company commander, Captain [[Manley Angell James]], was awarded the VC. By the time the 19th Division withdrew to Doullens on 28&nbsp;March the battalion had suffered 323 casualties.<ref>Littlewood pp. 119\u2013121, 185</ref> In April, the battalion fought in three engagements of the Battle of the Lys: the Battles of Messines, Bailleul and First Kemmel. The following month, the 19th Division's parent unit, [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], was transferred to the French Sixth Army. The division was supposed to rest and re-organise in a quiet sector, but on 27&nbsp;May the Germans launched a major attack, ensnaring the 8th Battalion in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne]].

In 1917, the 1st Division was allocated to Operation Hush, and when that was cancelled the 10th battalion moved to the Ypres area. It was disbanded in February 1918 and its men distributed among the regiment's 1st and 8th Battalions and the 13th Entrenching Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 139\u2013141</ref><ref>Westlake p. 137</ref>\n\n====12th Battalion (Bristol's Own)====\n{{main|12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol's Own)}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Somme, July-november 1916 Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Battalion troops move up during the Battle of Morval]]\nThe 12th Battalion was raised in Bristol in August 1914 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee.

The division returned to France in April 1918, occupying positions in the line near Nieppe Forest, and the battalion saw action on 25&nbsp;April and 28&nbsp;June, both times successfully advancing the front line. Its last action came during the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]], where it suffered some 100 casualties on 21&nbsp;August but succeeded in capturing [[Irles]] on 23&nbsp;August. On 6&nbsp;October, the battalion was disbanded and its men distributed among the other units of the 5th Division.<ref>Littlewood pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n====13th Battalion (Forest of Dean)====\nThe 13th Battalion was raised in December 1914 at Malvern by [[Sir Henry Webb, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Webb]] and recruited from the miners of the Forest of Dean, South Wales and the Durham coalfields. In July 1915, it was taken over by the War Office and went to France in March 1916 as divisional pioneers to the [[39th Division (United Kingdom)|39th Division]].<ref name=James /> The battalion saw its first significant action on 30&nbsp;June 1916, during the [[Battle of the Boar's Head]], when it dug communication trenches behind the assaulting troops. On several occasions during the battle the pioneers had to stop digging to defend themselves, and the battalion suffered 71 casualties. It saw action again towards the end of 1916 during operations on the Ancre, including the [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]] and the Battle of the Ancre. In March 1918, the battalion suffered particularly badly in the opening week of the [[German Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], during which it was required to take positions in the line as infantry, and by the time the division was withdrawn on 31&nbsp;March the battalion had sustained 326 casualties. In April, the survivors were allocated to composite infantry battalions and saw their last action on 26&nbsp;April during the Second Battle of Kemmel, part of the Battle of the Lys, after which the battalion was reduced to a training cadre.<ref>Littlewood pp. 159\u2013162</ref>\n\n====14th Battalion (West of England)====\nThe 14th Battalion was a [[Bantam (military)|bantam]] unit of volunteers from Bristol and Birmingham who had previously been rejected for service because of their short height. It was raised in April 1915 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee, adopted by the War Office in June 1915, and departed for France in January 1916 as part of the [[105th Brigade (United Kingdom)|105th Brigade]] in the [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]].<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 167</ref> The battalion went into the line in March, where the men's first task was to raise the height of the [[wikt:fire step|firing step]],<ref>Daniell pp. 225\u2013226</ref> and its first significant action came on 8&nbsp;June, when it conducted a large raid south-east of Neuve Chapelle. In July, following the [[capture of Tr\u00f4nes Wood]] by the 18th Division during the Battle of Bazentin, the battalion moved into the line at the northern end of the wood where, on 19&nbsp;July, it suffered 107 casualties to enemy artillery.<ref>Westlake p. 138</ref> On 21&nbsp;August 1917, while in the line near \u00c9pehy, the Germans attacked one of the battalion's bombing posts. Although his bombing party were driven back, Second-Lieutenant [[Hardy Falconer Parsons]] remained and prevented the enemy from entering the trenches, for which act he was posthumously awarded the VC. The battalion fought in the Action of 22&nbsp;October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw its last action on 4&nbsp;February 1918, when it successfully attacked a fortified farm in the Ypres sector. Seven days later the battalion was disbanded and its men transferred to the 13th Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 167\u2013170</ref>\n\n====18th Battalion====\nThe 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], and decamped to France in August 1918 as part of the [[49th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division|16th Division]]. It went into action on 11&nbsp;September, when it successfully assaulted the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its last action on 18&nbsp;September, when a German attack drove A Company from its forward posts. The battalion was disbanded in June 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Fifth Gloucester Gazette===\n[[File:Lieutenant FW Harvey DCM.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant F. W.

The first issue appeared on 12&nbsp;April 1915 and foreshadowed more famous trench journals such as ''[[The Wipers Times]]''. It ran for 25 issues, the last of which appeared in January 1919.

The 1st Battalion completed tours of duty in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican [[Se\u00e1n Moylan]], and Germany, which counted as a home posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In 1928, the 2nd Battalion returned to the UK and the 1st Battalion was posted overseas, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938.<ref>Daniell pp. 232\u2013235</ref> Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937.<ref>Daniell p. 237</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|title=Egypt and Preparation for War|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163707/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|archive-date=2017-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, the 5th Battalion became the regiment's sole territorial unit when the 4th Battalion was converted to the [[66th (Gloucesters) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (RA), and the 6th Battalion converted to the [[44th Royal Tank Regiment|44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Daniell p. 239</ref> On the eve of the [[Second World War]], the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and the 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line duplicate of the 5th Battalion.<ref>Daniell p. 425</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:\n* 1st Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 stationed around Rangoon in Burma<ref>Daniell p. 265</ref>\n* 2nd Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]] in the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]<ref>Joslen p. 246</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#5th_Gloucesters|5th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 144th Infantry Brigade in the 48th Division<ref>Joslen p. 329</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#7th_Gloucesters|7th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 183rd Infantry Brigade in the 61st Division<ref>Joslen p. 376</ref>\n\n===Battle of France===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=Completely surrounded, with our lack of weapons there was only one thing to do.

This brought it alongside the 5th Battalion in the division's 144th Brigade, which had arrived in France on 15&nbsp;January 1940.<ref>Daniell pp. 242\u2013244</ref> In May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], the German [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|breakthrough at Sedan]] precipitated a retreat to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The 5th Battalion marched {{convert|95|mi|km|-1}} in 83 hours with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in a matter of minutes to an airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20&nbsp;May, when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) for two days before the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] resumed its retreat. On 25&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of Somer Force. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the [[Battle of Dunkirk|outer perimeter around Dunkirk]]. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27&nbsp;May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29&nbsp;May, but few made it to Dunkirk. The 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties at Cassel, 484 of them POWs.<ref>Daniell pp. 251\u2013259</ref> Meanwhile, the 5th Battalion was given a similar task at the villages of Arneke and Ledringhem, some {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26&nbsp;May, and the first attacks came the next day. By 28&nbsp;May, the battalion had concentrated at Ledringhem, where it was surrounded, and it withdrew under orders in the early hours of 29&nbsp;May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day and were subsequently taken off the beach by [[Little Ships of Dunkirk|little ships]]. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.<ref>Daniell pp. 260\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Retreat from Rangoon===\n[[File:Japanese Conquest of Burma April-May 1942.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Japanese Conquest of Burma April\u2013May 1942]]\nIn March 1942, the 1st Battalion provided the rearguard for the British retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. It saw its first significant action of the war on 7 and 8&nbsp;March at the [[Taukkyan Roadblock]], and for the rest of the month operated independently to cover the retreat, fighting battles at Letpadan on 17&nbsp;March and Paungde on 27&nbsp;March. In a subsequent battle near Padigong, {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from Paungde, D Company became isolated for 17 hours and had to fight its way back to the battalion at Shwedaung. In the meantime, the battalion became part of the [[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]] in the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Infantry Division]], which had to fight its way to and through Shwedaung when Japanese forces infiltrated between the rearguard and the main column. By the end of March, the 1st Battalion had been reduced to 140 all ranks, its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 270\u2013280</ref>\n\nIn mid-April, the under-strength battalion became so dispersed while protecting demolition parties at oil installations around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot returned from hospital he was informed the battalion had ceased to exist. He was nevertheless able to gather the remnants, now numbering 7 officers and 170 other ranks, at Shwebo on 27&nbsp;April, and the battalion was subsequently reinforced by a draft of 3 officers and 120 other ranks. When the Japanese threatened Monywa, Bagot took command of all the troops in the area, which included the 1st Battalion, to form Bagot Force. This mixed group of units fought a delaying action at Budalin, {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} north of Monywa, on 4&nbsp;May before withdrawing to Ye-u. The battalion continued to act as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9&nbsp;May and into India at Tamu at the end of the month.<ref>Daniell pp. 280\u2013286</ref> At the same time, the Japanese halted operations in Burma. Since the start of the retreat from Rangoon on 7&nbsp;March the battalion had lost 8 officers and 156 other ranks killed in action or died of sickness, and many more wounded.<ref>Daniell p. 285</ref> The battalion was rested and brought back up to strength in India, where it spent the remainder of the war, and saw no further action.<ref>Daniell pp. 308\u2013309</ref>\n\n===Home front===\nOn its return to the UK, the 5th Battalion was brought back up to strength and manned coastal defences in Cornwall. It converted to a reconnaissance role in June 1941, eventually becoming the [[43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment]], and from October it ceased to have any affiliation with the Gloucestershire Regiment.<ref>Daniell pp. 288\u2013289</ref><ref>Joslen p. 69</ref> Its duplicate, the 7th Battalion, was posted to Northern Ireland, but saw no action and became a training unit in 1944.<ref>Daniell p. 289</ref> With so many of its men languishing in POW camps, the 2nd Battalion was rebuilt and served in home defence at various locations around the UK, finally ending up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being assigned to a more active role.<ref>Daniell pp. 288, 292</ref>\n\nAs the UK braced itself for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German plan to invade, a number of [[Home Service Battalions|home defence]] battalions were raised under the regiment's colours. The 8th Battalion was formed from the [[National Defence Companies]] and consisted of men too old, too young or unfit for active service, and the younger contingent from this battalion later formed the 70th Battalion. The 9th and 10th Battalions were also raised, the former serving in Northern Ireland, the latter in south Wales and then Lincolnshire. The 11th Battalion was created in October 1940 from a re-designation of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 battalions of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] wore the badges of the regiment. As the threat of invasion receded, most of these home defence battalions were disbanded, the 8th and 70th in 1942, the 9th in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the 11th Battalion ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment when it was converted to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The 10th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942 and became the [[159th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|159th Regiment]] in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], though it retained the Glosters' cap badges. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it converted back to infantry and reverted to the regiment's 10th Battalion.<ref>Daniell pp. 289\u2013291, 310</ref>\n\n===Normandy landings and North-West Europe===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B15267.jpg|thumb|A soldier of Gloucestershire. Private G. Mills of the 2nd Battalion, 6&nbsp;March 1945.]]\nIn 1944, the 2nd Battalion was transferred to the [[56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|56th Independent Infantry Brigade]], and at 11:00 on 6&nbsp;June, during the [[Normandy landings]], the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at [[Gold Beach]]. The battalion saw action in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11&nbsp;June during [[Operation Perch]]; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30&nbsp;July during [[Operation Bluecoat]]; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12&nbsp;August in the prelude to [[Operation Tractable]].<ref>Daniell pp. 293\u2013300</ref> In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]], the 56th Brigade came under command of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], with which it remained for the rest of the war. During the advance to the River Seine, the 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing \u00c9paignes on 25&nbsp;August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2&nbsp;September. It spearheaded the [[Operation Astonia|assault on Le Havre]] eight days later, and it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, on 12&nbsp;September, capturing 1,500 prisoners and much beer for the loss during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 300\u2013302. Each man in the battalion received two bottles of beer on liberation of the fort's cellar. The battalion's quartermaster had to move fast to secure custody of the wine inventory before the quartermasters of other regiments arrived.</ref>\n\nFrom Le Havre, the 2nd Battalion advanced into Belgium, seeing action in the bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it fought at Stampersgat. The battalion reached Nijmegen in late November, where it spent over four relatively quiet months interrupted only by a four-day battle at Zetten in January 1945. The battalion's last significant action of the war came on 12&nbsp;April, when it assaulted across the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the rest of the 56th Brigade passed through to [[Liberation of Arnhem|capture the town itself]]. Following the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 8&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion entered Germany near Osnabr\u00fcck. It provided a detachment for the British guard at the [[Nuremberg trials]], and in August it was transferred to the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade|5th Guards Brigade]] stationed in Berlin. Between the Normandy landings on 6&nbsp;June 1944 and [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]] on 8&nbsp;May 1945 the battalion suffered 718 casualties. Among them was the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, died of wounds received during the attack at Stampersgat and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Bray (British Army officer)|Robert Bray]].<ref>Daniell pp. 302\u2013307</ref>\n\n===Burma Campaign 1944\u201345===\nOn reverting to the infantry role, the 10th Battalion was assigned to the [[72nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|72nd Brigade]] in the [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Division]]. The division was destined for [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|Burma]], and thus the battalion \"having been trained as infantry, tank troops, and combined-operations troops, went straight into jungle warfare, for which we had had no training\".<ref>Daniell p. 311. Quoting an officer of the battalion</ref> The Glosters arrived on the Arakan Peninsula (modern day Rakhine) in February 1944, were part of the relief effort in the [[Battle of the Admin Box]], and fought in dispersed, company-scale actions in the capture of the Mayu tunnels and Hambone Hill. The division went into reserve in May and was airlifted to Myitkyina in July, transferring to the [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under the American General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. It pushed south along the Mandalay railway and captured Taungni on 9&nbsp;August, during which period the 10th Battalion lost more men to sickness than enemy action. Brought back up to strength in September, the battalion was engaged in four days of fierce fighting at Pinwe in November, losing all the officers in both A and C Companies, and all but one in B Company, before being relieved on 26&nbsp;November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|title=Front Line Frankie & Vinegar Joe&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023231213/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 311\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe 36th Division continued its advance south in January 1945, and the 10th Battalion saw action in a series of short battles around Mabein that month. The battalion saw its last action of the war supporting the [[26th Indian Infantry Brigade|26th Indian Brigade]] attack at Myitson on the River Shweli, during which D Company was cut off for five days before the rest of the battalion was able to link up with it on 16&nbsp;February. Of the 250 or so men in the battalion before the battle, 119 were killed or wounded by the time the Japanese withdrew on 17&nbsp;February. Although the men had fought well, there were bitter recriminations over the conduct of the battle between the commander of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the 10th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which resulted in Butler being sacked. After reaching Mandalay, the battalion returned to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|title=The End of the War in South-East Asia&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024095433/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|archive-date=2017-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 320\u2013324</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nThe regiment accrued 20 different battle honours and lost 870 men killed in the nine battalions that had served under its colours during the Second World War.

That same year, the 1st Battalion was reduced to a cadre and returned from India to the UK, and the 2nd Battalion was posted to Jamaica and detached companies to Bermuda and British Honduras (modern day Belize). It was in Jamaica that, in accordance with the restructuring of the British Army, the regiment's two battalions swapped colours and amalgamated to form the single-battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21&nbsp;September 1948.<ref>Daniell pp. 325\u2013331</ref>\n\n==Korean War==\n[[File:Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nAfter its return to the UK in 1949, the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[James Carne]], was assigned to the [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group]], and on 3&nbsp;November 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the battalion arrived with the brigade in Korea.

On the first day of the battle, UN forces fell back to Line Kansas, but both the Koreans and the British were already on Line Kansas, and did not have as much leeway to fall back. Later in the war an entire division would be allocated to the same frontage as the 29th Brigade were required to hold.<ref>Salmon pp. 127\u2013128, 309\u2013310</ref>}} The battalion's second-in-command, Major Digby Grist, was with rear headquarters (\"F echelon\") some {{convert|5|mi|km|0|spell=on}} behind, on route Five Yankee (5Y) to Seoul.<ref>Daniell p. 348</ref><ref>Salmon p. 175</ref> There was a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|0}} gap between the Glosters and the 1st Battalion [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] on their right, and on their left the 12th Regiment of the South Korean (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Infantry Division]] was {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away.<ref>Mossman p. 385</ref>\n\nAfter nightfall on 22&nbsp;April, the Chinese launched the [[Chinese Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], the first phase of which was designed to eliminate the US 3rd Division, the 29th Brigade and the ROK 1st Division. Success would allow them to attack the US 24th and 25th Divisions in the flank and leave the way open to Seoul. Against the four battalions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the [[63rd Army (People's Republic of China)|63rd Army]], comprising the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; some 27,000 men in 27 infantry battalions.<ref>Salmon pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\n====First night&nbsp;\u2013 attacks on A and D Companies and the F echelon====\n\nAt 22:00, a 17-man patrol from C Company in position on the river bank, supported by the guns of the 45th Field Regiment, engaged the leading Chinese troops three times as they attempted to cross the ford.

An attempt to retake it failed, and the company, now at less than half strength and with all officers killed or wounded, fell back to Hill 235.

Through the night the men of B Company, led by Major Edgar Harding and outnumbered 18:1, endured six assaults, calling in artillery on their own position to break up the last of them. Low on ammunition and having taken many casualties, the company was forced from its position by the seventh assault at 08:10, and just 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which the battalion HQ, Support and C Companies had already withdrawn.<ref>Salmon pp. 176\u2013184</ref>{{efn|Accounts of C Company's action at Hill 314 during the night of 23/24 April are contradictory. Battalion adjutant Captain Farrar-Hockley, B Company commander Major Harding and Private David Green, who fought with C Company, all state in their books that the company was subject to a strong attack and ordered to withdraw during the night, and Daniell, p. 351, states that only a third of the company reached Hill 235. Lieutenant Temple and Private Coombes, both of C Company, state that the company was not subject to any major attack, and Temple states that, in the absence of the company commander, who went missing sometime during the night, he ordered the company to withdraw after daybreak on his own initiative.<ref>Salmon p. 180</ref>}} With the Glosters' position still vital to the integrity of Line Kansas, Carne received orders at 07:00 on 24&nbsp;April from the 3rd Division commander, General [[Robert H. Soule|Soule]], to stand his ground. He was advised that reinforcements, comprising tanks of the 8th Hussars and Philippine [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea|10th Battalion Combat Team]] and the troops of the Glosters' own rear echelon, were being sent up route 5Y.<ref name=\"Salmon p. 187\">Salmon p. 187</ref> The armour got to within {{convert|2000|yd|m}} of the Glosters' position before being halted in an ambush around 15:00, condemning the Glosters to another night alone on Hill 235.<ref>Salmon p. 187\u2013190, 308</ref>{{efn|Some accounts state that the armoured column was being sent to relieve the Glosters on Hill 235, that Carne was given permission to withdraw to meet it two hours after being ordered to remain in position, and that, unwilling to abandon his wounded, he elected to remain and await its arrival. Carne, however, had expressed doubts to his brigade commander during the battle that the force was sufficiently strong to reach him, and later stated that he was not given the option to withdraw on 24&nbsp;April and that it was his understanding that the armoured column was being sent to reinforce rather than relieve him.<ref name=\"Salmon p. 187\">Salmon p. 187</ref>}}\n\n====Third night&nbsp;\u2013 last stand on Hill 235====\n\n[[File:Gloster Hill.jpg|thumb|upright|Gloster Hill (Hill 235) five weeks after the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nBy the afternoon of 24&nbsp;April, the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery now fighting alongside as infantry, had been reduced to an effective fighting force of 400\u2013450 men. They were low on ammunition, though in their favour the 45th Field Regiment were still able to provide support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments).<ref>Salmon pp. 129, 203\u2013206</ref> The Glosters fought through the night of 24\u201325&nbsp;April, during which the peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill. It was recaptured in a counter-attack led by the [[adjutant]], Captain [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]], and the Chinese launched seven attacks in one hour in an attempt to take it again, all without success. Their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with the 45th Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support. Carne received permission to attempt a breakout at 06:05. He had no choice but to leave the wounded, estimated at some 100. The survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.<ref>Salmon pp. 206\u2013225</ref>\n\n====After the battle====\n\nThe Glosters' stand had plugged a large gap in the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would otherwise have left the flanks of the ROK 1st and US 3rd Divisions vulnerable. Their presence also threatened the rear of the Chinese forces as they advanced and denied them the use of routes south for their artillery and mule trains. General [[James Van Fleet]], commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]], described the stand as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\",<ref name=salmon-quotes>Salmon p. 314</ref> and in a letter to General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgeway]], commander-in-chief of UN forces in Korea, he wrote that \"the loss of 622 officers and men saved many times that number\".<ref name=salmon-quotes /> The 29th Brigade commander, Brigadier [[Thomas Brodie]], christened the regiment ''The Glorious Glosters'', a sobriquet that was repeated in the headlines of the day, and Hill 235 became known as ''Gloster Hill'', at the foot of which the [[Gloucester Valley Battle Monument]] was built in 1957.<ref>Salmon p. 307</ref><ref name=imjin /><ref>Daniell p. 375</ref>\n\nThe other battalions of the 29th Brigade had also been engaged in desperate fighting, though without the same scale of losses, and in total the brigade suffered 1,091 casualties.

The Korean War accounted for 113 fatalities among the Glosters, 36 of them in captivity.<ref>Daniell pp. 356, 358, 365, 427</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n[[File:Glosters colours.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Parading the colours at Catterick Garrison on Back Badge Day 1993]]\nWhile the Korean War continued, the regiment was engaged in more ceremonial affairs at home. It lined the route of King [[George VI|George VI's]] funeral procession on 15&nbsp;February 1952, and it was presented with its first colours at a ceremony in Gloucester on 26&nbsp;April, the two regular battalions having retained those of their predecessor regiments up to that point. On 2&nbsp;June 1953, 400 men from both the 1st and 5th Battalions took part in the procession at the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>Daniell pp. 360, 362\u2013364</ref> Between 1955 and 1994, the regiment returned to more martial duties, for the most part patrolling the shrinking [[British Empire]] with tours of duty in [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]],  [[Colony of Aden|Aden]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cyprus Emergency|Cyprus]], [[Belize]], [[Gibraltar]] and the African colonies of [[Swaziland]], [[Mauritius]], [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] and [[Basutoland]]. The regiment also participated in the British contribution to [[NATO]] in Germany, serving three tours with the [[British Army of the Rhine]] and two with the [[Berlin Infantry Brigade|British garrison in Berlin]], and between 1968 and 1991 it completed seven tours in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]], in which it lost five men killed.<ref>Daniell pp. 368\u2013406, 427</ref>\n\nIn March 1967, the 1st Battalion became the sole unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment when, as a result of a reorganisation of the TA, the 5th Battalion became A Company of the Wessex Volunteers in the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The regiment narrowly avoided amalgamation with the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]] in 1970, and it celebrated its tercentenary in early March 1994; 300 years since the raising of Gibson's Regiment of Foot. But by that time, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] had prompted the government to [[Options for Change|restructure the armed forces]]. As a result, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment maintained the back badge tradition, and when it was in turn amalgamated in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor regiment, [[The Rifles]], who wear the back badge with their ceremonial uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glosters.org/bbadge.htm|title=RGBW Regimental Association|publisher=Glosters RGBW Regimental Association|accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/5127944.stm|title=Back Badge survives second merger|date=2006-06-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Glosters paraded for the last time on 26&nbsp;March 1994 in Gloucester.

It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, which was raised in 1694 and later became the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]]. It inherited the unique distinction in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its headdress as well as the front, a tradition that originated with the 28th Regiment after it fought in two ranks back to back at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two [[Regular army|regular]], two [[Militia (Great Britain)|militia]] and two [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer]] battalions, and saw its first action during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], the regiment's four auxiliary battalions were converted to three [[Territorial Force]] battalions and a [[Special Reserve]] battalion, and a further 18 battalions were added to the regiment's establishment during the war. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing a total of 8,100 men killed and winning 72 different [[battle honour]]s. Four awards of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. The wartime battalions were disbanded as the war ended, and just before the [[Second World War]], two of the territorial battalions were re-purposed and ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the remaining territorial battalion was duplicated, and another five battalions were raised on the outbreak of war, though most of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war progressed. Four battalions saw active service under the regiment's colours during the war. The 2nd and 5th Battalions both fought in the [[Battle of France]] and, after being lost almost in its entirety during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], the re-formed 2nd Battalion landed at [[Gold Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] and fought in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaign in North-West Europe. The 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]], and the 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of Japanese forces during the [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, the hostilities-only battalions were disbanded and the 1st and 2nd Battalions were [[wikt:amalgamated|amalgamated]], leaving the regiment with one regular and one [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] battalion. It achieved fame during the [[Korean War]] when the 1st Battalion held out for three nights against overwhelming odds during the [[Battle of the Imjin River]]. The stand, described by the commander of the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea at the time as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\", prevented the encirclement of other United Nations forces, for which the regiment was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and earned the nickname ''The Glorious Glosters''. Two men serving with the regiment were awarded the VC for their actions in the battle. In the latter half of the 20th century, the regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion and completed tours of duty around the world, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, as well as in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]]. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which carried more battle honours on its [[Military colours, standards and guidons|colours]] than any other regiment of the line, was merged with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment inherited the back badge, and when it too was merged in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor, [[The Rifles]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Soldier of 28th regiment 1742.jpg|thumb|upright|Uniform of the 28th c.1742 with its yellow [[Facing colour|facings]]]]\n\nThe Gloucestershire Regiment traced its roots to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, raised in 1694 in Portsmouth,<ref>Daniell p. 3</ref> which first saw action in 1705 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 12</ref> Having been commanded by, and therefore named after, a succession of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and fought under this name during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>Daniell p. 18</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|title=Bragg\u2019s Regiment and the 28th Foot&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230907/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1742/05/20/braggs-regiment-and-the-28th-foot/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another predecessor, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was formed in 1758 when the British Army was expanded during the [[Seven Years' War]].

For the first time the county of [[Gloucestershire]] was associated with both the 28th and 61st Regiments, which were renamed as the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|title=North and South Gloucestershire&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107013144/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1782/05/20/north-and-south-gloucestershire/|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Both regiments began to recruit from the county, and it was in Gloucester in December 1782 that the 61st Regiment was presented with new colours to replace those lost during the [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|Franco-Spanish invasion of Minorca]] earlier that year.<ref>Daniell p. 54</ref>\n\nIn March 1801, the 28th Regiment formed part of the British expeditionary force that landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to oppose [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] Army of the East. On 21&nbsp;March, during the [[Battle of Alexandria]], French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. With the men still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given for the rear rank to turn about, and standing thus in two ranks back to back, the regiment held the line. To commemorate this action, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress, a unique distinction in the British Army that was officially sanctioned in 1830.<ref>Daniell pp. 69\u201375</ref><ref name=Grazebrook>Grazebrook pp. 112\u2013113</ref>{{efn|The origins of the back badge and its initial form are not known; other than the honour \"Egypt\", awarded to all units, there is no record of a special badge being officially granted. An officer who served with the regiment between 1805 and 1807 wrote that the regiment \"acquired the emblem of the double front.\" In 1815, a staff officer witnessed the regiment marching out to Quatre Bras \"having their number both in front and rear of their low caps\u2014a memorial of Egypt.\" The first record of official recognition appears in an 1830 letter from the [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], which states that \"it was never the intention to deprive the 28th Regiment of any badge of honour they may have acquired by their distinguished service in Egypt, and that there will be no objection to their retaining the plate they have been accustomed to wear on the back of their caps since that service...\" This was officially confirmed in another letter dated 1843. It is possible, therefore, that the back badge was introduced by the regiment shortly after the Battle of Alexandria, but not officially sanctioned until 1830.<ref name=Grazebrook />}} The 61st Regiment also deployed to Egypt and, although arriving too late to play an active part, was, like the 28th Regiment, awarded the battle honour \"Egypt\" and the right to display the Sphinx on its colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1801/05/20/the-battle-of-alexandria/|title=The Battle of Alexandria&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=5 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230643/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1801/05/20/the-battle-of-alexandria/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Butler Lady Quatre Bras 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''[[The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras]]'']]\nDuring the 19th century, relatively uneventful postings at home and abroad were punctuated with periods of active service. The 28th and 61st Regiments both fought in Spain and Portugal during the [[Peninsular War]].<ref>Daniell ch.IX\u2013X</ref> The 28th Regiment also participated in the final defeat of Napoleon; it was commended by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] for gallantry in the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] and saw action again in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>Daniell ch.XI</ref> In the mid-19th century, both regiments were deployed to India, and the 61st Regiment saw active service during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]], adding \"Chillianwallah\", \"Goojerat\", \"Punjaub\" and \"Delhi 1857\" to the list of battle honours that the Gloucestershire Regiment would soon inherit. The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and added \"Alma\", \"Inkerman\" and \"Sevastopol\" to its legacy.<ref>Daniell ch.XIII\u2013XIV</ref>\n\nAnother thread that would be woven into the story of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the civilian administered auxiliary forces which supported the army in times of need. In the mid-18th century, county [[Militia (Great Britain)|militias]] were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and these were organised in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at [[Cecily Hill Barracks|Cirencester]].<ref>Daniell p. 26</ref> In 1859, county-based [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer rifle corps]] were raised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.<ref>Daniell pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Colours in Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|The regimental colours in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]\nIn 1872, the [[Cardwell Reforms]] began the process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line infantry regiments, a process that was completed by the [[Childers Reforms]] nine years later. As a result, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at [[Horfield Barracks]] in Bristol.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24992|pages=3300\u20133301|date=1 July 1881}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 186\u2013187.

It was a privilege that the 2nd Battalion did not want, but it was made palatable to the former 61st Regiment by replacing the number 28 with the Sphinx, a battle honour awarded to both predecessor regiments.<ref name=\"formation\"/> Although both battalions were forced to give up their individual [[facing colour]]s on their uniforms&nbsp;\u2013 yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st Regiment&nbsp;\u2013 when the government imposed a standard white across all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never accepted this change for their [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]]. Both battalions retained their former colours until 1929, when a compromise primrose yellow was finally chosen and a new regimental colour subsequently presented.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 188</ref>\n\nThe two battalions continued to refer to themselves by their former regimental numbers until they were merged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment became a single-battalion regiment. The 1st Battalion celebrated the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the anniversary of the Battle of Alexandria annually. The 2nd Battalion, on the other hand, held games followed by a dinner and a ball on the anniversary of the 61st Regiment's victory at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwallah]] on 13 January 1849 when overseas, or on the anniversary of that regiment's victory at [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]] on 22 July 1812 when at home.<ref name=\"formation\"/><ref>Daniell p. 189</ref>\n\nThe new regiment acquired its march, ''The Kinnegad Slashers'', and its official nickname, ''Slashers'', from the 28th Regiment. The name arose from an incident in 1764, when members of the regiment allegedly slashed off part of the ear of a Montreal magistrate who had been harassing soldiers stationed in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was also sometimes referred to as ''The Old Braggs'', from Colonel [[Philip Bragg]], who commanded the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two other nicknames associated with the new regiment were inherited from the 61st Regiment; ''The Flowers of Toulouse'', from the scarlet uniforms of that regiment's many dead in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]], and ''The Silver-Tailed Dandies'', from the silver decorations on the longer-than-normal coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform.<ref>Daniell pp. 17, 41\u201342, 118, 178</ref>\n\n==Second Boer War==\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon. The Gloucestershire Regiment was blooded at Ladysmith, and the survivors helped defend the city until its relief on 1&nbsp;March 1900.]]\nThe Gloucestershire Regiment began life quietly. The two battalions alternated between postings at home and overseas, mostly in India, but their first action came in 1899 during the [[Second Boer War]]. Deployed to Ladysmith, the 1st Battalion was part of a column sent out on 24&nbsp;October to cover the withdrawal of a brigade after the [[Battle of Talana Hill]]. When the column came under fire near Rietfontein, the battalion was detached and ordered forward, but the order was ambiguous and the battalion advanced too far. The troops were caught in the open for several hours before they were able to extricate themselves at the cost of five men killed, including the battalion commander, and 58 wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 190\u2013191</ref>\n\nFive days later, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion were part of a small force tasked with seizing Nicholson's Nek, a pass some {{convert|6|mi|km|-1}} north of Ladysmith, during the [[Battle of Ladysmith]]. The troops moved out on the night of 29&nbsp;October with the intention to be in position before the main battle started, but they left too late to reach their objective before daybreak. As they took up an alternative position on the nearby Tchrengula Hill the pack-mules bolted, taking most of the heavy weaponry and ammunition with them. The Boers discovered the incursion at dawn and surrounded the position, and although the British held out for several hours they were forced to surrender at 12:30. The battalion lost 38 killed and 115 wounded, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Pretoria.<ref>Daniell pp. 191\u2013194</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|title=The Siege of Ladysmith&nbsp;\u2013 Soldier of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013173326/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1899/05/19/the-siege-of-ladysmith/|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhile the remainder of the 1st Battalion helped in the defence of Ladysmith (the city was eventually [[relief of Ladysmith|relieved]] on 1&nbsp;March), the 2nd Battalion deployed to South Africa, arriving in January 1900. The battalion fought in the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], a nine-day battle which ended on 27&nbsp;February with the capture of the Boer general [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] and his force of some 4,000 men.

Their first significant experience of battle came during the Somme offensive; on 16&nbsp;July, during the Battle of Bazentin, the 1/4th Battalion fought north of Ovillers, and the 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions went into action in the same area on 20 and 21&nbsp;July respectively. They returned to the area during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res and fought a number of actions between 13 and 27&nbsp;August. In February 1917, the 48th Division moved to positions opposite P\u00e9ronne, and the territorials saw action in March and April during the general advance that followed the [[Operation Alberich|German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line]].<ref>Littlewood pp. 37\u201339, 59\u201360, 88\u201389</ref> The division moved again in July, to Ypres, where the territorials fought in engagements of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]; the 1/5th Battalion in the [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Battle of Langemarck]] and the [[Battle of Broodseinde]], and the 1/4th and 1/6th Battalions in the [[Action of 22 August 1917]] and the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]].

In June 1918, the 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions were in action during the [[Second Battle of the Piave River]], and the 1/4th and 1/6th Battalions fought their last actions of the war in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] at the beginning of November.<ref>Wyrall pp. 334\u2013348</ref> Meanwhile, the 1/5th Battalion was transferred in September 1918 to the [[75th Brigade (United Kingdom)|75th Brigade]] of the [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]] and returned to France. In October, it fought in the capture of the Beaurevoir Line during the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and in the [[Battle of the Selle]]. During the latter, the battalion was held up for nearly four hours until Private [[Francis George Miles]] went forward alone and knocked out two enemy machine-gun positions, for which action he was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC).

The 61st Division was transferred north to help reinforce First Army in April, and the 2/5th Battalion fought a number of actions south-west of Merville during the Battle of the Lys. In August, the battalion attempted to force a bridgehead across a stream in Nieppe Forest, west of Merville, and fought on 1&nbsp;September during the advance to the River Lys. The battalion was in battle again on 30&nbsp;September at Fleurbaix, south-west of Armenti\u00e8res, and saw its last action of the war on 1 and 2&nbsp;November during the [[Battle of Valenciennes (1918)|Battle of Valenciennes]].<ref>Littlewood pp. 53, 75\u201378, 101</ref>\n\n===New Army===\nAs volunteers answered [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] call to arms, ten [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] battalions, the 7th to the 16th, were added to the regiment's establishment between 1914 and 1916.

The battalion fought its first action on 8&nbsp;August in the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], during which it suffered over 820 casualties, including all of its officers, [[warrant officer]]s and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s. It was brought back up to strength and moved to Egypt in January 1916. In March, the 13th Division was transferred to Mesopotamia, but on landing at Basra the battalion was put out of action by an outbreak of [[Relapsing fever borreliosis|relapsing fever]]. It rejoined the division in the middle of April and fought in the unsuccessful attempt to lift the [[siege of Kut]]. The battalion saw action in December 1916 and February 1917 during the subsequent advance on and [[Second Battle of Kut|capture of Kut]], and fought its last battle on 29&nbsp;March 1917 during the [[Samarrah Offensive|Samarrah offensive]].

It arrived in France in July 1915 as part of the [[57th Brigade (United Kingdom)|57th Brigade]] in the [[19th (Western) Division]]<ref name=James /> and saw its first action the next year during the [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Battle of Albert]], in which it helped [[Capture of La Boisselle|capture La Boisselle]]. The division's 58th Brigade had captured the western half of the village on 2&nbsp;July, and the 8th Battalion [[North Staffordshire Regiment]] and 10th Battalion [[Worcestershire Regiment]], both of the 57th Brigade, assisted in the capture of the rest of the village the next day. A German counter-attack regained the eastern half of the village, and the 8th Glosters suffered 302 casualties when it fought alongside the 10th Battalion [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] to help retake it. During the battle, the Glosters' commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], assumed command of all four 57th Brigade battalions when the other three commanding officers became casualties, and for his actions in averting a serious reverse he was awarded the VC. Later the same month, during the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res, the battalion made two unsuccessful attacks against the German line east of the village which together cost it 374 casualties, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major [[Lord Alexander Thynne|Lord A.G. Thynne]], both wounded. On 18&nbsp;November, the last day of the Somme offensive, the battalion suffered 295 casualties when it captured Grandcourt during the [[Battle of the Ancre]].<ref>Littlewood pp. 117\u2013118.

The battalion was next in action on the evening of 21&nbsp;March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive, when the Germans captured Doignies. Unable to recapture the village, the battalion blocked any further enemy progress until the morning of 23&nbsp;March, when German forces broke through on the left and threatened to outflank it. Company A fought to the last man covering the battalion's withdrawal, for which action the company commander, Captain [[Manley Angell James]], was awarded the VC. By the time the 19th Division withdrew to Doullens on 28&nbsp;March the battalion had suffered 323 casualties.<ref>Littlewood pp. 119\u2013121, 185</ref> In April, the battalion fought in three engagements of the Battle of the Lys: the Battles of Messines, Bailleul and First Kemmel. The following month, the 19th Division's parent unit, [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], was transferred to the French Sixth Army. The division was supposed to rest and re-organise in a quiet sector, but on 27&nbsp;May the Germans launched a major attack, ensnaring the 8th Battalion in the [[Third Battle of the Aisne]].

The battalion participated in two attacks against the Bulgarian lines, on 25&nbsp;April and 8&nbsp;May 1917, during the [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Battle of Dojran]]. In July 1918, the battalion was transferred to the [[198th (East Lancashire) Brigade|198th Brigade]] of the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Division]] in France, becoming the divisional pioneers, and was disbanded in November 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n====10th Battalion====\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=My word, as soon as the order was given the Gloucesters were out and over the parapet and soon doing great havoc among the Germans.\n|author=Unnamed lance-corporal, 10th Battalion<br />Battle of Loos<ref>Daniell p. 209</ref>}}\nThe 10th Battalion was raised in September 1914 in Bristol, but was recruited mainly by volunteers from Cheltenham.<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 139</ref> It crossed to France in August 1915 and replaced one of the Guards battalions in the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Brigade]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]].

The battalion's last action of the war came on 9&nbsp;September, in a failed attack on High Wood which cost it 122 casualties. In 1917, the 1st Division was allocated to Operation Hush, and when that was cancelled the 10th battalion moved to the Ypres area.

It saw action again towards the end of 1916 during operations on the Ancre, including the [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]] and the Battle of the Ancre. In March 1918, the battalion suffered particularly badly in the opening week of the [[German Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], during which it was required to take positions in the line as infantry, and by the time the division was withdrawn on 31&nbsp;March the battalion had sustained 326 casualties. In April, the survivors were allocated to composite infantry battalions and saw their last action on 26&nbsp;April during the Second Battle of Kemmel, part of the Battle of the Lys, after which the battalion was reduced to a training cadre.<ref>Littlewood pp. 159\u2013162</ref>\n\n====14th Battalion (West of England)====\nThe 14th Battalion was a [[Bantam (military)|bantam]] unit of volunteers from Bristol and Birmingham who had previously been rejected for service because of their short height. It was raised in April 1915 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee, adopted by the War Office in June 1915, and departed for France in January 1916 as part of the [[105th Brigade (United Kingdom)|105th Brigade]] in the [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]].<ref name=James /><ref>Littlewood p. 167</ref> The battalion went into the line in March, where the men's first task was to raise the height of the [[wikt:fire step|firing step]],<ref>Daniell pp. 225\u2013226</ref> and its first significant action came on 8&nbsp;June, when it conducted a large raid south-east of Neuve Chapelle. In July, following the [[capture of Tr\u00f4nes Wood]] by the 18th Division during the Battle of Bazentin, the battalion moved into the line at the northern end of the wood where, on 19&nbsp;July, it suffered 107 casualties to enemy artillery.<ref>Westlake p. 138</ref> On 21&nbsp;August 1917, while in the line near \u00c9pehy, the Germans attacked one of the battalion's bombing posts. Although his bombing party were driven back, Second-Lieutenant [[Hardy Falconer Parsons]] remained and prevented the enemy from entering the trenches, for which act he was posthumously awarded the VC. The battalion fought in the Action of 22&nbsp;October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw its last action on 4&nbsp;February 1918, when it successfully attacked a fortified farm in the Ypres sector. Seven days later the battalion was disbanded and its men transferred to the 13th Battalion.<ref>Littlewood pp. 167\u2013170</ref>\n\n====18th Battalion====\nThe 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]], and decamped to France in August 1918 as part of the [[49th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division|16th Division]]. It went into action on 11&nbsp;September, when it successfully assaulted the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its last action on 18&nbsp;September, when a German attack drove A Company from its forward posts. The battalion was disbanded in June 1919.<ref>Littlewood pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n===Fifth Gloucester Gazette===\n[[File:Lieutenant FW Harvey DCM.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant F. W.

The first issue appeared on 12&nbsp;April 1915 and foreshadowed more famous trench journals such as ''[[The Wipers Times]]''. It ran for 25 issues, the last of which appeared in January 1919.

The 1st Battalion completed tours of duty in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican [[Se\u00e1n Moylan]], and Germany, which counted as a home posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In 1928, the 2nd Battalion returned to the UK and the 1st Battalion was posted overseas, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938.<ref>Daniell pp. 232\u2013235</ref> Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937.<ref>Daniell p. 237</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|title=Egypt and Preparation for War|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163707/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1936/05/19/egypt-and-preparation-for-war/|archive-date=2017-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, the 5th Battalion became the regiment's sole territorial unit when the 4th Battalion was converted to the [[66th (Gloucesters) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (RA), and the 6th Battalion converted to the [[44th Royal Tank Regiment|44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Daniell p. 239</ref> On the eve of the [[Second World War]], the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and the 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line duplicate of the 5th Battalion.<ref>Daniell p. 425</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:\n* 1st Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 stationed around Rangoon in Burma<ref>Daniell p. 265</ref>\n* 2nd Battalion&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]] in the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]<ref>Joslen p. 246</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#5th_Gloucesters|5th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 144th Infantry Brigade in the 48th Division<ref>Joslen p. 329</ref>\n* [[2nd_Gloucestershire_Rifle_Volunteers#7th_Gloucesters|7th Battalion]] (TA)&nbsp;\u2013 assigned to the 183rd Infantry Brigade in the 61st Division<ref>Joslen p. 376</ref>\n\n===Battle of France===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=Completely surrounded, with our lack of weapons there was only one thing to do.

This brought it alongside the 5th Battalion in the division's 144th Brigade, which had arrived in France on 15&nbsp;January 1940.<ref>Daniell pp. 242\u2013244</ref> In May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], the German [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|breakthrough at Sedan]] precipitated a retreat to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The 5th Battalion marched {{convert|95|mi|km|-1}} in 83 hours with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in a matter of minutes to an airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20&nbsp;May, when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) for two days before the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] resumed its retreat. On 25&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of Somer Force. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the [[Battle of Dunkirk|outer perimeter around Dunkirk]]. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27&nbsp;May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29&nbsp;May, but few made it to Dunkirk. The 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties at Cassel, 484 of them POWs.<ref>Daniell pp. 251\u2013259</ref> Meanwhile, the 5th Battalion was given a similar task at the villages of Arneke and Ledringhem, some {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26&nbsp;May, and the first attacks came the next day. By 28&nbsp;May, the battalion had concentrated at Ledringhem, where it was surrounded, and it withdrew under orders in the early hours of 29&nbsp;May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day and were subsequently taken off the beach by [[Little Ships of Dunkirk|little ships]]. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.<ref>Daniell pp. 260\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Retreat from Rangoon===\n[[File:Japanese Conquest of Burma April-May 1942.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Japanese Conquest of Burma April\u2013May 1942]]\nIn March 1942, the 1st Battalion provided the rearguard for the British retreat from Rangoon during the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. It saw its first significant action of the war on 7 and 8&nbsp;March at the [[Taukkyan Roadblock]], and for the rest of the month operated independently to cover the retreat, fighting battles at Letpadan on 17&nbsp;March and Paungde on 27&nbsp;March. In a subsequent battle near Padigong, {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from Paungde, D Company became isolated for 17 hours and had to fight its way back to the battalion at Shwedaung. In the meantime, the battalion became part of the [[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]] in the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Infantry Division]], which had to fight its way to and through Shwedaung when Japanese forces infiltrated between the rearguard and the main column. By the end of March, the 1st Battalion had been reduced to 140 all ranks, its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 270\u2013280</ref>\n\nIn mid-April, the under-strength battalion became so dispersed while protecting demolition parties at oil installations around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot returned from hospital he was informed the battalion had ceased to exist. He was nevertheless able to gather the remnants, now numbering 7 officers and 170 other ranks, at Shwebo on 27&nbsp;April, and the battalion was subsequently reinforced by a draft of 3 officers and 120 other ranks. When the Japanese threatened Monywa, Bagot took command of all the troops in the area, which included the 1st Battalion, to form Bagot Force. This mixed group of units fought a delaying action at Budalin, {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} north of Monywa, on 4&nbsp;May before withdrawing to Ye-u. The battalion continued to act as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9&nbsp;May and into India at Tamu at the end of the month.<ref>Daniell pp. 280\u2013286</ref> At the same time, the Japanese halted operations in Burma. Since the start of the retreat from Rangoon on 7&nbsp;March the battalion had lost 8 officers and 156 other ranks killed in action or died of sickness, and many more wounded.<ref>Daniell p. 285</ref> The battalion was rested and brought back up to strength in India, where it spent the remainder of the war, and saw no further action.<ref>Daniell pp. 308\u2013309</ref>\n\n===Home front===\nOn its return to the UK, the 5th Battalion was brought back up to strength and manned coastal defences in Cornwall. It converted to a reconnaissance role in June 1941, eventually becoming the [[43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment]], and from October it ceased to have any affiliation with the Gloucestershire Regiment.<ref>Daniell pp. 288\u2013289</ref><ref>Joslen p. 69</ref> Its duplicate, the 7th Battalion, was posted to Northern Ireland, but saw no action and became a training unit in 1944.<ref>Daniell p. 289</ref> With so many of its men languishing in POW camps, the 2nd Battalion was rebuilt and served in home defence at various locations around the UK, finally ending up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being assigned to a more active role.<ref>Daniell pp. 288, 292</ref>\n\nAs the UK braced itself for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German plan to invade, a number of [[Home Service Battalions|home defence]] battalions were raised under the regiment's colours. The 8th Battalion was formed from the [[National Defence Companies]] and consisted of men too old, too young or unfit for active service, and the younger contingent from this battalion later formed the 70th Battalion. The 9th and 10th Battalions were also raised, the former serving in Northern Ireland, the latter in south Wales and then Lincolnshire. The 11th Battalion was created in October 1940 from a re-designation of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 battalions of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] wore the badges of the regiment. As the threat of invasion receded, most of these home defence battalions were disbanded, the 8th and 70th in 1942, the 9th in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the 11th Battalion ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment when it was converted to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The 10th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942 and became the [[159th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|159th Regiment]] in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], though it retained the Glosters' cap badges. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it converted back to infantry and reverted to the regiment's 10th Battalion.<ref>Daniell pp. 289\u2013291, 310</ref>\n\n===Normandy landings and North-West Europe===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B15267.jpg|thumb|A soldier of Gloucestershire. Private G. Mills of the 2nd Battalion, 6&nbsp;March 1945.]]\nIn 1944, the 2nd Battalion was transferred to the [[56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|56th Independent Infantry Brigade]], and at 11:00 on 6&nbsp;June, during the [[Normandy landings]], the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at [[Gold Beach]]. The battalion saw action in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11&nbsp;June during [[Operation Perch]]; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30&nbsp;July during [[Operation Bluecoat]]; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12&nbsp;August in the prelude to [[Operation Tractable]].<ref>Daniell pp. 293\u2013300</ref> In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]], the 56th Brigade came under command of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], with which it remained for the rest of the war. During the advance to the River Seine, the 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing \u00c9paignes on 25&nbsp;August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2&nbsp;September. It spearheaded the [[Operation Astonia|assault on Le Havre]] eight days later, and it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, on 12&nbsp;September, capturing 1,500 prisoners and much beer for the loss during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.<ref>Daniell pp. 300\u2013302. Each man in the battalion received two bottles of beer on liberation of the fort's cellar. The battalion's quartermaster had to move fast to secure custody of the wine inventory before the quartermasters of other regiments arrived.</ref>\n\nFrom Le Havre, the 2nd Battalion advanced into Belgium, seeing action in the bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it fought at Stampersgat. The battalion reached Nijmegen in late November, where it spent over four relatively quiet months interrupted only by a four-day battle at Zetten in January 1945. The battalion's last significant action of the war came on 12&nbsp;April, when it assaulted across the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the rest of the 56th Brigade passed through to [[Liberation of Arnhem|capture the town itself]]. Following the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 8&nbsp;May, the 2nd Battalion entered Germany near Osnabr\u00fcck. It provided a detachment for the British guard at the [[Nuremberg trials]], and in August it was transferred to the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade|5th Guards Brigade]] stationed in Berlin. Between the Normandy landings on 6&nbsp;June 1944 and [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]] on 8&nbsp;May 1945 the battalion suffered 718 casualties. Among them was the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, died of wounds received during the attack at Stampersgat and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Bray (British Army officer)|Robert Bray]].<ref>Daniell pp. 302\u2013307</ref>\n\n===Burma Campaign 1944\u201345===\nOn reverting to the infantry role, the 10th Battalion was assigned to the [[72nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|72nd Brigade]] in the [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Division]]. The division was destined for [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|Burma]], and thus the battalion \"having been trained as infantry, tank troops, and combined-operations troops, went straight into jungle warfare, for which we had had no training\".<ref>Daniell p. 311. Quoting an officer of the battalion</ref> The Glosters arrived on the Arakan Peninsula (modern day Rakhine) in February 1944, were part of the relief effort in the [[Battle of the Admin Box]], and fought in dispersed, company-scale actions in the capture of the Mayu tunnels and Hambone Hill. The division went into reserve in May and was airlifted to Myitkyina in July, transferring to the [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under the American General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. It pushed south along the Mandalay railway and captured Taungni on 9&nbsp;August, during which period the 10th Battalion lost more men to sickness than enemy action. Brought back up to strength in September, the battalion was engaged in four days of fierce fighting at Pinwe in November, losing all the officers in both A and C Companies, and all but one in B Company, before being relieved on 26&nbsp;November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|title=Front Line Frankie & Vinegar Joe&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023231213/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1944/05/18/front-line-frankie-vinegar-joe/|archive-date=2017-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 311\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe 36th Division continued its advance south in January 1945, and the 10th Battalion saw action in a series of short battles around Mabein that month. The battalion saw its last action of the war supporting the [[26th Indian Infantry Brigade|26th Indian Brigade]] attack at Myitson on the River Shweli, during which D Company was cut off for five days before the rest of the battalion was able to link up with it on 16&nbsp;February. Of the 250 or so men in the battalion before the battle, 119 were killed or wounded by the time the Japanese withdrew on 17&nbsp;February. Although the men had fought well, there were bitter recriminations over the conduct of the battle between the commander of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the 10th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which resulted in Butler being sacked. After reaching Mandalay, the battalion returned to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|title=The End of the War in South-East Asia&nbsp;\u2013 Soldiers of Gloucestershire|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024095433/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1945/05/18/the-end-of-the-war-in-south-east-asia/|archive-date=2017-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Daniell pp. 320\u2013324</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nThe regiment accrued 20 different battle honours and lost 870 men killed in the nine battalions that had served under its colours during the Second World War.

That same year, the 1st Battalion was reduced to a cadre and returned from India to the UK, and the 2nd Battalion was posted to Jamaica and detached companies to Bermuda and British Honduras (modern day Belize). It was in Jamaica that, in accordance with the restructuring of the British Army, the regiment's two battalions swapped colours and amalgamated to form the single-battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21&nbsp;September 1948.<ref>Daniell pp. 325\u2013331</ref>\n\n==Korean War==\n[[File:Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Gloucestershire Regiment at the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nAfter its return to the UK in 1949, the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[James Carne]], was assigned to the [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group]], and on 3&nbsp;November 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the battalion arrived with the brigade in Korea.

On the first day of the battle, UN forces fell back to Line Kansas, but both the Koreans and the British were already on Line Kansas, and did not have as much leeway to fall back. Later in the war an entire division would be allocated to the same frontage as the 29th Brigade were required to hold.<ref>Salmon pp. 127\u2013128, 309\u2013310</ref>}} The battalion's second-in-command, Major Digby Grist, was with rear headquarters (\"F echelon\") some {{convert|5|mi|km|0|spell=on}} behind, on route Five Yankee (5Y) to Seoul.<ref>Daniell p. 348</ref><ref>Salmon p. 175</ref> There was a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|0}} gap between the Glosters and the 1st Battalion [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] on their right, and on their left the 12th Regiment of the South Korean (ROK) [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Infantry Division]] was {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away.<ref>Mossman p. 385</ref>\n\nAfter nightfall on 22&nbsp;April, the Chinese launched the [[Chinese Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]], the first phase of which was designed to eliminate the US 3rd Division, the 29th Brigade and the ROK 1st Division. Success would allow them to attack the US 24th and 25th Divisions in the flank and leave the way open to Seoul. Against the four battalions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the [[63rd Army (People's Republic of China)|63rd Army]], comprising the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; some 27,000 men in 27 infantry battalions.<ref>Salmon pp. 128\u2013129</ref>\n\n====First night&nbsp;\u2013 attacks on A and D Companies and the F echelon====\n\nAt 22:00, a 17-man patrol from C Company in position on the river bank, supported by the guns of the 45th Field Regiment, engaged the leading Chinese troops three times as they attempted to cross the ford. The patrol withdrew without loss when it began to run out of ammunition, and the assaulting troops finally gained the opposite bank.<ref>Salmon pp. 1\u20136</ref> During the night, the Glosters' forward companies were attacked, and by 07:30, A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, and the company, now at less than half strength and with all officers killed or wounded, fell back to Hill 235. The withdrawal left D Company's position exposed and, with one of its platoons badly mauled in the overnight fighting, it too retired to the hill.<ref>Salmon pp. 151\u2013157</ref> Company B had not been pressed during the night, but the withdrawal of D Company on its left and the Fusiliers on its right left the company exposed, and it fell back to Hill 314, {{convert|800|yd|m}} east of C Company.<ref>Salmon pp. 166, 168.

He drove back along route 5Y, through an ambush and past a group of F echelon troops lining the road under Chinese guard, eventually reaching the brigade HQ. The loss of the F echelon position meant that the battalion was now cut off.<ref>Salmon pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\n====Second night&nbsp;\u2013 attacks on Hill 314====\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=20%\n|quote=What I must make clear to you is that my command is no longer an effective fighting force.

Through the night the men of B Company, led by Major Edgar Harding and outnumbered 18:1, endured six assaults, calling in artillery on their own position to break up the last of them. Low on ammunition and having taken many casualties, the company was forced from its position by the seventh assault at 08:10, and just 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which the battalion HQ, Support and C Companies had already withdrawn.<ref>Salmon pp. 176\u2013184</ref>{{efn|Accounts of C Company's action at Hill 314 during the night of 23/24 April are contradictory. Battalion adjutant Captain Farrar-Hockley, B Company commander Major Harding and Private David Green, who fought with C Company, all state in their books that the company was subject to a strong attack and ordered to withdraw during the night, and Daniell, p. 351, states that only a third of the company reached Hill 235. Lieutenant Temple and Private Coombes, both of C Company, state that the company was not subject to any major attack, and Temple states that, in the absence of the company commander, who went missing sometime during the night, he ordered the company to withdraw after daybreak on his own initiative.<ref>Salmon p. 180</ref>}} With the Glosters' position still vital to the integrity of Line Kansas, Carne received orders at 07:00 on 24&nbsp;April from the 3rd Division commander, General [[Robert H. Soule|Soule]], to stand his ground. He was advised that reinforcements, comprising tanks of the 8th Hussars and Philippine [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea|10th Battalion Combat Team]] and the troops of the Glosters' own rear echelon, were being sent up route 5Y.<ref name=\"Salmon p. 187\">Salmon p. 187</ref> The armour got to within {{convert|2000|yd|m}} of the Glosters' position before being halted in an ambush around 15:00, condemning the Glosters to another night alone on Hill 235.<ref>Salmon p. 187\u2013190, 308</ref>{{efn|Some accounts state that the armoured column was being sent to relieve the Glosters on Hill 235, that Carne was given permission to withdraw to meet it two hours after being ordered to remain in position, and that, unwilling to abandon his wounded, he elected to remain and await its arrival. Carne, however, had expressed doubts to his brigade commander during the battle that the force was sufficiently strong to reach him, and later stated that he was not given the option to withdraw on 24&nbsp;April and that it was his understanding that the armoured column was being sent to reinforce rather than relieve him.<ref name=\"Salmon p. 187\">Salmon p. 187</ref>}}\n\n====Third night&nbsp;\u2013 last stand on Hill 235====\n\n[[File:Gloster Hill.jpg|thumb|upright|Gloster Hill (Hill 235) five weeks after the Battle of the Imjin River]]\nBy the afternoon of 24&nbsp;April, the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery now fighting alongside as infantry, had been reduced to an effective fighting force of 400\u2013450 men. They were low on ammunition, though in their favour the 45th Field Regiment were still able to provide support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments).<ref>Salmon pp. 129, 203\u2013206</ref> The Glosters fought through the night of 24\u201325&nbsp;April, during which the peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill. It was recaptured in a counter-attack led by the [[adjutant]], Captain [[Anthony Farrar-Hockley]], and the Chinese launched seven attacks in one hour in an attempt to take it again, all without success. Their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with the 45th Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support. Carne received permission to attempt a breakout at 06:05. He had no choice but to leave the wounded, estimated at some 100. The survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.<ref>Salmon pp. 206\u2013225</ref>\n\n====After the battle====\n\nThe Glosters' stand had plugged a large gap in the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would otherwise have left the flanks of the ROK 1st and US 3rd Divisions vulnerable. Their presence also threatened the rear of the Chinese forces as they advanced and denied them the use of routes south for their artillery and mule trains. General [[James Van Fleet]], commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]], described the stand as \"the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war\",<ref name=salmon-quotes>Salmon p. 314</ref> and in a letter to General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgeway]], commander-in-chief of UN forces in Korea, he wrote that \"the loss of 622 officers and men saved many times that number\".<ref name=salmon-quotes /> The 29th Brigade commander, Brigadier [[Thomas Brodie]], christened the regiment ''The Glorious Glosters'', a sobriquet that was repeated in the headlines of the day, and Hill 235 became known as ''Gloster Hill'', at the foot of which the [[Gloucester Valley Battle Monument]] was built in 1957.<ref>Salmon p. 307</ref><ref name=imjin /><ref>Daniell p. 375</ref>\n\nThe other battalions of the 29th Brigade had also been engaged in desperate fighting, though without the same scale of losses, and in total the brigade suffered 1,091 casualties. Of the Glosters' 622 casualties, 56 were killed and 522 were taken prisoner, some of whom had already endured the POW camps of Germany and Japan.<ref>Salmon p. 262</ref><ref name=trials>{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1953/05/18/the-trials-and-release-of-the-p-o-ws-imjin-river/|title=The Trials and Release of the P.O.Ws&nbsp;\u2013 Imjin River|publisher=Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum|accessdate=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025021839/http://www.soldiersofglos.com/1953/05/18/the-trials-and-release-of-the-p-o-ws-imjin-river/|archive-date=2017-10-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> Carne, himself taken POW and already a recipient of the DSO for his leadership during the earlier battle at Hill 327, was awarded the VC and the American [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].

The Korean War accounted for 113 fatalities among the Glosters, 36 of them in captivity.<ref>Daniell pp. 356, 358, 365, 427</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n[[File:Glosters colours.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Parading the colours at Catterick Garrison on Back Badge Day 1993]]\nWhile the Korean War continued, the regiment was engaged in more ceremonial affairs at home. It lined the route of King [[George VI|George VI's]] funeral procession on 15&nbsp;February 1952, and it was presented with its first colours at a ceremony in Gloucester on 26&nbsp;April, the two regular battalions having retained those of their predecessor regiments up to that point. On 2&nbsp;June 1953, 400 men from both the 1st and 5th Battalions took part in the procession at the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>Daniell pp. 360, 362\u2013364</ref> Between 1955 and 1994, the regiment returned to more martial duties, for the most part patrolling the shrinking [[British Empire]] with tours of duty in [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]],  [[Colony of Aden|Aden]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cyprus Emergency|Cyprus]], [[Belize]], [[Gibraltar]] and the African colonies of [[Swaziland]], [[Mauritius]], [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] and [[Basutoland]]. The regiment also participated in the British contribution to [[NATO]] in Germany, serving three tours with the [[British Army of the Rhine]] and two with the [[Berlin Infantry Brigade|British garrison in Berlin]], and between 1968 and 1991 it completed seven tours in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]], in which it lost five men killed.<ref>Daniell pp. 368\u2013406, 427</ref>\n\nIn March 1967, the 1st Battalion became the sole unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment when, as a result of a reorganisation of the TA, the 5th Battalion became A Company of the Wessex Volunteers in the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The regiment narrowly avoided amalgamation with the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]] in 1970, and it celebrated its tercentenary in early March 1994; 300 years since the raising of Gibson's Regiment of Foot. But by that time, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] had prompted the government to [[Options for Change|restructure the armed forces]]. As a result, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] to form the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]. The new regiment maintained the back badge tradition, and when it was in turn amalgamated in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor regiment, [[The Rifles]], who wear the back badge with their ceremonial uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glosters.org/bbadge.htm|title=RGBW Regimental Association|publisher=Glosters RGBW Regimental Association|accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/5127944.stm|title=Back Badge survives second merger|date=2006-06-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Glosters paraded for the last time on 26&nbsp;March 1994 in Gloucester.

The first two games in the series, ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Beyond Castle Wolfenstein]]'', were developed by Muse Software and focused on [[Stealth game|stealth-based gameplay]] from a [[top-down perspective]]. Beginning with id Software's ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Wolfenstein'' games became fast-paced [[first-person shooter]]s, and are widely regarded to have helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. Further games in the series include ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', developed by [[Gray Matter Interactive]], ''[[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]]'' by [[Splash Damage]], and 2009's ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' by [[Raven Software]]. After [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired id Software, including the ''Wolfenstein'' franchise, Swedish developer [[MachineGames]] became the series' primary developer. ''Wolfenstein'' games developed by MachineGames include ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.\n\nThe majority of the games follow [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], a Jewish Polish-American Army Captain and his fights against the [[Axis powers]]. Earlier titles are centered around Nazis attempting to harness supernatural and occult forces. Those developed by MachineGames are set in an [[alternate history]] in which Axis powers won World War II.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=May 2014}}\n[[Image:Wolfenstein The New Order combat.png|thumb|250px|left|The series presents an action-heavy take on the fight against Nazi Germany.|alt=The first-person view of the player character, atop a destroyed bridge, shooting a Nazi with his machine gun.]]\n\nThe ''Wolfenstein'' series of video games started with the 1981 stealth-adventure video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. It was developed by American programmer [[Silas Warner]], a pioneer in the early eras of video gaming, especially the [[stealth game|stealth]] genre. It was published by his then company [[Muse Software|M.U.S.E. Inc.]] (Muse Software). Set during World War II, the game focuses on an unnamed American [[prisoner of war]] who has been imprisoned in the German stronghold of Castle Wolfenstein. The objective is to retrieve the war plans for Operation Rheingold and escape the fortress, while avoiding or killing guards along the way. The game is often credited as one of the first video games of the stealth genre, since it focuses more on avoiding or disarming enemies, and killing them is considered a last resort.<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sneaky-history-of-stealth-games/</ref>\n\nTen more titles, ''[[Beyond Castle Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Spear of Destiny'', ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' have been published as games of the ''Wolfenstein'' series since the release of ''Castle Wolfenstein'' in 1981 by M.U.S.E.

company [[Muse Software]], was a pioneer of early video game development, especially the stealth genre.<ref>https://games.greggman.com/game/silas_warner/</ref> He had access to computers in college, and when he worked for the IBM Mainframe architectures before joining Muse Software. The computer he used for game-development, P.L.A.T.O., was one of the first with multiple functioning terminals and an example of early computer networks. Warner developed, with P.L.A.T.O., a series of classic video games like his flight simulator and arcade shooter. Inspired by the arcade shooter video game ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' and the 1961 war film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|Guns of Navarone]]'', he developed ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', a stealth-adventure video game in which the player controls an unnamed American prisoner of war as he steals German files containing secret war plans, while avoiding, disarming or at times killing hostile guards and trying to escape the fortified Nazi stronghold 'Castle Wolfenstein', set in World War II. The game was published in 1981 by Warner's company M.U.S.E. Inc. (Muse Software).<ref>https://www.retrogames.cz/play_580-DOS.php?language=EN</ref>\n\n===''Beyond Castle Wolfenstein'' (1984)===\n{{Main|Beyond Castle Wolfenstein}}\n\nA sequel to ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the F\u00fchrer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the [[20 July Plot|July 20 Plot]].\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is a combination of action-adventure and stealth-based side-scroller, developed and published by Muse Software, and released in 1984. After the death of the original designer of the program,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/programming-pioneer-silas-warner-dies/1100-6091777/|title=Programming pioneer Silas Warner dies|date=2004-03-18|publisher=Gamespot}}</ref> the widow of Silas Warner released a ported version of the game, as well as its reconstructed source code in his honour in 2004.\n\n===''Wolfenstein 3D'' (1992)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein 3D}}\n\nAfter the Nazis apprehend an American spy, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, who was sent to sabotage the enemy's regime and foil their schemes, they imprison him under the grounds of Castle Wolfenstein. Finding a way to incapacitate a prison guard, B.J. manages to arm himself with a stolen pistol and advance through the subterranean floors of the castle, on his way to accomplish his mission by uncovering the truth behind 'Operation Eisenfaust' and destroy it.\n\nThe game is noted for popularizing the [[first-person shooter]] genre, released in 1992, developed by [[id Software]] and published by [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]].\n\n===''Spear of Destiny'' (1992)===\n{{Main|Spear of Destiny (video game)}}\n\nSet before the events of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player assumes the role of William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, who is set to reclaim the [[Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles. The spear itself, as spoken by legends, bears powerful effects on its own, and whoever took a hold of it, turns into an unbeatable being.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is developed by id Software, but published by [[FormGen Corporation]] instead, and was released in 1992.\n\n===''Return to Castle Wolfenstein'' (2001)===\n{{Main|Return to Castle Wolfenstein}}\n\nTwo operatives of an allied espionage agency, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and Agent One are captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein during their attempt to investigate rumours surrounding one of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s personal projects, the [[Occultism in Nazism|SS Paranormal Division]]. Agent One is killed during the interrogation, while Blazkowicz escapes custody, fighting his way out of the castle. As the challenge is still afoot, Blazkowicz discovers that the Nazis are constructing a plan called 'Operation Resurrection', which oversees resurrecting the dead as well as dealing with supernatural elements, using them for their own advantage to win World War II against the Allied power.\n\nA reboot and a remake of the series that took off in 1992, developed by [[Gray Matter Interactive]] and published by [[Activision]], and released in 2001 on Microsoft Windows, as well as arriving on consoles two years later.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory'' (2003)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory}}\n\nOriginally planned to be released as an expansion pack to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', the game was instead released as a standalone, free to play multiplayer title. It has no storyline or single-player campaign mode. Instead, it has an expanded edition of the previous game's multiplayer. It was developed by [[Splash Damage]] and published by Activision. A commercial follow-up, called ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' was released in 2007 by the same group.\n\n===''Wolfenstein RPG'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein RPG}}\n\nIn a mission to investigate the Paranormal Division of the Axis military, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz is captured and held prisoner in The Tower. He escapes the clutches of the enemy forces, and sets himself to stop them and their operation that involves supernatural activities once and for all, infiltrating Castle Wolfenstein to continue his escapade deep inside. It is up to B.J. to defeat the evil and save the world.\n\nIt was developed by Fountainhead Entertainment, and published by [[EA Mobile]] in 2008, with [[John Carmack]], one of the key people of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', reprising his role as the sole programmer.\n\n===''Wolfenstein'' (2009)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein (2009 video game)}}\n\nA loose sequel to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and the start of a new era for the franchise. An agent for the fictional Office of Secret Actions, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, discovers an unnatural medallion containing supernatural powers while on a mission on a German battleship. Learning the Nazis had begun digging deep into crystal mines to obtain more of the very same medallion Blazkowicz found, the OSA sends their operative to the fictional town of Isenstadt, which the Nazis had taken complete control of in order to excavate rare Nachtsonne crystals necessary to access the \"Black Sun\" dimension.\n\nIt was developed by [[Raven Software]], produced by id Software and published by [[Activision]], and released in 2009 on three major platforms.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: The New Order'' (2014)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: The New Order}}\n\n''The New Order'' is set after the end of World War II, in an alternate universe where the Axis powers won World War II. In 1946, as the Nazis expand their regime all over the world, OSA agent William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz is sent to assassinate General Deathshead, as part of a last all-out effort by Allied airborne and commando forces. The mission is a failure and, after the unit is slaughtered by the Nazi forces, Blazkowicz barely escapes the compound, sustaining a critical head injury which renders him unconscious and subsequently puts him in a coma.\n\nIn 1960, fourteen years later, B.J. finds himself settled in an asylum, unaware of the events that took place during his coma, and about to be executed by the Nazis who have ordered the asylum liquidated. Awakened into full strength, Blazkowicz fights his way out of the building, escaping with a wounded nurse, Anya. B.J. locates the Resistance and helps them fight the Nazis, dismantling them and ultimately crippling their dominance around the world.\n\nAfter Activision handed over the publishing rights to [[Bethesda Softworks]], development on the game began in 2010 by [[MachineGames]], and was released four years later on multiple platforms, including next generation consoles.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: The Old Blood}}\n\nA prequel to ''The New Order'', set in the same chronology, it deals with William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and Richard Wesley, also known as Agent One, who are sent to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder that contains the whereabouts of General Deathshead. The mission goes awry as they are discovered by the Nazi troopers and are captured. During brutal interrogation, Agent One is killed, but Blazkowicz manages to evade the Nazi forces and escape the castle.\n\nWith the aid of Kessler, the leader of a local resistance group, he discovers that the folder is held by Helga von Schabbs, a Nazi neurologist who has just arrived in the village of Wulfburg.  Evidence begins to emerge of supernatural activities taking place under the command of von Schabbs, who is conducting an archaeological excavation in an attempt to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by German King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]].\n\nThe game is a loose remake of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', with heavy resemblances noticed within the storylines of the two games, as well as the existence of various characters as homages to the ones from the older title. Developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks, the game serves as a stand-alone expansion pack to ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', and was released in 2015.\n\n===''Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus}}\n\nSet five months after the events of ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order|The New Order]]'', \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz awakens from the coma he succumbed to in the aftermath of surviving a near-fatal explosion, residing on a stolen Nazi U-boat commandeered by the Wiesenau Kreis. After an attack ensues on the base orchestrated by Frau Engel, many of the resistance members are captured, and the leader of the group is killed. Escaping the clutches of Nazi forces with the rest of the team, Blazkowicz takes over the leadership of the Resistance and proceeds to what would have been the next step in the plan to liberate America from the Nazis and use the country as a center base to free the rest of the world from their behemoth and monstrous regime. Recruiting new members to the resistance along the way, Blazkowicz and the group intend to assassinate prominent leaders in the Nazi regime to bring the public conscious into the idea of liberty and freedom, thus urging everyone to rise against the hefty powers who are running the government. But, before they ignite the operation, the resistance must attack and take over Engel's airship, the Ausmerzer, to disable its use against their own by the Nazis, and hijack its command systems in order to start a revolution, thus reclaiming the land of freedom that was once theirs.\n\nLike its two predecessors, ''The New Colossus'' is developed by [[MachineGames]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]], as well as released on multiple platforms in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-announced-with-release-date |title=E3 2017: Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus Announced With Release Date |last=Otero |first=Jose |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=June 11, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6r9nPOWlC?url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-announced-with-release-date |archivedate=June 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein: Youngblood'' (2019) ===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: Youngblood}}\n\nTwo decades after liberating the United States from the Nazis occupation in the [[Second American Revolution]] in 1961, the newest members of the Global Resistance, twin sisters Jessica and Sophia Blazkowicz embark on a search mission to France in the capital city of [[Paris]] when B.J., their father, goes missing in action.

The first two games in the series, ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Beyond Castle Wolfenstein]]'', were developed by Muse Software and focused on [[Stealth game|stealth-based gameplay]] from a [[top-down perspective]]. Beginning with id Software's ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Wolfenstein'' games became fast-paced [[first-person shooter]]s, and are widely regarded to have helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. Further games in the series include ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', developed by [[Gray Matter Interactive]], ''[[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]]'' by [[Splash Damage]], and 2009's ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' by [[Raven Software]]. After [[ZeniMax Media]] acquired id Software, including the ''Wolfenstein'' franchise, Swedish developer [[MachineGames]] became the series' primary developer. ''Wolfenstein'' games developed by MachineGames include ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.\n\nThe majority of the games follow [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], a Jewish Polish-American Army Captain and his fights against the [[Axis powers]]. Earlier titles are centered around Nazis attempting to harness supernatural and occult forces. Those developed by MachineGames are set in an [[alternate history]] in which Axis powers won World War II.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=May 2014}}\n[[Image:Wolfenstein The New Order combat.png|thumb|250px|left|The series presents an action-heavy take on the fight against Nazi Germany.|alt=The first-person view of the player character, atop a destroyed bridge, shooting a Nazi with his machine gun.]]\n\nThe ''Wolfenstein'' series of video games started with the 1981 stealth-adventure video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. It was developed by American programmer [[Silas Warner]], a pioneer in the early eras of video gaming, especially the [[stealth game|stealth]] genre. It was published by his then company [[Muse Software|M.U.S.E. Inc.]] (Muse Software). Set during World War II, the game focuses on an unnamed American [[prisoner of war]] who has been imprisoned in the German stronghold of Castle Wolfenstein. The objective is to retrieve the war plans for Operation Rheingold and escape the fortress, while avoiding or killing guards along the way. The game is often credited as one of the first video games of the stealth genre, since it focuses more on avoiding or disarming enemies, and killing them is considered a last resort.<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sneaky-history-of-stealth-games/</ref>\n\nTen more titles, ''[[Beyond Castle Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Spear of Destiny'', ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein: The Old Blood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' have been published as games of the ''Wolfenstein'' series since the release of ''Castle Wolfenstein'' in 1981 by M.U.S.E.

company [[Muse Software]], was a pioneer of early video game development, especially the stealth genre.<ref>https://games.greggman.com/game/silas_warner/</ref> He had access to computers in college, and when he worked for the IBM Mainframe architectures before joining Muse Software. The computer he used for game-development, P.L.A.T.O., was one of the first with multiple functioning terminals and an example of early computer networks. Warner developed, with P.L.A.T.O., a series of classic video games like his flight simulator and arcade shooter. Inspired by the arcade shooter video game ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' and the 1961 war film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|Guns of Navarone]]'', he developed ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', a stealth-adventure video game in which the player controls an unnamed American prisoner of war as he steals German files containing secret war plans, while avoiding, disarming or at times killing hostile guards and trying to escape the fortified Nazi stronghold 'Castle Wolfenstein', set in World War II. The game was published in 1981 by Warner's company M.U.S.E. Inc. (Muse Software).<ref>https://www.retrogames.cz/play_580-DOS.php?language=EN</ref>\n\n===''Beyond Castle Wolfenstein'' (1984)===\n{{Main|Beyond Castle Wolfenstein}}\n\nA sequel to ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the F\u00fchrer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the [[20 July Plot|July 20 Plot]].\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is a combination of action-adventure and stealth-based side-scroller, developed and published by Muse Software, and released in 1984. After the death of the original designer of the program,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/programming-pioneer-silas-warner-dies/1100-6091777/|title=Programming pioneer Silas Warner dies|date=2004-03-18|publisher=Gamespot}}</ref> the widow of Silas Warner released a ported version of the game, as well as its reconstructed source code in his honour in 2004.\n\n===''Wolfenstein 3D'' (1992)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein 3D}}\n\nAfter the Nazis apprehend an American spy, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, who was sent to sabotage the enemy's regime and foil their schemes, they imprison him under the grounds of Castle Wolfenstein. Finding a way to incapacitate a prison guard, B.J. manages to arm himself with a stolen pistol and advance through the subterranean floors of the castle, on his way to accomplish his mission by uncovering the truth behind 'Operation Eisenfaust' and destroy it.\n\nThe game is noted for popularizing the [[first-person shooter]] genre, released in 1992, developed by [[id Software]] and published by [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]].\n\n===''Spear of Destiny'' (1992)===\n{{Main|Spear of Destiny (video game)}}\n\nSet before the events of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player assumes the role of William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, who is set to reclaim the [[Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles. The spear itself, as spoken by legends, bears powerful effects on its own, and whoever took a hold of it, turns into an unbeatable being.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is developed by id Software, but published by [[FormGen Corporation]] instead, and was released in 1992.\n\n===''Return to Castle Wolfenstein'' (2001)===\n{{Main|Return to Castle Wolfenstein}}\n\nTwo operatives of an allied espionage agency, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and Agent One are captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein during their attempt to investigate rumours surrounding one of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s personal projects, the [[Occultism in Nazism|SS Paranormal Division]]. Agent One is killed during the interrogation, while Blazkowicz escapes custody, fighting his way out of the castle. As the challenge is still afoot, Blazkowicz discovers that the Nazis are constructing a plan called 'Operation Resurrection', which oversees resurrecting the dead as well as dealing with supernatural elements, using them for their own advantage to win World War II against the Allied power.\n\nA reboot and a remake of the series that took off in 1992, developed by [[Gray Matter Interactive]] and published by [[Activision]], and released in 2001 on Microsoft Windows, as well as arriving on consoles two years later.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory'' (2003)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory}}\n\nOriginally planned to be released as an expansion pack to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', the game was instead released as a standalone, free to play multiplayer title. It has no storyline or single-player campaign mode. Instead, it has an expanded edition of the previous game's multiplayer. It was developed by [[Splash Damage]] and published by Activision. A commercial follow-up, called ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' was released in 2007 by the same group.\n\n===''Wolfenstein RPG'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein RPG}}\n\nIn a mission to investigate the Paranormal Division of the Axis military, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz is captured and held prisoner in The Tower. He escapes the clutches of the enemy forces, and sets himself to stop them and their operation that involves supernatural activities once and for all, infiltrating Castle Wolfenstein to continue his escapade deep inside. It is up to B.J. to defeat the evil and save the world.\n\nIt was developed by Fountainhead Entertainment, and published by [[EA Mobile]] in 2008, with [[John Carmack]], one of the key people of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', reprising his role as the sole programmer.\n\n===''Wolfenstein'' (2009)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein (2009 video game)}}\n\nA loose sequel to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and the start of a new era for the franchise. An agent for the fictional Office of Secret Actions, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, discovers an unnatural medallion containing supernatural powers while on a mission on a German battleship. Learning the Nazis had begun digging deep into crystal mines to obtain more of the very same medallion Blazkowicz found, the OSA sends their operative to the fictional town of Isenstadt, which the Nazis had taken complete control of in order to excavate rare Nachtsonne crystals necessary to access the \"Black Sun\" dimension.\n\nIt was developed by [[Raven Software]], produced by id Software and published by [[Activision]], and released in 2009 on three major platforms.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: The New Order'' (2014)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: The New Order}}\n\n''The New Order'' is set after the end of World War II, in an alternate universe where the Axis powers won World War II. In 1946, as the Nazis expand their regime all over the world, OSA agent William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz is sent to assassinate General Deathshead, as part of a last all-out effort by Allied airborne and commando forces. The mission is a failure and, after the unit is slaughtered by the Nazi forces, Blazkowicz barely escapes the compound, sustaining a critical head injury which renders him unconscious and subsequently puts him in a coma.\n\nIn 1960, fourteen years later, B.J. finds himself settled in an asylum, unaware of the events that took place during his coma, and about to be executed by the Nazis who have ordered the asylum liquidated. Awakened into full strength, Blazkowicz fights his way out of the building, escaping with a wounded nurse, Anya. B.J. locates the Resistance and helps them fight the Nazis, dismantling them and ultimately crippling their dominance around the world.\n\nAfter Activision handed over the publishing rights to [[Bethesda Softworks]], development on the game began in 2010 by [[MachineGames]], and was released four years later on multiple platforms, including next generation consoles.\n\n===''Wolfenstein: The Old Blood'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: The Old Blood}}\n\nA prequel to ''The New Order'', set in the same chronology, it deals with William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and Richard Wesley, also known as Agent One, who are sent to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder that contains the whereabouts of General Deathshead. The mission goes awry as they are discovered by the Nazi troopers and are captured. During brutal interrogation, Agent One is killed, but Blazkowicz manages to evade the Nazi forces and escape the castle.\n\nWith the aid of Kessler, the leader of a local resistance group, he discovers that the folder is held by Helga von Schabbs, a Nazi neurologist who has just arrived in the village of Wulfburg.  Evidence begins to emerge of supernatural activities taking place under the command of von Schabbs, who is conducting an archaeological excavation in an attempt to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by German King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]].\n\nThe game is a loose remake of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', with heavy resemblances noticed within the storylines of the two games, as well as the existence of various characters as homages to the ones from the older title. Developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks, the game serves as a stand-alone expansion pack to ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', and was released in 2015.\n\n===''Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus}}\n\nSet five months after the events of ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order|The New Order]]'', \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz awakens from the coma he succumbed to in the aftermath of surviving a near-fatal explosion, residing on a stolen Nazi U-boat commandeered by the Wiesenau Kreis. After an attack ensues on the base orchestrated by Frau Engel, many of the resistance members are captured, and the leader of the group is killed. Escaping the clutches of Nazi forces with the rest of the team, Blazkowicz takes over the leadership of the Resistance and proceeds to what would have been the next step in the plan to liberate America from the Nazis and use the country as a center base to free the rest of the world from their behemoth and monstrous regime. Recruiting new members to the resistance along the way, Blazkowicz and the group intend to assassinate prominent leaders in the Nazi regime to bring the public conscious into the idea of liberty and freedom, thus urging everyone to rise against the hefty powers who are running the government. But, before they ignite the operation, the resistance must attack and take over Engel's airship, the Ausmerzer, to disable its use against their own by the Nazis, and hijack its command systems in order to start a revolution, thus reclaiming the land of freedom that was once theirs.\n\nLike its two predecessors, ''The New Colossus'' is developed by [[MachineGames]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]], as well as released on multiple platforms in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-announced-with-release-date |title=E3 2017: Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus Announced With Release Date |last=Otero |first=Jose |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=June 11, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6r9nPOWlC?url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-announced-with-release-date |archivedate=June 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Wolfenstein: Youngblood'' (2019) ===\n{{Main|Wolfenstein: Youngblood}}\n\nTwo decades after liberating the United States from the Nazis occupation in the [[Second American Revolution]] in 1961, the newest members of the Global Resistance, twin sisters Jessica and Sophia Blazkowicz embark on a search mission to France in the capital city of [[Paris]] when B.J., their father, goes missing in action.

Shortly after Jesse's death in 1853, the song was modified to support Lincoln's presidency.  The song was last sung by the Hutchinson Family at the 1892 dedication for the statue of John P. Hale. [[Frederick Douglass]] also was present and sang with the Hutchinson Family.\n\nThe song expresses themes of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and [[log cabin]] virtues, with the chorus also expansively establishing Lincoln as a [[favorite son]] of three states ([[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]]).

[[Frederick Douglass]] also was present and sung with the Hutchinson Family.\n\nThe song expresses themes of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and [[log cabin]] virtues, with the chorus also expansively establishing Lincoln as a [[favorite son]] of three states ([[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]]).

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996).

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:\n# Antigen\tA\twith antibody  B\n# Antigen\tB\twith antibody  A\n# Antigen\tAB\thas no antibodies\n# Antigen \tnil (group O) with antibody A and B.\n\nThere is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.\n\nThe ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. It has been hypothesized that ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es, although blood group compatibility rules are applied to newborn and infants as a matter of practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Position statement: Red blood cell transfusion in newborn infants |url=https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/red-blood-cell-transfusion-newborn-infants |publisher=Canadian Pediatric Society |date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications \"C\" became \"O\".<ref name=Oor0>{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner \u2013 Blood Group 'O' or Blood Group 'NULL' | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206\u20138 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}</ref> Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.<ref name=\"Oor0\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&nbsp;\u2013 a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Phenotype]]\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Genotype]]\n|-\n| A  || AA or AI\n|-\n| B  || BB or BI\n|-\n| AB || AB\n|-\n| O  || II\n|}\n\n===Rh blood group system===\n{{Main|Rh blood group system}}\nThe Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.<ref name=\"Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510\u20131\">{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath|url-access=registration|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath/page/510 510\u20131]|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}</ref> [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164\u201376|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}</ref> Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).<ref name=\"Rh group and its origin\">{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh\u8840\u578b\u7684\u7531\u4f86|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>\nThe presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or \u2212 sign, so that, for example, the A\u2212 group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.\n\n===ABO and Rh distribution by country===\n{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}\n\nAs with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.\n\n===Other blood group systems===\n{{Main|Human blood group systems}}\nTwenty-eight blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=news&storyID=13259\n|title=Blood Mystery Solved\n|author=Joshua E.

For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive ([[MNS antigen system|MNS system]]), K positive ([[Kell antigen system|Kell system]]), Le<sup>a</sup> or Le<sup>b</sup> negative ([[Lewis antigen system|Lewis system]]), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Blood transfusion===\n{{Main|Blood transfusion}}\nTransfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.\n\n[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society.

Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08</ref>]]\n\nMuch of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[kidney failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\n\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].\n\nThe blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].\n\nRare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738\u201342 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}</ref> and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.

If a patient needs an urgent blood transfusion, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued. Because it is compatible with anyone, O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply.<ref name=\"AABBfive\">{{Citation |author1 = American Association of Blood Banks |author1-link = American Association of Blood Banks |date = 24 April 2014 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Association of Blood Banks |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page =  |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-association-of-blood-banks/ |accessdate = 25 July 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140924075027/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-association-of-blood-banks/ |archive-date = 24 September 2014 |url-status = dead }}, which cites\n*{{cite web|author1=The Chief Medical Officer's National Blood Transfusion Committee|title=The appropriate use of group O RhD negative red cells|url=http://hospital.blood.co.uk/library/pdf/nbtc_bbt_o_neg_red_cells_recs_09_04.pdf|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=25 July 2014|year=c. 2008}}</ref> According to the American Association of Blood Banks and the British Chief Medical Officer's National Blood Transfusion Committee, the use of group O RhD negative red cells should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, women who might be pregnant, and emergency cases in which blood-group testing is genuinely impracticable.<ref name=\"AABBfive\"/>\n\n[[Image:Blood Compatibility.svg|right|230px|thumb|'''Red blood cell compatibility chart'''<br />In addition to donating to the same blood group; type O blood donors can give to A, B and AB; blood donors of types A and B can give to AB.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Red blood cell compatibility table<!--\n --><ref name=rbccomp>{{cite web |url=http://chapters.redcross.org/br/northernohio/INFO/bloodtype.html |title=RBC compatibility table |accessdate=2008-07-15 |date=December 2006 |publisher=American National Red Cross |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913165654/http://chapters.redcross.org/br/northernohio/info/bloodtype.html |archivedate=2008-09-13 |df= }}</ref><ref name=bloodbook>[http://www.bloodbook.com/compat.html Blood types and compatibility] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419103919/http://www.bloodbook.com/compat.html |date=2010-04-19 }} bloodbook.com</ref><!--\n -->\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Recipient<sup>[1]</sup>\n! colspan=\"8\" | Donor<sup>[1]</sup>\n|-\n!

If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.\n\nThis same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.\n\n===Plasma compatibility===\n[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''<br />In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]\n[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma.

If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Universal donors and universal recipients===\n[[File:US Navy 060105-N-8154G-010 A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from Portsmouth Naval Hospital takes samples of blood from a donor for testing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth]] takes samples of blood from a donor for testing]]\n\nIn transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald |author3=Kurt J.

In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.\n\nAdditionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.\n\nFor transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.\n\n==Blood typing==\n{{main|Blood typing}}\nTypically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |volume= 53 |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G|pmid= 27966700 | pages=1793\u201396}}</ref>  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.\n\n===Blood group genotyping===\nIn addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248\u201356|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5eef89dbbf7a0f33accfc2633d39868143ada4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBlood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, [[Karl Landsteiner]], working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that, some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357\u2013362 |year=1900}}</ref> He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\n{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals.

The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5\u20138 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132\u20131134}}</ref> This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:\n# Antigen\tA\twith antibody  B\n# Antigen\tB\twith antibody  A\n# Antigen\tAB\thas no antibodies\n# Antigen \tnil (group O) with antibody A and B.\n\nThere is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.\n\nThe ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. It has been hypothesized that ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es, although blood group compatibility rules are applied to newborn and infants as a matter of practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Position statement: Red blood cell transfusion in newborn infants |url=https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/red-blood-cell-transfusion-newborn-infants |publisher=Canadian Pediatric Society |date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications \"C\" became \"O\".<ref name=Oor0>{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner \u2013 Blood Group 'O' or Blood Group 'NULL' | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206\u20138 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}</ref> Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.<ref name=\"Oor0\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&nbsp;\u2013 a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Phenotype]]\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|[[Genotype]]\n|-\n| A  || AA or AI\n|-\n| B  || BB or BI\n|-\n| AB || AB\n|-\n| O  || II\n|}\n\n===Rh blood group system===\n{{Main|Rh blood group system}}\nThe Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.<ref name=\"Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510\u20131\">{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath|url-access=registration|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsinmic00kath/page/510 510\u20131]|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}</ref> [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164\u201376|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}</ref> Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).<ref name=\"Rh group and its origin\">{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh\u8840\u578b\u7684\u7531\u4f86|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>\nThe presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or \u2212 sign, so that, for example, the A\u2212 group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.\n\n===ABO and Rh distribution by country===\n{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}\n\nAs with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.\n\n===Other blood group systems===\n{{Main|Human blood group systems}}\nTwenty-eight blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=news&storyID=13259\n|title=Blood Mystery Solved\n|author=Joshua E.

Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Blood transfusion===\n{{Main|Blood transfusion}}\nTransfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.\n\n[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society.

Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08</ref>]]\n\nMuch of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[kidney failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\n\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].\n\nThe blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].\n\nRare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738\u201342 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}</ref> and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.

If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.\n\nThis same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.\n\n===Plasma compatibility===\n[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''<br />In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]\n[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma.

If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Universal donors and universal recipients===\n[[File:US Navy 060105-N-8154G-010 A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from Portsmouth Naval Hospital takes samples of blood from a donor for testing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth]] takes samples of blood from a donor for testing]]\n\nIn transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald |author3=Kurt J.

In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.\n\nAdditionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.\n\nFor transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.\n\n==Blood typing==\n{{main|Blood typing}}\nTypically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |volume= 53 |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G|pmid= 27966700 | pages=1793\u201396}}</ref>  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.\n\n===Blood group genotyping===\nIn addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248\u201356|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5eef89dbbf7a0f33accfc2633d39868143ada4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBlood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, [[Karl Landsteiner]], working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that, some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357\u2013362 |year=1900}}</ref> He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\n{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals.

The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5\u20138 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132\u20131134}}</ref> This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.
