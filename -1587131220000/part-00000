Instead of individual behaviors, it targets pivotal areas of a child's development, such as motivation, responsivity to multiple cues, self-management, and social initiations; it aims for widespread improvements in areas that are not specifically targeted. The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange. Intended attempts at the target behavior are rewarded with a natural reinforcer: for example, if a child attempts a request for a stuffed animal, the child receives the animal, not a piece of candy or other unrelated reinforcer.<ref>Pivotal response therapy:\n*{{vcite book |title=Pivotal Response Treatments for Autism: Communication, Social, & Academic Development |author=Koegel RL, Koegel LK |publisher=Brookes |isbn=1-55766-819-1 |date=2006 }}\n*{{vcite journal |journal=Journal of the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps|year=1999 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=174\u201385 |title=Pivotal response intervention I: overview of approach |author=Koegel LK, Koegel RL, Harrower JK, Carter CM |doi=10.2511/rpsd.24.3.174 }}</ref>\n\n====Aversive therapy====\nThe [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]] uses [[aversion therapy]], notably contingent shock ([[electric shock]] delivered to the skin for a few seconds), to control the behavior of its patients, many of whom are autistic.

They do not know how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.\n\nCommunication interventions fall into two major categories.

Brookes|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-1-55766-818-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> is an educational model for working with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was designed to help families, educators and therapists work cooperatively together to maximize progress in supporting the child.\n\nThe acronym refers to the focus on:\n\n* SC \u2013 social communication \u2013 the development of functional communication and emotional expression.\n* ER \u2013 emotional regulation \u2013 the development of well-regulated emotions and ability to cope with stress.\n* TS \u2013 transactional support \u2013 the implementation of supports to help families, educators and therapists respond to children's needs, adapt the environment and provide tools to enhance learning.\n\nThe evidence base for the efficacy of the SCERTS Model Practice in the SCERTS model is based on evidence from multiple sources. Efficacy of implementation of practices in the SCERTS Model is supported by empirical evidence from contemporary treatment research in ASD and related disabilities. Currently, federally funded, large sample research has been published and longitudinal studies continue that specifically addresses the effectiveness of SCERTS as a comprehensive treatment framework. The emphasis of current research is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SCERTS for infants, toddlers and school age students in home, school and community settings. This body of research is summarized below. Second, it is rooted in research on child development as well as research addressing the core challenges of ASD. Third, it incorporates the documentation of meaningful change through the collection of clinical and educational data, and programmatic decisions are made based on objective measurement of change. Finally, given that it is not an exclusive model, evidence-based practices (i.e., focused intervention strategies) from other approaches are easily infused in a program plan for an individual. \n\nEmpirical Research on the Efficacy of The SCERTS Model\n\nIn recent years a number of studies have been published that highlight the efficacy of the SCERTS model. Two randomized controlled trials have been published demonstrating the efficacy of the SCERTS Model in the home and classroom settings. The first randomized trial adapted the SCERTS framework for delivery within early intervention settings (Wetherby et al., 2014). Specifically, this study examined the effectiveness of the model when implemented by parents for toddlers with autism within natural settings.   Eighty-two autistic children aged 19 months (SD = 1.93 mos) participated in a 9-month longitudinal study with their primary caregiver.  Children were randomized into two groups \u2013 an individual coaching format and a group coaching format, both focused on teaching parents how to support active engagement within natural contexts using the SCERTS framework.  Individual coaching consisted of in-home support from an interventionist 2-3 times weekly using a collaborative coaching model to build parent capacity and independence in implementation of supports within natural routines geared at facilitating SC and ER development. Parents in this condition were encouraged to deliver intervention by embedding evidence-based strategies for their child\u2019s SC and ER targets in everyday activities for at least 25 hours. This is consistent with the SCERTS Model recommendations. Results found individual coaching was more efficacious than the group-based format.    Outcomes for social communication, receptive language, and adaptive behavior reached statistical significance (Wetherby et al., 2014). \n\nThe efficacy of the SCERTS Model in classrooms was the focus of another large longitudinal randomized control trial.  Morgan et al. (2018) conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial for 197 diverse students with ASD in 129 classrooms across 66 schools in the US.  Mean age of the students was 6.76 years (SD = 1.05years).  Classrooms were randomly assigned to the Classroom SCERTS Intervention (CSI) or Autism Training Modules (ATM) condition. Special education and general education teachers assigned to the CSI condition in this study were trained on the model and provided coaching throughout the school year.  ATM teachers engaged in usual school-based educational practices and had access to online training resources related to autism treatment practices.  Notably, in this study active engagement was used as an outcome measure and was measured by the Classroom Measure of Active Engagement (CMAE; Morgan, Wetherby & Holland, 2010). Additional outcome measures examining adaptive behavior, social skills, and ratings of executive functioning were also used.\n\nResults of Morgan et al. (2018) revealed that students in the CSI condition showed statistically significant better outcomes on observed measures of adaptive communication, social skills and executive functioning than students within the ATM condition.  These data demonstrate the positive impact of SCERTS within a natural environment, that is, the classroom setting, for a heterogeneous sample of students with ASD (Morgan et al., 2018).  This study was chosen by the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee in the US for their 2018 Summary of Advances in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research Report as a key study addressing the question \u201cWhich treatments and interventions will help?\u201d   In their review, the Committee highlighted that 70 percent of teachers trained in CSI implemented with fidelity indicating scalability of the model and also reflecting feasibility with teacher commitment to the model.  They also acknowledged that this is one of the largest studies to measure the effect of school-based active engagement intervention in children with ASD and that the results appear generalizable to a diverse population (Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), 2019). \n\nThe prioritization of active engagement as a measure of effectiveness for educational programs for students with ASD aligns with work by Sparapani and colleagues (2015) that identifies the challenges students diagnosed with autism face in terms of maintaining active engagement and the resulting impact on learning and educational outcomes.   In fact, results suggest typically students with autism actively engage less than half of the time in the classroom (Sparapani, Morgan, Reinhardt, Schatschneider, & Wetherby, 2015).  Consideration of this finding in the context of additional research suggests that increasing active engagement is critical to positive educational outcomes in ASD and reveals a clear need for approaches such as SCERTS that focus on active engagement (National Research Council, 2001).  \n\nThe SCERTS Model has also been the object of international study.  A pilot study was implemented in Hong Kong examining the effectiveness of the SCERTS\u00ae Model  for children with ASD (Yu & Zhu, 2018).  This study examined the implementation of SCERTS\u00ae for 2 different durations (5 months versus 10 months) for children with an average age of 53 months in preschool settings.  Special education teachers, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, and physiotherapists were recruited from 10 special child care centers in Hong Kong. Participating professionals received initial training and then were provided coaching throughout the school year. Each participating special education teacher taught 5-7 children.  Results showed that participating children improved significantly in their social communication and emotional behavior after intervention.  \n\nThe SCERTS Model has also been the subject of a multiple case study design (O\u2019Neill et al., 2010).  Implementation of SCERTS in this study followed a multi-disciplinary team training for the teams of four pupils. All four pupils made progress in Joint Attention, Symbol Use, Mutual Regulation, and Self-Regulation as well as in other measures of receptive communication, expressive communication, play, and coping skills.  Qualitative methods were used to gain insights from the staff related to their experiences in implementing SCERTS.  Central findings from the focus groups with the multidisciplinary team members revealed increased understanding of emotional regulation as a developmental construct, as well as increased clarity of team member roles in supporting children when dysregulated.  \n\nResearchers in the United Kingdom  (Molteni, Guldberg, & Logan, 2013) also examined the feasibility of implementing SCERTS as an ecologically valid model in an independent residential school.  This study aimed to understand how teams work together while learning to implement the SCERTS Model.  At the conclusion of the study, 89% of the team members said they felt comfortable using SCERTS and 78% said the framework improved teamwork in collaborating with colleagues. Specifically, teams highlighted that the quality and accuracy of assessment improved collaboration and understanding of students and their environment.   \n\nSummary\n\nThe SCERTS Model meets criteria for evidence-based practice and offers a framework to directly address the core challenges of ASD, focusing on building an individual\u2019s capacity to initiate communication with a conventional symbolic system and to be actively engaged in emotionally satisfying relationships based on effective reciprocal communication. Emotional regulation goals focus on capacities to regulate attention, arousal and emotional state to cope with everyday stresses in life, and therefore, to be most available for learning and engaging.  Transactional supports are identified, developed and implemented to support individuals of all ages in social engagement and learning, to promote generalization of acquired abilities, and to support their caregivers service providers.  The model provides a roadmap for individualized education and treatment based on a person\u2019s strengths and needs guided by research on child and human development. The SCERTS Model was designed to motivate professionals and families to focus their efforts on enhancing quality of life by addressing the core challenges faced by autistic children, adults and their caregivers, and therefore, to move the field to a new generation of more integrated, comprehensive programs. \n\nDisley, B.

This approach is based on the idea that the core deficits in autism are individual differences in the [[sensory system]], [[motor planning]] problems, difficulties in communication and relation to others, and the inability to connect ones desire to intentional action and communication. When addressed through a combination of sensory support and DIR/Floortime techniques, the facilitator is playfully obstructive to redirect the child to play and relate to their therapist. The primary goal of Floortime is to improve the child's cognitive, language, and social abilities.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFlFAwAAQBAJ | title=Handbook of Early Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders | publisher=Springer Science+Business Media | author=Tarbox, Jonathan | year=2014 | pages=411| isbn=9781493904013 }}</ref> However, these claims should be regarded with some scepticism, owing to a lack of independent scientific research into the efficacy of the floortime approach.\n\nThe DIR model is based on the model of a developmental 'tree', the central notion being that Autistic children have yet to master certain early developmental milestones, or 'branches' of the tree, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Stage One: Regulation and Interest in the World''': Being calm and feeling well enough to attend to a caregiver and surroundings. Have shared attention.\n*'''Stage Two: Engagement and Relating''': Interest in another person and in the world, developing a special bond with preferred caregivers. Distinguishing inanimate objects from people.\n*'''Stage Three: Two way intentional communication''': Simple back and forth interactions between child and caregiver. Smiles, tickles, anticipatory play.\n*'''Stage Four: Social Problem solving''': Using gestures, interaction, babble to indicate needs, wants, pleasure, upset. Get a caregiver to help with a problem. Using pre-language skills to show intention.\n*'''Stage Five: Symbolic Play''': Using words, pictures, symbols to communicate an intention, idea. Communicate ideas and thoughts, not just wants and needs.\n*'''Stage Six: Bridging Ideas''': This stage is the foundation of logic, reasoning, emotional thinking and a sense of reality.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nExponents of the floortime approach argue that children with ASD struggle with or have missed some of these vital developmental stages.

Before implementing the home-based program, an institute trains the parents how to accept their child without judgment through a series of dialogue sessions. Like Floortime, parents join their child's ritualistic behavior for relationship-building. To gain the child's \"willing engagement\", the facilitator continues to join them only this time through parallel play. Proponents claim that children will become non-autistic after parents accept them for who they are and engage them in play. The program was started by the parents of [[Raun Kaufman]], who is claimed to have gone from being autistic to normal via the treatment in the early 1970s.<ref>{{vcite book |author=Kaufman BN |title=Son-Rise: the Miracle Continues |publisher=HJ Kramer |year=1995 |isbn=0-915811-61-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sonrise00barr }}</ref> No independent study has tested the efficacy of the program, but a 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time,<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research|year=2003 |volume=47 |issue=4\u20135 |pages=291\u20139 |title=The Son-Rise Program intervention for autism: an investigation into family experiences |author=Williams KR, Wishart JG |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2788.2003.00491.x |pmid=12787161 }}</ref> and a 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests it will be difficult to evaluate its efficacy.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |year=2006 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=86\u2013102 |title=The Son-Rise Program intervention for autism: prerequisites for evaluation |author=Williams KR |doi=10.1177/1362361306062012 |pmid=16522712 }}</ref>\n\n===TEACCH===\n{{Main|Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children}}\nTreatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), which has come to be called \"structured teaching\", emphasises structure by using organized physical environments, predictably sequenced activities, visual schedules and visually structured activities, and structured work/activity systems where each child can practice various tasks.<ref name=CCD/> Parents are taught to implement the treatment at home.

The treatment is repeated several times a week, and can continue for years. It is intended as treatment for autistic children who harm themselves; most of these children cannot speak. Similar envelopment techniques have been used for centuries, such as to calm violent patients in Germany in the 19th century; its modern use in France began in the 1960s, based on psychoanalytic theories such as the theory of the [[Refrigerator mother theory|refrigerator mother]]. Packing is currently used in hundreds of French clinics. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of packing, and some concern about risk of adverse health effects.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=The Lancet|date=2007 |volume=370 |issue=9588 |pages=645\u20136 |title=Therapy for autistic children causes outcry in France |author=Spinney L |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61322-1 |pmid=17726792 }}</ref>\n\n===Other methods===\nThere are many simple methods such as priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and cooperative learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit a response to the academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for \u201cincreasing both academic success and social interaction.\u201d<ref>{{vcite journal |doi = 10.1177/0145445501255006|pmid = 11573339|title = Including Children with Autism in General Education Classrooms|journal = Behavior Modification|volume = 25|issue = 5|pages = 762\u2013784|year = 2001|last1 = Harrower|first1 = Joshua K.|last2 = Dunlap|first2 = Glen}}</ref> There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic\u2019s education, such as LEAP, [[Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children]], and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers.

These policies were the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] in 1997, and the [[No Child Left Behind]] in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities.<ref>Education for All Handicapped Children\u2019s Act of 1975</ref><ref>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997</ref><ref>No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</ref> The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education.<ref>Standards.http://www.iies.us/</ref> In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities.

This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education to be a human right. The report also states that the \u201cquality of education should be equal to that of persons without disabilities.\u201d The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for [[vocational education]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = UN Enable - Compilation of International Norms And Standards Relating to Disability| work = United Nations Enable| accessdate = 2015-11-10| date = July 2002| url = https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/discom00.htm}}</ref> The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities.

Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of [[Synaptogenesis|synapses]], and the [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]] upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during [[neurodevelopment]], but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. [[Capillary]] vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more [[neurogenesis|neurons]].\n\nResearch on nonhuman animals finds that more-stimulating environments could aid the treatment and recovery of a diverse variety of brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development.\n\nResearch on humans suggests that lack of stimulation (deprivation\u2014such as in old-style orphanages) delays and impairs cognitive development.

The process of IMT occurs when the client and therapist make up music, through the use of various instruments, song and movement.

Instead of individual behaviors, it targets pivotal areas of a child's development, such as motivation, responsivity to multiple cues, self-management, and social initiations; it aims for widespread improvements in areas that are not specifically targeted. The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange. Intended attempts at the target behavior are rewarded with a natural reinforcer: for example, if a child attempts a request for a stuffed animal, the child receives the animal, not a piece of candy or other unrelated reinforcer.<ref>Pivotal response therapy:\n*{{vcite book |title=Pivotal Response Treatments for Autism: Communication, Social, & Academic Development |author=Koegel RL, Koegel LK |publisher=Brookes |isbn=1-55766-819-1 |date=2006 }}\n*{{vcite journal |journal=Journal of the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps|year=1999 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=174\u201385 |title=Pivotal response intervention I: overview of approach |author=Koegel LK, Koegel RL, Harrower JK, Carter CM |doi=10.2511/rpsd.24.3.174 }}</ref>\n\n====Aversive therapy====\nThe [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]] uses [[aversion therapy]], notably contingent shock ([[electric shock]] delivered to the skin for a few seconds), to control the behavior of its patients, many of whom are autistic.

Children with autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They do not know how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.\n\nCommunication interventions fall into two major categories.

Prizant|title=The SCERTS manual : a comprehensive educational approach for young children with autism spectrum disorders|year=2005|publisher=Paul H. Brookes|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-1-55766-818-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> is an educational model for working with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was designed to help families, educators and therapists work cooperatively together to maximize progress in supporting the child.\n\nThe acronym refers to the focus on:\n\n* SC \u2013 social communication \u2013 the development of functional communication and emotional expression.\n* ER \u2013 emotional regulation \u2013 the development of well-regulated emotions and ability to cope with stress.\n* TS \u2013 transactional support \u2013 the implementation of supports to help families, educators and therapists respond to children's needs, adapt the environment and provide tools to enhance learning.\n\nThe evidence base for the efficacy of the SCERTS Model Practice in the SCERTS model is based on evidence from multiple sources. Efficacy of implementation of practices in the SCERTS Model is supported by empirical evidence from contemporary treatment research in ASD and related disabilities. Currently, federally funded, large sample research has been published and longitudinal studies continue that specifically addresses the effectiveness of SCERTS as a comprehensive treatment framework. The emphasis of current research is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SCERTS for infants, toddlers and school age students in home, school and community settings. This body of research is summarized below. Second, it is rooted in research on child development as well as research addressing the core challenges of ASD. Third, it incorporates the documentation of meaningful change through the collection of clinical and educational data, and programmatic decisions are made based on objective measurement of change. Finally, given that it is not an exclusive model, evidence-based practices (i.e., focused intervention strategies) from other approaches are easily infused in a program plan for an individual. \n\nEmpirical Research on the Efficacy of The SCERTS Model\n\nIn recent years a number of studies have been published that highlight the efficacy of the SCERTS model. Two randomized controlled trials have been published demonstrating the efficacy of the SCERTS Model in the home and classroom settings. The first randomized trial adapted the SCERTS framework for delivery within early intervention settings (Wetherby et al., 2014). Specifically, this study examined the effectiveness of the model when implemented by parents for toddlers with autism within natural settings.   Eighty-two autistic children aged 19 months (SD = 1.93 mos) participated in a 9-month longitudinal study with their primary caregiver.  Children were randomized into two groups \u2013 an individual coaching format and a group coaching format, both focused on teaching parents how to support active engagement within natural contexts using the SCERTS framework.  Individual coaching consisted of in-home support from an interventionist 2-3 times weekly using a collaborative coaching model to build parent capacity and independence in implementation of supports within natural routines geared at facilitating SC and ER development. Parents in this condition were encouraged to deliver intervention by embedding evidence-based strategies for their child\u2019s SC and ER targets in everyday activities for at least 25 hours. This is consistent with the SCERTS Model recommendations. Results found individual coaching was more efficacious than the group-based format.    Outcomes for social communication, receptive language, and adaptive behavior reached statistical significance (Wetherby et al., 2014). \n\nThe efficacy of the SCERTS Model in classrooms was the focus of another large longitudinal randomized control trial.  Morgan et al. (2018) conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial for 197 diverse students with ASD in 129 classrooms across 66 schools in the US.  Mean age of the students was 6.76 years (SD = 1.05years).  Classrooms were randomly assigned to the Classroom SCERTS Intervention (CSI) or Autism Training Modules (ATM) condition. Special education and general education teachers assigned to the CSI condition in this study were trained on the model and provided coaching throughout the school year.  ATM teachers engaged in usual school-based educational practices and had access to online training resources related to autism treatment practices.  Notably, in this study active engagement was used as an outcome measure and was measured by the Classroom Measure of Active Engagement (CMAE; Morgan, Wetherby & Holland, 2010). Additional outcome measures examining adaptive behavior, social skills, and ratings of executive functioning were also used.\n\nResults of Morgan et al. (2018) revealed that students in the CSI condition showed statistically significant better outcomes on observed measures of adaptive communication, social skills and executive functioning than students within the ATM condition.  These data demonstrate the positive impact of SCERTS within a natural environment, that is, the classroom setting, for a heterogeneous sample of students with ASD (Morgan et al., 2018).  This study was chosen by the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee in the US for their 2018 Summary of Advances in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research Report as a key study addressing the question \u201cWhich treatments and interventions will help?\u201d   In their review, the Committee highlighted that 70 percent of teachers trained in CSI implemented with fidelity indicating scalability of the model and also reflecting feasibility with teacher commitment to the model.  They also acknowledged that this is one of the largest studies to measure the effect of school-based active engagement intervention in children with ASD and that the results appear generalizable to a diverse population (Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), 2019). \n\nThe prioritization of active engagement as a measure of effectiveness for educational programs for students with ASD aligns with work by Sparapani and colleagues (2015) that identifies the challenges students diagnosed with autism face in terms of maintaining active engagement and the resulting impact on learning and educational outcomes.   In fact, results suggest typically students with autism actively engage less than half of the time in the classroom (Sparapani, Morgan, Reinhardt, Schatschneider, & Wetherby, 2015).  Consideration of this finding in the context of additional research suggests that increasing active engagement is critical to positive educational outcomes in ASD and reveals a clear need for approaches such as SCERTS that focus on active engagement (National Research Council, 2001).  \n\nThe SCERTS Model has also been the object of international study.  A pilot study was implemented in Hong Kong examining the effectiveness of the SCERTS\u00ae Model  for children with ASD (Yu & Zhu, 2018).  This study examined the implementation of SCERTS\u00ae for 2 different durations (5 months versus 10 months) for children with an average age of 53 months in preschool settings.  Special education teachers, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, and physiotherapists were recruited from 10 special child care centers in Hong Kong. Participating professionals received initial training and then were provided coaching throughout the school year. Each participating special education teacher taught 5-7 children.  Results showed that participating children improved significantly in their social communication and emotional behavior after intervention.  \n\nThe SCERTS Model has also been the subject of a multiple case study design (O\u2019Neill et al., 2010).  Implementation of SCERTS in this study followed a multi-disciplinary team training for the teams of four pupils. All four pupils made progress in Joint Attention, Symbol Use, Mutual Regulation, and Self-Regulation as well as in other measures of receptive communication, expressive communication, play, and coping skills.  Qualitative methods were used to gain insights from the staff related to their experiences in implementing SCERTS.  Central findings from the focus groups with the multidisciplinary team members revealed increased understanding of emotional regulation as a developmental construct, as well as increased clarity of team member roles in supporting children when dysregulated.  \n\nResearchers in the United Kingdom  (Molteni, Guldberg, & Logan, 2013) also examined the feasibility of implementing SCERTS as an ecologically valid model in an independent residential school.  This study aimed to understand how teams work together while learning to implement the SCERTS Model.  At the conclusion of the study, 89% of the team members said they felt comfortable using SCERTS and 78% said the framework improved teamwork in collaborating with colleagues. Specifically, teams highlighted that the quality and accuracy of assessment improved collaboration and understanding of students and their environment.   \n\nSummary\n\nThe SCERTS Model meets criteria for evidence-based practice and offers a framework to directly address the core challenges of ASD, focusing on building an individual\u2019s capacity to initiate communication with a conventional symbolic system and to be actively engaged in emotionally satisfying relationships based on effective reciprocal communication. Emotional regulation goals focus on capacities to regulate attention, arousal and emotional state to cope with everyday stresses in life, and therefore, to be most available for learning and engaging.  Transactional supports are identified, developed and implemented to support individuals of all ages in social engagement and learning, to promote generalization of acquired abilities, and to support their caregivers service providers.  The model provides a roadmap for individualized education and treatment based on a person\u2019s strengths and needs guided by research on child and human development. The SCERTS Model was designed to motivate professionals and families to focus their efforts on enhancing quality of life by addressing the core challenges faced by autistic children, adults and their caregivers, and therefore, to move the field to a new generation of more integrated, comprehensive programs. \n\nDisley, B.

Computer-assisted autism therapy has been proposed to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B|title=A computational simulation tool for training autistic reasoning about mental attitudes |journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2013.04.018 |volume=50 |year=2013 |pages=25\u201343}}</ref> A reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a computer based mental simulator that is capable of modeling mental and emotional states of the real world, has been subject to short-term and long-term evaluations.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B|title=Exhaustive simulation of consecutive mental states of human agents |journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=41 |issue=3 |date=2012 |pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2012.11.001\n}}</ref> The simulator performs the reasoning in the framework of [[belief-desire-intention model]]. Learning starts from the basic concepts of knowledge and intention and proceeds to more complex communicative actions such as explaining, agreeing, and pretending.\n\n===Relationship based, developmental models===\nRelationship based models give importance to the relationships that help children reach and master early developmental milestones. These are often missed or not mastered in children with ASD. Examples of these early milestones are engagement and interest in the world, intimacy with a caregiver, intentionality of action.\n\n====Relationship Development Intervention====\n{{Main|Relationship Development Intervention}}\nRelationship development intervention<ref name=Gutstein_2012>{{vcite journal|last=Gutstein|first=S.

This program is based on the belief that the development of dynamic intelligence (the ability to think flexibly, take different perspectives, cope with change and process information simultaneously) is key to improving the quality of life of children with autism.\n\n====Floortime/DIR====\n{{advert|section|date=June 2012}}\n{{Main|Floortime}}\nThe Floortime/DIR (Developmental, Individual Differences based, Relationship based ) approach is a developmental intervention to autism developed by [[Stanley Greenspan]] and Serena Weider. This approach is based on the idea that the core deficits in autism are individual differences in the [[sensory system]], [[motor planning]] problems, difficulties in communication and relation to others, and the inability to connect ones desire to intentional action and communication. When addressed through a combination of sensory support and DIR/Floortime techniques, the facilitator is playfully obstructive to redirect the child to play and relate to their therapist. The primary goal of Floortime is to improve the child's cognitive, language, and social abilities.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFlFAwAAQBAJ | title=Handbook of Early Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders | publisher=Springer Science+Business Media | author=Tarbox, Jonathan | year=2014 | pages=411| isbn=9781493904013 }}</ref> However, these claims should be regarded with some scepticism, owing to a lack of independent scientific research into the efficacy of the floortime approach.\n\nThe DIR model is based on the model of a developmental 'tree', the central notion being that Autistic children have yet to master certain early developmental milestones, or 'branches' of the tree, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Stage One: Regulation and Interest in the World''': Being calm and feeling well enough to attend to a caregiver and surroundings. Have shared attention.\n*'''Stage Two: Engagement and Relating''': Interest in another person and in the world, developing a special bond with preferred caregivers. Distinguishing inanimate objects from people.\n*'''Stage Three: Two way intentional communication''': Simple back and forth interactions between child and caregiver. Smiles, tickles, anticipatory play.\n*'''Stage Four: Social Problem solving''': Using gestures, interaction, babble to indicate needs, wants, pleasure, upset. Get a caregiver to help with a problem. Using pre-language skills to show intention.\n*'''Stage Five: Symbolic Play''': Using words, pictures, symbols to communicate an intention, idea. Communicate ideas and thoughts, not just wants and needs.\n*'''Stage Six: Bridging Ideas''': This stage is the foundation of logic, reasoning, emotional thinking and a sense of reality.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nExponents of the floortime approach argue that children with ASD struggle with or have missed some of these vital developmental stages. An introduction to DIR/Floortime can be found in the book - Engaging Autism: Using the Floortime Approach to Help Children Relate, Communicate, and Think, by [[Stanley Greenspan]], M.D. and Serena Wieder, PhD.\n\n====The PLAY Project====\n{{primary source section|section|date=December 2017}}\nThe PLAY Project (an acronym for PLAY and Language for Autistic Youngsters) is a community-based, national autism training and [[early childhood intervention]] program established in 2001 by Richard Solomon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.playproject.org/about_drrick.php |title=Richard Solomon, MD Founder of the P.L.A.Y.

Before implementing the home-based program, an institute trains the parents how to accept their child without judgment through a series of dialogue sessions. Like Floortime, parents join their child's ritualistic behavior for relationship-building. To gain the child's \"willing engagement\", the facilitator continues to join them only this time through parallel play. Proponents claim that children will become non-autistic after parents accept them for who they are and engage them in play.

The treatment is repeated several times a week, and can continue for years. It is intended as treatment for autistic children who harm themselves; most of these children cannot speak. Similar envelopment techniques have been used for centuries, such as to calm violent patients in Germany in the 19th century; its modern use in France began in the 1960s, based on psychoanalytic theories such as the theory of the [[Refrigerator mother theory|refrigerator mother]]. Packing is currently used in hundreds of French clinics. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of packing, and some concern about risk of adverse health effects.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=The Lancet|date=2007 |volume=370 |issue=9588 |pages=645\u20136 |title=Therapy for autistic children causes outcry in France |author=Spinney L |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61322-1 |pmid=17726792 }}</ref>\n\n===Other methods===\nThere are many simple methods such as priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and cooperative learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit a response to the academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process.

These policies were the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] in 1997, and the [[No Child Left Behind]] in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities.<ref>Education for All Handicapped Children\u2019s Act of 1975</ref><ref>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997</ref><ref>No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</ref> The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education.<ref>Standards.http://www.iies.us/</ref> In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities.

The United Nations on \u201cInternational Norms and Standards relating to Disability\u201d in 1998. This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education to be a human right. The report also states that the \u201cquality of education should be equal to that of persons without disabilities.\u201d The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for [[vocational education]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = UN Enable - Compilation of International Norms And Standards Relating to Disability| work = United Nations Enable| accessdate = 2015-11-10| date = July 2002| url = https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/discom00.htm}}</ref> The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities. In 2015, a report titled \u201cReport of the Special Rapporteur to the 52nd Session of the Commission for Social Development: Note by the Secretary-General on Monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities\u201d was released.

Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of [[Synaptogenesis|synapses]], and the [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]] upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during [[neurodevelopment]], but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. [[Capillary]] vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more [[neurogenesis|neurons]].\n\nResearch on nonhuman animals finds that more-stimulating environments could aid the treatment and recovery of a diverse variety of brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development.\n\nResearch on humans suggests that lack of stimulation (deprivation\u2014such as in old-style orphanages) delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that higher levels of education (which is both cognitively stimulating in itself, and associates with people engaging in more challenging cognitive activities) results in greater resilience ([[cognitive reserve]]) to the effects of aging and dementia.\n\n===Massage therapy===\n\nA review of [[massage therapy]] as a symptomatic treatment of autism found limited evidence of benefit.

The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, after which the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]\n{{Securities}}\nIn finance, being '''short''' in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of a more conventional \"long\" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises.\n\nThere are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most fundamental method is so-called \"physical\" short-selling, which involves borrowing assets (often [[Security (finance)|securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) and selling them. The investor will later purchase the same number of the same type of securities in order to return them to the lender. If the price has fallen between the time of the initial sale and the time the equivalent securities are repurchased, the investor will have made a profit equal to the difference. Conversely, if the price has risen then the investor will bear a loss. The short seller must usually pay a fee to borrow the securities (charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment), and reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out, such as any dividends that would have been payable to the lender if they were still the holder of shares that they had lent out.\n\nShort positions can also be achieved through [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]] or [[Option (finance)|options]], where the investor can assume an obligation or a right to sell an asset at a future date at a price that is fixed at the time the contract is created. If the price of the asset falls below the agreed price, then the asset can be bought at the lower price before immediately before being sold at the higher price specified in the forward or option contract. A short position can also be achieved through certain types of [[Swap (finance)|swap]], such as [[Contract for difference|contracts for differences]]. These are agreements between two parties to pay each other the difference if the price of an asset rises or falls, under which the party that will benefit if the price falls will have a short position.\n\nBecause a short seller can incur a liability to the lender if the price rises, and because it normally does the short sale through a broker, a short seller is typically required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] to its broker as collateral to ensure that any such liabilities can be met, and to post additional margin if losses begin to accrue. For analogous reasons, short positions in derivatives also usually involve the posting of margin with the [[counterparty]]. Any failure to post margin promptly would prompt the broker or counterparty to close the position.\n\nShort selling is nearly always undertaken only in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]] that are [[Fungibility|fungible]] and reasonably [[liquidity|liquid]].\n\nA short sale may have a variety of objectives. [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. Alternatively, traders or fund managers may use offsetting short positions to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks that exist in a long position or a portfolio.\n\nResearch indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.<ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf</ref><ref>http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf</ref><ref>http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&context=njilb</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf</ref> Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.<ref>http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n{{Finance sidebar}}\nThe following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term \"borrowing\" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a bicycle, where the same bicycle must be returned, not merely one that is the same model).\n\nA short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.<ref name=\"langasset\">{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling \u2013 A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.\n\nThe act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called \"covering the short\" or \"covering the position\". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.\n\n\"Shorting\" or \"going short\" (and sometimes also \"short selling\") also refer more broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. Derivatives contracts that can be used in this way include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].<ref name=Harris>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195144703 |page=41}}</ref><ref name=Chance>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.\n\nThe vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.\n\nBrokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)\n\nMost brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the \"locate\" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.\n\nStock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the \"short interest\" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e., despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.\n\n=== Securities lending ===\n{{Main|Securities lending}}\n\nWhen a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].\n\n=== Sources of short interest data ===\nTime delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.<ref>NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].</ref>\n\nSome market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems<ref>SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.</ref>) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.<ref>SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.</ref>\n\n=== Short selling terms ===\n'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10&nbsp;million / 1 million).\n\n'''Short Interest''' relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10&nbsp;million / 100&nbsp;million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, \"fails\" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.\n\n'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account \u2013 in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become \"hard to borrow\" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant \u2013 in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.<ref name=\"marketForborrowing\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) \u2013 for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.<ref name=\"hardToBorrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Major lenders ====\n* [[State Street Corporation]] (Boston, United States)\n* [[Merrill Lynch]] (New Jersey, United States)\n* [[JP Morgan Chase]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Northern Trust]] (Chicago, United States)\n* [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, now defunct)\n* [[ABN AMRO]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, formerly Fortis)\n* [[Citibank]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] Corporation (New York, United States)\n* [[UBS AG]] (Zurich, Switzerland)\n* [[Barclays]] (London, United Kingdom)\n\n===Naked short selling===\n{{Main|Naked short selling}}\nA naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.) This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.\n\nWhen the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.\n\nNaked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a \"failure to deliver\" or simply \"fail.\"  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.\n\nIn the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.\n\n== Fees ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nWhen a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.\n\nIf the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.\n\nWhen a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.\n\nFor some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.\n\n== Dividends and voting rights ==\nWhere shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate\u2014though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.\n\nA similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Markets ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Futures and options contracts ===\nWhen trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.\n\nAn investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or \"strike\") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.\n\n=== Currency ===\nSelling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.\n\nNovice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a contract is always long in terms of one medium and short another.\n\nWhen the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.\n\nAn example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the US dollar and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs. 50 and the trader borrows Rs. 100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs. 51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs. 102.  He returns Rs. 100 and keeps the Rs. 2 profit (minus fees).\n\nOne may also take a short position in a currency using [[Currency future|futures]] or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.\n\n== Risks ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''\n\nShort selling is sometimes referred to as a \"negative income investment strategy\" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called \"going long\") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a \"long's\" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.\n\nMany short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short\u2014an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.\n\nShort sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[Margin calls|margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the \"short interest\" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.\n\nAnother risk is that a given stock may become \"hard to borrow.\" As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time (\"buy in\").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is \"failing to deliver\" stock, which leads to the buy-in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: \"He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n.\" To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nShort sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&pg=PP7#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J.

The farmer would take a short position in wheat futures.\n* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.\n* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that they are not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie their options\n\n=== Arbitrage ===\n{{Further|Arbitrage}}\nA short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are\n* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].\n\n=== Against the box ===\nOne variant of selling short involves a long position. \"Selling short against the box\" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.\n\nU.S. investors considering entering into a \"short against the box\" transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction.  Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a \"short against the box\" position to be a \"constructive sale\" of the long position, which is a taxable event.  These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e8793 |title=United States IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Regulations==\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] gave the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the power to regulate short sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |year=1934 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}</ref> The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the [[uptick rule]] that dictated that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price.

The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, after which the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]\n{{Securities}}\nIn finance, being '''short''' in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of a more conventional \"long\" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises.\n\nThere are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most fundamental method is so-called \"physical\" short-selling, which involves borrowing assets (often [[Security (finance)|securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) and selling them. The investor will later purchase the same number of type of securities in order to return them to the lender. If the price has fallen between the time of the initial sale and the time the equivalent securities are repurchased, the investor will have made a profit equal to the difference. Conversely, if the price has risen then the investor will bear a loss. The short seller must usually pay a fee to borrow the securities (charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment), and reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out, such as any dividends that would have been payable to the lender if they were still the holder of shares that they had lent out.\n\nShort positions can also be achieved through [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]] or [[Option (finance)|options]], where the investor can assume an obligation or a right to sell an asset at a future date at a price that is fixed at the time the contract is created. If the price of the asset falls below the agreed price, then the asset can be bought at the lower price before immediately before being sold at the higher price specified in the forward or option contract. A short position can also be achieved through certain types of [[Swap (finance)|swap]], such as [[Contract for difference|contracts for differences]]. These are agreements between two parties to pay each other the difference if the price of an asset rises or falls, under which the party that will benefit if the price falls will have a short position.\n\nBecause a short seller can incur a liability to the lender if the price rises, and because it normally does the short sale through a broker, a short seller is typically required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] to its broker as collateral to ensure that any such liabilities can be met, and to post additional margin if losses begin to accrue. For analogous reasons, short positions in derivatives also usually involve the posting of margin with the [[counterparty]]. Any failure to post margin promptly would prompt the broker or counterparty to close the position.\n\nShort selling is nearly always undertaken only in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]] that are [[Fungibility|fungible]] and reasonably [[liquidity|liquid]].\n\nA short sale may have a variety of objectives. [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. Alternatively, traders or fund managers may use offsetting short positions to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks that exist in a long position or a portfolio.\n\nResearch indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.<ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf</ref><ref>http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf</ref><ref>http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&context=njilb</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf</ref> Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.<ref>http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n{{Finance sidebar}}\nThe following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term \"borrowing\" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a bicycle, where the same bicycle must be returned, not merely one that is the same model).\n\nA short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.<ref name=\"langasset\">{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling \u2013 A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.\n\nThe act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called \"covering the short\" or \"covering the position\". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.\n\n\"Shorting\" or \"going short\" (and sometimes also \"short selling\") also refer more broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. Derivatives contracts that can be used in this way include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].<ref name=Harris>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195144703 |page=41}}</ref><ref name=Chance>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

Investors continue to argue this only contributes to market inefficiency.<ref name=\"Lavinio\" />\n\n== Mechanism ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\n{{see also|Securities lending}}\n\n=== Shorting stock in the U.S. ===\nTo sell stocks short in the U.S., the seller must arrange for a broker-dealer to confirm that it can deliver the shorted securities. This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.\n\nThe vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.\n\nBrokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)\n\nMost brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the \"locate\" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.\n\nStock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the \"short interest\" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e., despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.\n\n=== Securities lending ===\n{{Main|Securities lending}}\n\nWhen a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].\n\n=== Sources of short interest data ===\nTime delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.<ref>NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].</ref>\n\nSome market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems<ref>SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.</ref>) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.<ref>SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.</ref>\n\n=== Short selling terms ===\n'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10&nbsp;million / 1 million).\n\n'''Short Interest''' relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10&nbsp;million / 100&nbsp;million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, \"fails\" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.\n\n'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account \u2013 in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become \"hard to borrow\" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant \u2013 in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.<ref name=\"marketForborrowing\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) \u2013 for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.<ref name=\"hardToBorrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Major lenders ====\n* [[State Street Corporation]] (Boston, United States)\n* [[Merrill Lynch]] (New Jersey, United States)\n* [[JP Morgan Chase]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Northern Trust]] (Chicago, United States)\n* [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, now defunct)\n* [[ABN AMRO]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, formerly Fortis)\n* [[Citibank]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] Corporation (New York, United States)\n* [[UBS AG]] (Zurich, Switzerland)\n* [[Barclays]] (London, United Kingdom)\n\n===Naked short selling===\n{{Main|Naked short selling}}\nA naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.) This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.\n\nWhen the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.\n\nNaked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a \"failure to deliver\" or simply \"fail.\"  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.\n\nIn the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.\n\n== Fees ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nWhen a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.\n\nIf the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.\n\nWhen a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.\n\nFor some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.\n\n== Dividends and voting rights ==\nWhere shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate\u2014though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.\n\nA similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Markets ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Futures and options contracts ===\nWhen trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.\n\nAn investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or \"strike\") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.\n\n=== Currency ===\nSelling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.\n\nNovice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a contract is always long in terms of one medium and short another.\n\nWhen the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.\n\nAn example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the US dollar and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs. 50 and the trader borrows Rs. 100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs. 51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs. 102.  He returns Rs. 100 and keeps the Rs. 2 profit (minus fees).\n\nOne may also take a short position in a currency using [[Currency future|futures]] or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.\n\n== Risks ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''\n\nShort selling is sometimes referred to as a \"negative income investment strategy\" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called \"going long\") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a \"long's\" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.\n\nMany short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short\u2014an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.\n\nShort sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[Margin calls|margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the \"short interest\" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.\n\nAnother risk is that a given stock may become \"hard to borrow.\" As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time (\"buy in\").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is \"failing to deliver\" stock, which leads to the buy-in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: \"He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n.\" To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nShort sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&pg=PP7#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J.

The farmer would take a short position in wheat futures.\n* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.\n* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that they are not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie their options\n\n=== Arbitrage ===\n{{Further|Arbitrage}}\nA short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are\n* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].\n\n=== Against the box ===\nOne variant of selling short involves a long position. \"Selling short against the box\" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price.

As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the London Company owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} settlement within this area. The portion of the company's territory north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] was shared with the [[Plymouth Company]], with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161&nbsp;km) of each other.\n\nThe London Company made landfall on 26 April 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which they named [[Cape Henry]], near present-day [[Virginia Beach]]. Deciding to move the encampment, on 4 May 1607, they established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]]  on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} upstream from its mouth at the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its [[Popham Colony]] in present-day [[Maine]], but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the London Company was adjusted with a new grant that extended from \"sea to sea\" of the previously-shared area between the 38th and [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the ''Somers Isles (or [[Bermuda]]).\n\nThe London Company struggled financially, especially with labour shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a [[cash crop]] beginning in 1612.

Each company was made up of investors, known as \"adventurers\", who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned. More than 6,300 Englishmen invested in joint-stock companies between 1585 and 1630, trading in Russia, Turkey, Africa, the East Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America.\n\n===Founding===\nInvestors in the [[Virginia Company]] hoped to profit from the natural resources of the New World.

They named this shore as [[Cape Henry]]. They were attacked by Native Americans, and the settlers moved north. On 14 May 1607, these first settlers selected the site of [[Jamestown Island]], further upriver and on the northern shore, as the place to build their fort.\n\nIn addition to survival, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realised there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.\n[[File:Jamestown_settler_dead_in_the_swamp.jpg|thumb|Jamestown Settler dead in the swamp]]\nWithin the three-sided fort erected on the banks of the James, the settlers quickly discovered that they were, first and foremost, employees of the Virginia Company of London, following instructions of the men appointed by the Company to rule them. In exchange, the laborers were armed, and received clothes and food from the common store. After seven years, they were to receive land of their own. The gentlemen, who provided their own armor and weapons, were to be paid in land, dividends or additional shares of stock.\n\nInitially, the colonists were governed by a president and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to carve out a new settlement on a frontier. When [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with [[Chief Powhatan]]'s people improved.\n[[File:Colonial_Jamestown_About_1614.jpg|thumb|Artist conception of aerial view of Jamestown 1614]]\n\n=== Instructions for the Virginia Company ===\nAfter so many failed colonizing attempts in the 16th Century such as the [[Roanoke Colony]] and with the ascension of [[James VI and I|King James]] to the throne of England on 24 March 1603 the effort to colonize was renewed, this time in the form of joint stock companies, which did not involve the public (King's) treasury thus from a Royal perspective a risk-free endeavor. Although a profit-driven enterprise, the King was motivated by international rivalry and the propagation of religion, and the individuals who undertook the risk of venturing to the new world were motivated by a chance to improve their economic and social standing.\n\nThus King James awarded a patent to a group of investors which included detailed instructions for everything from where to place watchmen and with how many, to where to plant.  It instructed [[Christopher Newport]], captain of the [[Susan Constant]], and [[Bartholomew Gosnold]], captain of the [[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]] and leader of the expedition of three ships, on their duties upon reaching the land they named Virginia. There were no instructions for administration or governance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/instructions-for-the-virginia-colony-1606.php|title=Instructions for the Virginia Colony 1606|website=American History Revoluion to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The Charter of 1606 ===\n{{main|Charter of 1606}}\nThe First Virginia Charter established provisions for governance of the colony. It was to be governed by a  colonial council, which proved ineffective.  A governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord Delaware]], was dispatched in  1610 to provide firmer governance of the colony. The council back in London whose directives and interests Lord Delaware represented was composed of knights, gentlemen and  merchants who had invested in the company. This charter also limited the jurisdiction of the Virginia company  of London to 100 miles from the seaboard and from 38 degrees to 45 degrees latitude north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-first-virginia-charter-1606.php|title=First Virginia Company|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction}}</ref>\n\n===Charter of 1609===\n{{Main|Second Virginia Charter}}\n[[Image:Wpdms virginia company plymouth council.png|right|thumb|The 1608 grant to the Virginia Company of London \"from sea to sea\" is shown demarcated in red.

When Gates finally arrived to take up his new post in 1610, with most of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' (on two new ships built in Bermuda, the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience''), he found that only 60 of the original 214 colonists had survived the infamous [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|\"Starving Time\" of 1609\u20131610]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222010/http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 }} Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities: ''Jamestown History''</ref> Most of these were dying or ill. Despite the abundance of food which Gates' expedition brought from Bermuda (which had necessitated the building of two ships), it was clear the colony was not yet self-sufficient and could not survive.\n\nThe survivors of Jamestown were taken aboard the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience'', and the colony was abandoned. Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Governor Lord De la Warre]], granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the ''Patience'' to obtain more food.

The Company debt was now over \u00a39,000. Worried Virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic Treasurer Sandys, who warned that the Company \"cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves.\"  In March 1622, the Company's and the colony's situation went from dire to disastrous when, during the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], the [[Powhatan]] confederacy killed one-quarter of the European population of the Virginia colony.\n\nWhen the Crown and company officials proposed a fourth charter, severely reducing the Company's ability to make decisions in the governing of Virginia, subscribers rejected it. King James I forthwith changed the status of Virginia in 1624, taking control of it as a [[royal colony]] to be administered by a governor appointed by the King.  The government's colonial policy of export restrictions however, did not change. The Crown approved the election of a Virginia Assembly in 1627. This form of government, with governor and assembly, would oversee the colony of Virginia until 1776, excepting only the years of the [[English Commonwealth]].\n\nBermuda had been separated from the Virginia Company in 1614, when the Crown briefly took over its administration. In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which continued to operate Bermuda. It was subsequently, also known officially as ''The Somers Isles'' (for the Admiral of the Virginia Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]]) until being dissolved in 1684 and made a royal colony. Meetings were held at town hall to discuss the distribution of the tobacco.\n\n==Native American relationships==\nThe instructions issued to Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], on 20 November 1608, called for a forcible conversion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to [[Anglicanism]] and their subordination to the colonial administration. The records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to \"give adventurers, a clearness and satisfaction\", a public debate where Catholics and neutrals might attack them. Whereas Catholic arguments would be in support of Spanish legal claims to the [[New World]] under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], it was feared that the neutral \"pen-adversaries\" might \"cast scruples into our conscience\" by \"criticising the lawfulness of the plantation.\" It was decided to forego such a publication of a justification.\n\nIn 1608, Sir [[Edward Coke]], in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], offered a ruling in ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' that went beyond the issue at hand: whether a Scotsman could seek justice at an English Court. Coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with England and friendly aliens, those from nations in league with England. Friendly aliens could have recourse to English courts. But he also ruled that with \"all infidels\" (i.e. those from non-Christian nations), there could be no peace, and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between them and Christians.<ref name = Williams1990>{{Cite book\n|isbn = 978-0195050226\n|ol = 2058188M\n|publisher = Oxford, England: Oxford University Press\n|title = The American Indian in Western Legal Thought\n|chapter = The English Conquest of America\n|author = Williams, Robert A.\n|date = 1990\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193 193\u2013232]\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1609, the company issued instructions to settlers to kidnap Native American children so as to educate them with English values and religion. These instructions also sanctioned attacking the [[Iniocasoocke]]s, the cultural leaders of the local [[Powhatans]]. Only after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] arrived in 1610, was the Company able to commence a war against the Powhatan with the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. De La Warr was replaced by Sir [[Thomas Dale]], who continued the war, which continued until a truce was made with the marriage of  [[Pocahontas]] to [[John Rolfe]] in 1614.\n\nThe military offensive was accompanied by a propaganda war: Alderman Robert Johnson published ''Nova Britannia'', in 1609, which compared Native Americans to wild animals--\"heardes of deere in a forest\". While it did portray the Powhatan as peace-loving, it threatened to deal with any who resisted conversion to Anglicanism as enemies of their country. (Johnson was the son-in-law of [[Sir Thomas Smythe]], treasurer of the Company in London and leader of its \"court\" faction.)\n\nThe Company began to turn a profit after 1612, when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.\n\nIn 1622, the [[Second Anglo-Powhatan War]] erupted. Its origins are disputed. English apologists for the company say that [[Opchanacanough]] initiated the war. [[Robert A. Williams Jr.|Robert Williams]], a 21st-century Native American law professor, argues that Opchanacanough had secured concessions from Governor Yeardley which the company would not accept. Thus, Opchanacanough's [[Indian massacre of 1622|attack]], on 18 April 1622, may have been a pre-emptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrived.{{refn|name=Williams1990}} {{rp|213\u2013217}}\n\nIn about a day, the Powhatan killed 350 of 1,240 colonists, destroying some outlying settlements. The Virginia Company quickly published an account of this attack. It was steeped in [[Calvinist]] theology of the time: the massacre was the work of [[Divine Providence|Providence]] in that it was justification for the destruction of the Powhatan, and building English settlements over their former towns. New orders from the London Company directed a \"perpetual war without peace or truce\" \"to root out from being any longer a people, so cursed a nation, ungrateful to all benefitte, and incapable of all goodnesses.\"\n<ref name = Bryant&Gay1876>{{Cite book\n|publisher = London, England: Sampson Lowe, Marston, Searle & Rivington\n|title = A Popular History of the United States\n|author1 = Bryant, William Cullen\n|author2 = Gay, Sidney Howard\n|date = 1876\n|url= https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog\n|volume = 1\n|page = [https://archive.org/details/apopularhistory04gaygoog/page/n552 481]\n}}</ref> Within two years, the Crown took over the territory in 1624 as a [[royal colony]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[Richard Hakluyt]], a director of the company\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[Somers Isles Company]]\n* [[Edwin Sandys (American colonist)|Sir Edwin Sandys]]\n* [[Captain Thomas Graves|Thomas Graves]]\n* [[Nicholas Ferrar]]\n*[[John Ferrar]]\n* [[Samuel Argall]]\n* [[John Harvey (Virginia)|Sir John Harvey]]\n* [[Samuel Jordan]]\n* [[William Farrar (settler)|William Farrar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London'' edited and introduction by Samuel M.

As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the London Company owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} settlement within this area. The portion of the company's territory north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] was shared with the [[Plymouth Company]], with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161&nbsp;km) of each other.\n\nThe London Company made landfall on 26 April 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which they named [[Cape Henry]], near present-day [[Virginia Beach]]. Deciding to move the encampment, on 4 May 1607, they established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]]  on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] about {{convert|40|mi|km}} upstream from its mouth at the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its [[Popham Colony]] in present-day [[Maine]], but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the London Company was adjusted with a new grant that extended from \"sea to sea\" of the previously-shared area between the 38th and [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the ''Somers Isles (or [[Bermuda]]).\n\nThe London Company struggled financially, especially with labour shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a [[cash crop]] beginning in 1612. By 1619 a system of indentured service was fully developed in the colony;<ref>Karl Frederick Geiser, [https://archive.org/stream/redemptionersind00geis/redemptionersind00geis_djvu.txt Redemptioners and indentured servants in the colony and commonwealth of Pennsylvania], p.5.

Each company was made up of investors, known as \"adventurers\", who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned. More than 6,300 Englishmen invested in joint-stock companies between 1585 and 1630, trading in Russia, Turkey, Africa, the East Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America.\n\n===Founding===\nInvestors in the [[Virginia Company]] hoped to profit from the natural resources of the New World. In 1606 Captain [[Bartholomew Gosnold]] obtained of King [[James VI and I|James I]] a charter for two companies.

They named this shore as [[Cape Henry]]. They were attacked by Native Americans, and the settlers moved north. On 14 May 1607, these first settlers selected the site of [[Jamestown Island]], further upriver and on the northern shore, as the place to build their fort.\n\nIn addition to survival, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realised there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.\n[[File:Jamestown_settler_dead_in_the_swamp.jpg|thumb|Jamestown Settler dead in the swamp]]\nWithin the three-sided fort erected on the banks of the James, the settlers quickly discovered that they were, first and foremost, employees of the Virginia Company of London, following instructions of the men appointed by the Company to rule them. In exchange, the laborers were armed, and received clothes and food from the common store. After seven years, they were to receive land of their own. The gentlemen, who provided their own armor and weapons, were to be paid in land, dividends or additional shares of stock.\n\nInitially, the colonists were governed by a president and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to carve out a new settlement on a frontier. When [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with [[Chief Powhatan]]'s people improved.\n[[File:Colonial_Jamestown_About_1614.jpg|thumb|Artist conception of aerial view of Jamestown 1614]]\n\n=== Instructions for the Virginia Company ===\nAfter so many failed colonizing attempts in the 16th Century such as the [[Roanoke Colony]] and with the ascension of [[James VI and I|King James]] to the throne of England on 24 March 1603 the effort to colonize was renewed, this time in the form of joint stock companies, which did not involve the public (King's) treasury thus from a Royal perspective a risk-free endeavor. Although a profit-driven enterprise, the King was motivated by international rivalry and the propagation of religion, and the individuals who undertook the risk of venturing to the new world were motivated by a chance to improve their economic and social standing.\n\nThus King James awarded a patent to a group of investors which included detailed instructions for everything from where to place watchmen and with how many, to where to plant.  It instructed [[Christopher Newport]], captain of the [[Susan Constant]], and [[Bartholomew Gosnold]], captain of the [[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]] and leader of the expedition of three ships, on their duties upon reaching the land they named Virginia. There were no instructions for administration or governance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/instructions-for-the-virginia-colony-1606.php|title=Instructions for the Virginia Colony 1606|website=American History Revoluion to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The Charter of 1606 ===\n{{main|Charter of 1606}}\nThe First Virginia Charter established provisions for governance of the colony. It was to be governed by a  colonial council, which proved ineffective.  A governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord Delaware]], was dispatched in  1610 to provide firmer governance of the colony. The council back in London whose directives and interests Lord Delaware represented was composed of knights, gentlemen and  merchants who had invested in the company. This charter also limited the jurisdiction of the Virginia company  of London to 100 miles from the seaboard and from 38 degrees to 45 degrees latitude north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-first-virginia-charter-1606.php|title=First Virginia Company|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction}}</ref>\n\n===Charter of 1609===\n{{Main|Second Virginia Charter}}\n[[Image:Wpdms virginia company plymouth council.png|right|thumb|The 1608 grant to the Virginia Company of London \"from sea to sea\" is shown demarcated in red.

Investment boomed as the Company launched an intensive recruitment campaign.

When Gates finally arrived to take up his new post in 1610, with most of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' (on two new ships built in Bermuda, the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience''), he found that only 60 of the original 214 colonists had survived the infamous [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|\"Starving Time\" of 1609\u20131610]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222010/http://www.apva.org/history/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 }} Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities: ''Jamestown History''</ref> Most of these were dying or ill. Despite the abundance of food which Gates' expedition brought from Bermuda (which had necessitated the building of two ships), it was clear the colony was not yet self-sufficient and could not survive.\n\nThe survivors of Jamestown were taken aboard the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience'', and the colony was abandoned. Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Governor Lord De la Warre]], granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the ''Patience'' to obtain more food. (Somers died there, and his nephew, Matthew Somers, the captain of the ''Patience'', sailed the vessel to [[Lyme Regis]] in England, instead, to claim his inheritance).\n\n=== Charter of 1612 ===\nThe third Virginia \u00a0Charter or Charter of 1612, was essentially the same as the Charter of 1609, with the difference being\u00a0 territorial jurisdiction, expanding it to the Atlantic Islands like Bermuda and from \u201csea to sea\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-third-virginia-charter-1612.php|title=The Third Virginia Charter|website=American History Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond}}</ref>\n\n=== The \"Great Charter\" ===\nThis was an ordinance and constitution that proceeded from a set of instructions issued in 1618 to the governor and the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] known as An Ordinance and Constitution of the Virginia Company in England 24 July 1621.<ref name=\"ThreeCharters1957\">{{Cite book|title=The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London with Seven Related Documents|chapter= \"Virginia Company, Instructions to Governor Yeardley\"(Sometimes called \"The Great Charter\")|editor=Bemiss, Samuel M.|date=1957|publisher=Williamsburg, VA: Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation|chapter-url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36181/36181-h/36181-h.htm#pg_8}}</ref> This document replaced military law with common law, and provided for land ownership for settlers living in the colony.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kukla, Jon|year=1985|title=Order and Chaos in Early America: Political and Social Stability in Pre-Restoration Virginia|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=90|issue=2|pages=275\u2013299|jstor=1852667|doi=10.2307/1852667}}</ref>{{rp|283}} It is\u00a0also of great significance for it provides governance independent of the Crown.

The Company debt was now over \u00a39,000. Worried Virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic Treasurer Sandys, who warned that the Company \"cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves.\"  In March 1622, the Company's and the colony's situation went from dire to disastrous when, during the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], the [[Powhatan]] confederacy killed one-quarter of the European population of the Virginia colony.\n\nWhen the Crown and company officials proposed a fourth charter, severely reducing the Company's ability to make decisions in the governing of Virginia, subscribers rejected it. King James I forthwith changed the status of Virginia in 1624, taking control of it as a [[royal colony]] to be administered by a governor appointed by the King.  The government's colonial policy of export restrictions however, did not change. The Crown approved the election of a Virginia Assembly in 1627. This form of government, with governor and assembly, would oversee the colony of Virginia until 1776, excepting only the years of the [[English Commonwealth]].\n\nBermuda had been separated from the Virginia Company in 1614, when the Crown briefly took over its administration. In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which continued to operate Bermuda. It was subsequently, also known officially as ''The Somers Isles'' (for the Admiral of the Virginia Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]]) until being dissolved in 1684 and made a royal colony. Meetings were held at town hall to discuss the distribution of the tobacco.\n\n==Native American relationships==\nThe instructions issued to Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], on 20 November 1608, called for a forcible conversion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to [[Anglicanism]] and their subordination to the colonial administration. The records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to \"give adventurers, a clearness and satisfaction\", a public debate where Catholics and neutrals might attack them. Whereas Catholic arguments would be in support of Spanish legal claims to the [[New World]] under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], it was feared that the neutral \"pen-adversaries\" might \"cast scruples into our conscience\" by \"criticising the lawfulness of the plantation.\" It was decided to forego such a publication of a justification.\n\nIn 1608, Sir [[Edward Coke]], in his capacity as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], offered a ruling in ''[[Calvin's Case]]'' that went beyond the issue at hand: whether a Scotsman could seek justice at an English Court. Coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with England and friendly aliens, those from nations in league with England. Friendly aliens could have recourse to English courts. But he also ruled that with \"all infidels\" (i.e. those from non-Christian nations), there could be no peace, and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between them and Christians.<ref name = Williams1990>{{Cite book\n|isbn = 978-0195050226\n|ol = 2058188M\n|publisher = Oxford, England: Oxford University Press\n|title = The American Indian in Western Legal Thought\n|chapter = The English Conquest of America\n|author = Williams, Robert A.\n|date = 1990\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193 193\u2013232]\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/americanindianin0000will/page/193\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1609, the company issued instructions to settlers to kidnap Native American children so as to educate them with English values and religion. These instructions also sanctioned attacking the [[Iniocasoocke]]s, the cultural leaders of the local [[Powhatans]]. Only after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] arrived in 1610, was the Company able to commence a war against the Powhatan with the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. De La Warr was replaced by Sir [[Thomas Dale]], who continued the war, which continued until a truce was made with the marriage of  [[Pocahontas]] to [[John Rolfe]] in 1614.\n\nThe military offensive was accompanied by a propaganda war: Alderman Robert Johnson published ''Nova Britannia'', in 1609, which compared Native Americans to wild animals--\"heardes of deere in a forest\". While it did portray the Powhatan as peace-loving, it threatened to deal with any who resisted conversion to Anglicanism as enemies of their country. (Johnson was the son-in-law of [[Sir Thomas Smythe]], treasurer of the Company in London and leader of its \"court\" faction.)\n\nThe Company began to turn a profit after 1612, when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.\n\nIn 1622, the [[Second Anglo-Powhatan War]] erupted. Its origins are disputed. English apologists for the company say that [[Opchanacanough]] initiated the war. [[Robert A. Williams Jr.|Robert Williams]], a 21st-century Native American law professor, argues that Opchanacanough had secured concessions from Governor Yeardley which the company would not accept. Thus, Opchanacanough's [[Indian massacre of 1622|attack]], on 18 April 1622, may have been a pre-emptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrived.{{refn|name=Williams1990}} {{rp|213\u2013217}}\n\nIn about a day, the Powhatan killed 350 of 1,240 colonists, destroying some outlying settlements. The Virginia Company quickly published an account of this attack. It was steeped in [[Calvinist]] theology of the time: the massacre was the work of [[Divine Providence|Providence]] in that it was justification for the destruction of the Powhatan, and building English settlements over their former towns.
