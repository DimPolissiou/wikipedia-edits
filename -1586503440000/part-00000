While studying medicine in [[Pavia]] as a young man, Augustus returned late one night to his lodgings (without a key) to find no one awake to let him in. Climbing up to a balcony, he was able to enter through a window, and at once sought out the maidservant, who should have been awake to admit him. On checking her room, however, he found her lying unconscious - beyond rousing - on the floor. The following morning he tried to question her on the matter, but she would only reply that she had been 'on a journey'.\n\nBartolommeo's second account is more suggestive and points toward another element in the witches' 'flights'. It concerns a certain [[notary]] of [[Lugano]] who, unable to find his wife one morning, searched for her all over their estate and finally discovered her lying deeply unconscious, naked and filthy with her vagina exposed, in a corner of the pigsty. The notary 'immediately understood that she was a witch' (!) and at first wanted to kill her on the spot, but, thinking better of such rashness, waited until she recovered from her stupor, in order to question her. Terrified by his wrath, the poor woman fell to her knees and confessed that during the night she had 'been on a journey'.\n\nLight is cast on the tale of the notary's wife by two accounts widely separated in time but revealing a persistent theme in European Witchcraft. The first is that of [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] whose ''De synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis libri duo'' (circa 906 C.E.) speaks of women who 'seduced...by demons...insist that they ride at night ''on certain beasts'' [italics not original] together with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the pagans, and a great multitude of women; that they cover great distances in the silence of the deepest night...'<ref>Quoted in : Ginzburg, Carlo, ''Ecstasies.

Siri claimed that when she was seven her grandmother had taken her to the witches' sabbath on the mountain meadow [[Blockula]] ('blue-hill') : her grandmother led her to a pigsty, where she smeared a [[Domestic pig|sow]] with some ointment which she took from a [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], whereupon grandmother and granddaughter mounted the animal and, after a short ride through the air, arrived at a building on the Sabbath mountain.<ref>Quoted in Pickering, David : ''A Dictionary of Witchcraft'' pub.

The testimony of Dame Kyteler's maidservant, [[Petronilla de Meath]], while somewhat compromised by having been extracted under [[torture]], contains references not only to her mistress's abilities in the preparation of 'magical' medicines, but also her sexual behaviour, including at least one instance of (alleged) intercourse with a [[demon]].<ref>Williams, Bernadette, 'The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler,' History Ireland Vol. 2, No.4 (Winter, 1994)</ref><ref>Davidson, Sharon, and John O.

The fifth charge is of particular interest in the context of the 'greased staffe' mentioned above :\n{{quote|In order to [[Aphrodisiac|arouse feelings of love]] or hatred, or to inflict death or disease on the bodies of the faithful, they made use of powders, [[unguent]]s, ointments and candles of fat, which were compounded as follows. They took the entrails of cocks sacrificed to demons, certain horrible worms, various unspecified herbs, dead men's nails, the hair, brains, and shreds of the cerements of boys who were buried unbaptized, with other abominations, all of which they cooked, with various incantations, over a fire of oak-logs in a vessel made out of the skull of a decapitated thief.<ref>Seymour, St. John D. ''Irish Witchcraft and Demonology'' pub. Dorset Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88029-734-4}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}}}\nDeducting from the above ingredients of purely symbolic significance relating to death and heresy, one is left with the cooking, in a [[Animal fat|fatty]] mixture, of 'unspecified herbs' and 'horrible worms' to produce, among other preparations, 'unguents' and 'ointments' - one of which was the 'staffe-greasing' ointment later found in the 'pipe' discovered in Dame Alice's closet. It is unfortunate that the identities of the herbs and 'worms' involved went unrecorded. Those of the 'unspecified herbs' may well be guessed at in the light of information regarding later flying ointment recipes, but the 'horrible worms' remain more cryptic : it is unclear whether actual worms or insect larvae are intended. If the latter, such larvae might themselves have been poisonous and intoxicating, from having fed on alkaloidal plants.\n\nComparison of Alice Kyteler's 'staffe' and Siri J\u00f8rgensdatter's sow - both greased with a mysterious ointment, suggest the innate conservatism of European Witchcraft and the persistence of a body of women's knowledge related to sexuality and the use of a potent and complex drug.\n\n==Possible opiate component==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Die Giftpflanzen Deutschlands (1910) (20738415388).jpg|thumb|Opium Poppy : ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'']]\nOne possible key to how individuals dealt with the toxicity of the nightshades usually said to be part of flying ointments is through the supposed antidotal reaction some of the solanaceous alkaloids have with the alkaloids of ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'' (opium poppy). This is discussed by Alexander Kuklin in his brief book, ''How Do Witches Fly?'' (DNA Press, 1999). This antagonism was claimed to exist by the movement of [[Eclectic medicine]]. For instance, [[King's American Dispensatory]] states in the entry on belladonna: \"Belladonna and opium appear to exert antagonistic influences, especially as regards their action on the brain, the spinal cord, and heart; they have consequently been recommended and employed as antidotes to each other in cases of poisoning\" going on to make the extravagant claim that \"this matter is now positively and satisfactorily settled; hence in all cases of poisoning by belladonna the great remedy is morphine, and its use may be guided by the degree of pupillary contraction it occasions.\" The use of opiates in the treatment of belladonna poisoning is, however, strongly contraindicated in modern medical practice [see below].\n\nThe synergy between belladonna and poppy alkaloids was made use of in the so-called \"[[twilight sleep]]\" that was provided for women during [[childbirth]] beginning in the [[Edwardian era]]. Twilight sleep was a mixture of [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], a belladonna alkaloid, and [[morphine]], a ''[[Papaver]]'' alkaloid, that was injected and which furnished a combination of painkilling and amnesia for a woman in labor. A version is still manufactured for use as the injectable compound ''[[Omnopon]]''.\n\nThere is no definite indication of the proportions of solanaceous herbs vs. poppy used in flying ointments, and most historical recipes for flying ointment do not include poppy.\nFurthermore, a reputable publication by the former UK [[Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries]] (now [[DEFRA]]) states specifically that, in cases of poisoning by ''Atropa belladonna'' - far from being antidotes - 'Preparations containing morphine or opiates should be ''avoided'' as they have a [[synergic]] action with atropine'; an appropriate antidote being, by contrast, the [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]] [[physostigmine]] salicylate.<ref>Cooper, Marion R. and Johnson, Anthony W.

And although they never fly at all, they think, as soon as they wake, that they have all been to see the calf, and all visited the fields at [[Baraona]].

While studying medicine in [[Pavia]] as a young man, Augustus returned late one night to his lodgings (without a key) to find no one awake to let him in. Climbing up to a balcony, he was able to enter through a window, and at once sought out the maidservant, who should have been awake to admit him. On checking her room, however, he found her lying unconscious - beyond rousing - on the floor. The following morning he tried to question her on the matter, but she would only reply that she had been 'on a journey'.\n\nBartolommeo's second account is more suggestive and points toward another element in the witches' 'flights'. It concerns a certain [[notary]] of [[Lugano]] who, unable to find his wife one morning, searched for her all over their estate and finally discovered her lying deeply unconscious, naked and filthy with her vagina exposed, in a corner of the pigsty. The notary 'immediately understood that she was a witch' (!) and at first wanted to kill her on the spot, but, thinking better of such rashness, waited until she recovered from her stupor, in order to question her. Terrified by his wrath, the poor woman fell to her knees and confessed that during the night she had 'been on a journey'.\n\nLight is cast on the tale of the notary's wife by two accounts widely separated in time but revealing a persistent theme in European Witchcraft. The first is that of [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] whose ''De synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis libri duo'' (circa 906 C.E.) speaks of women who 'seduced...by demons...insist that they ride at night ''on certain beasts'' [italics not original] together with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the pagans, and a great multitude of women; that they cover great distances in the silence of the deepest night...'<ref>Quoted in : Ginzburg, Carlo, ''Ecstasies.

Siri claimed that when she was seven her grandmother had taken her to the witches' sabbath on the mountain meadow [[Blockula]] ('blue-hill') : her grandmother led her to a pigsty, where she smeared a [[Domestic pig|sow]] with some ointment which she took from a [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], whereupon grandmother and granddaughter mounted the animal and, after a short ride through the air, arrived at a building on the Sabbath mountain.<ref>Quoted in Pickering, David : ''A Dictionary of Witchcraft'' pub.

It is also a very early account of such practices, pre-dating by some centuries [[witch trials in the early modern period]]. The testimony of Dame Kyteler's maidservant, [[Petronilla de Meath]], while somewhat compromised by having been extracted under [[torture]], contains references not only to her mistress's abilities in the preparation of 'magical' medicines, but also her sexual behaviour, including at least one instance of (alleged) intercourse with a [[demon]].<ref>Williams, Bernadette, 'The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler,' History Ireland Vol. 2, No.4 (Winter, 1994)</ref><ref>Davidson, Sharon, and John O.

Asheville, NC: Pegasus Press, 2004.</ref>\nAccording to the inquisition ('in which were five knights and numerous nobles') set in motion by Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of [[Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]], there was in the city of [[Kilkenny]] a band of [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] sorcerers, at the head of whom was Dame Alice Kyteler and against whom no fewer than seven charges relating to witchcraft were laid. The fifth charge is of particular interest in the context of the 'greased staffe' mentioned above :\n{{quote|In order to [[Aphrodisiac|arouse feelings of love]] or hatred, or to inflict death or disease on the bodies of the faithful, they made use of powders, [[unguent]]s, ointments and candles of fat, which were compounded as follows. They took the entrails of cocks sacrificed to demons, certain horrible worms, various unspecified herbs, dead men's nails, the hair, brains, and shreds of the cerements of boys who were buried unbaptized, with other abominations, all of which they cooked, with various incantations, over a fire of oak-logs in a vessel made out of the skull of a decapitated thief.<ref>Seymour, St. John D. ''Irish Witchcraft and Demonology'' pub. Dorset Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88029-734-4}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}}}\nDeducting from the above ingredients of purely symbolic significance relating to death and heresy, one is left with the cooking, in a [[Animal fat|fatty]] mixture, of 'unspecified herbs' and 'horrible worms' to produce, among other preparations, 'unguents' and 'ointments' - one of which was the 'staffe-greasing' ointment later found in the 'pipe' discovered in Dame Alice's closet. It is unfortunate that the identities of the herbs and 'worms' involved went unrecorded. Those of the 'unspecified herbs' may well be guessed at in the light of information regarding later flying ointment recipes, but the 'horrible worms' remain more cryptic : it is unclear whether actual worms or insect larvae are intended. If the latter, such larvae might themselves have been poisonous and intoxicating, from having fed on alkaloidal plants.\n\nComparison of Alice Kyteler's 'staffe' and Siri J\u00f8rgensdatter's sow - both greased with a mysterious ointment, suggest the innate conservatism of European Witchcraft and the persistence of a body of women's knowledge related to sexuality and the use of a potent and complex drug.\n\n==Possible opiate component==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Die Giftpflanzen Deutschlands (1910) (20738415388).jpg|thumb|Opium Poppy : ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'']]\nOne possible key to how individuals dealt with the toxicity of the nightshades usually said to be part of flying ointments is through the supposed antidotal reaction some of the solanaceous alkaloids have with the alkaloids of ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'' (opium poppy). This is discussed by Alexander Kuklin in his brief book, ''How Do Witches Fly?'' (DNA Press, 1999). This antagonism was claimed to exist by the movement of [[Eclectic medicine]]. For instance, [[King's American Dispensatory]] states in the entry on belladonna: \"Belladonna and opium appear to exert antagonistic influences, especially as regards their action on the brain, the spinal cord, and heart; they have consequently been recommended and employed as antidotes to each other in cases of poisoning\" going on to make the extravagant claim that \"this matter is now positively and satisfactorily settled; hence in all cases of poisoning by belladonna the great remedy is morphine, and its use may be guided by the degree of pupillary contraction it occasions.\" The use of opiates in the treatment of belladonna poisoning is, however, strongly contraindicated in modern medical practice [see below].\n\nThe synergy between belladonna and poppy alkaloids was made use of in the so-called \"[[twilight sleep]]\" that was provided for women during [[childbirth]] beginning in the [[Edwardian era]]. Twilight sleep was a mixture of [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], a belladonna alkaloid, and [[morphine]], a ''[[Papaver]]'' alkaloid, that was injected and which furnished a combination of painkilling and amnesia for a woman in labor. A version is still manufactured for use as the injectable compound ''[[Omnopon]]''.\n\nThere is no definite indication of the proportions of solanaceous herbs vs. poppy used in flying ointments, and most historical recipes for flying ointment do not include poppy.\nFurthermore, a reputable publication by the former UK [[Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries]] (now [[DEFRA]]) states specifically that, in cases of poisoning by ''Atropa belladonna'' - far from being antidotes - 'Preparations containing morphine or opiates should be ''avoided'' as they have a [[synergic]] action with atropine'; an appropriate antidote being, by contrast, the [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]] [[physostigmine]] salicylate.<ref>Cooper, Marion R. and Johnson, Anthony W.

HMSO London, 1984 {{ISBN|0 11 242529 1}} page 213</ref>\n\n== Sources citing ointments ==\n\nThe use by witches of flying ointments was first described, according to known sources, by [[Johannes Hartlieb]] in 1456{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. \nIt was also described by the Spanish theologian [[Alfonso Tostado]] (d. 1455) in ''Super Genesis Commentaria'' (printed in Venice, 1507), whose commentary tended to accredit the thesis of the reality of the [[Witches' Sabbath]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1477 Antone Rose confessed that the devil gave her a stick 18 inches in length on which she would rub an ointment and with the words \"go, in the name of the Devil, go\" would fly to the \"synagogue\" (an alternative name for Sabbath in early witchcraft).<ref>Encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology, Page 50, octopus, 1974</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Drama===\nThere is, in the work of the playwright [[Francisco de Rojas Zorilla]] (1607-1648) of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], an exchange concerning the flying ointment, the (following) passage occurring in the play\n''Lo que quer\u00eda el Marqu\u00e9s de Villena'' ('What the Marquis of Villena wanted').<ref>Quoted in :  Baroja, Julio Caro The World of the Witches pub. Phoenix 2001 (Original Title Las brujas y su mundo) {{ISBN|9781842122426}})</ref>\n\n{{quote|\nMarquis: Others believe that witches can fly.\n\nZambapalo: And can't they?\n\nMarquis: Certainly not, you ignorant fellow.\n\nZambapalo: Since I'm no specialist in these matters, I must ask you what happens.\n\nMarquis: They all rub themselves with ointment.\n\nZambapalo: And then what?\n\nMarquis: The ointment, which is an opiate made of [[henbane]] given them by the Devil, sends them to sleep, and they dream such a dream that they think they are not dreaming at all. And since the Devil has great power to deceive, he makes them all dream the same dream. And that is why they think they are flying through the air, when they are really fast asleep. And although they never fly at all, they think, as soon as they wake, that they have all been to see the calf, and all visited the fields at [[Baraona]]. When, by God, in reality, more than two of them have been seen sleeping in their rooms with the ointment on them.}}\n\n===Literature and film===\n*In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s \"[[Young Goodman Brown]]\", Goody Cloyse, after meeting the Devil, says \"I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf's bane\" to which the Devil replies \"[m]ingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe\".\n*In [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', Margarita, after agreeing to act as hostess at [[Woland|Dr Woland's]] ball, uses the ointment to become a witch and fly to the estate where the event is being held.\n*In [[Clayton Rawson]]'s ''[[Death from a Top Hat]]'', two recipes by [[Johann Weyer]], a 16th-century demonologist, are given in a footnote:\n\n:1-Water hemlock, [[sweet flag]], [[cinquefoil]], bat's blood, [[deadly nightshade]] and oil.\n:2-Baby's fat, juice of [[cowbane]], [[aconitine|aconite]], cinquefoil, deadly nightshade and [[soot]].\n\n* In the movie serial ''[[Warlock (1989 film)|Warlock]]'', the villain kills an unbaptised boy to get this \"Flying Ointment\".\n*In [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''[[Salem Falls]]'', a group of four girls practicing witchcraft ingest a flying ointment made of belladonna.\n* In the book ''[[Calling on Dragons]]'' (Book three of the [[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]]), the witch Morwen uses a flying potion on a straw basket and a [[broomstick]], not on herself.\n* In [[E. L. Konigsburg]]'s ''[[Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth]]'', two characters try to make a flying ointment.\n* In the 2015 horror film ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', a witch kills an infant child and makes flying ointment out of his corpse.\n*In the 2016 movie, The Love Witch, the main character applies a flying ointment to her body.\n* In the 2019 movie, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, the two main characters apply a flying ointment to their armpits.\n* In the 2020 movie, ''Gretel and Hansel'', directed by Oz Perkins, the witch, caressing a precious jar filled with ointment, applies it to herself, and then initiates Gretel into witchcraft by inducing her to do the same.\n\n===Music===\n* The [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] song '11 Moustachioed Daughters' - a track on the Album ''[[The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse]]'' - is a darkly comic and surprisingly detailed evocation of the traditional Witches' Sabbath, featuring the flying-ointment-related lines :\n{{quote|'and belladonna, to make your eyes like a...beast's!\n                      To anoint the body and make it shine,\n\n                       To drink and make thyself divine,\n                      To choose another's form and make it...thine!'}}\n\n* The Swedish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Therion (band)|Therion]] has a song called Unguentum Sabbati (Ointment of the Sabbat) on the album ''[[Sitra Ahra]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Illustration Aconitum napellus0.jpg|Wolfsbane or Aconite, ''[[Aconitum napellus]]'' (virulent poison)\n               File:Illustration Conium maculatum0.jpg|Hemlock, ''[[Conium maculatum]]'' (virulent poison)\n               File:Illustration Cicuta virosa0.jpg|Cowbane or Water Hemlock, ''[[Cicuta virosa]]'' (virulent poison)\n               File:Herbier de la France (10038460935).jpg|Hemlock Water Dropwort or Water Hemlock, ''[[Oenanthe crocata]]'' (virulent poison)\n               File:Sium latifolium Sturm13.jpg|Greater Water Parsnip or Sium, ''[[Sium latifolium]]'' (root poisonous)\n               File:Illustration Berula erecta0.jpg|Lesser Water Parsnip or Sium, ''[[Berula erecta]]''\n               File:Illustration Aethusa cynapium0.jpg|Fool's Parsley ''[[Aethusa cynapium]]'' (poison)\n               File:Illustration Apium graveolens0.jpg|Wild Celery ''[[Apium graveolens]]'' (wild form of well-known vegetable)\n               File:Illustration Potentilla reptans0.jpg|Creeping Cinquefoil, ''[[Potentilla reptans]]''\n               File:Acorus calamus - K\u00f6hler\u2013s Medizinal-Pflanzen-006.jpg|Sweet Flag or Strewing Rush, ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' (aromatic)\n               File:Soot, roet.jpg|Domestic [[chimney]] [[soot]]\n               File:Adeps Humanus IMG 1893 edit.jpg|[[Human fat]]\n               File:Pipistrellus flight2.jpg|[[Common pipistrelle]] in flight (bat's blood)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Besom]]\n* [[Cunning folk]]\n* [[Hedgewitch]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713235155/http://www.shanmonster.com/witch/flying.html Flying Potions and Getting to the Sabbat]\n* [http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/belladonna.htm Belladonna] in flying ointments\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092926/http://www.traditionalwitchcraft.org/raven.html Ritual of the Raven]\n* [http://www.chasclifton.com/papers/If_Witches_No_Longer_Fly.pdf If Witches No Longer Fly: Today's Pagans and the Solanaceous Plants]\n* [http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/atropa.html King's American Dispensatory on Belladonna]\n* [http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/flying_ointments.html FLYING OINTMENTS: Their Ingredients and Their Use]\n* [http://www.answers.com/topic/witches-ointment Witches' Ointment: Information from the Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology]\n\n{{witchcraft}}\n\n[[Category:Witchcraft]]\n[[Category:Hallucinations]]\n[[Category:Poisons]]\n", "name_user": "MountainTraveler", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixing hyperlink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ointment"}

He works part-time at Pa Grape's store doing various jobs and tasks. He enjoys doing things like reading, studying the weather with his weather machine, and helping out his friends in the city. \n*[[Larry the Cucumber]] (voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]]) \u2013 Best friends and roommate with Bob the Tomato, Larry is scatterbrained and has an energetic, childlike personality. He enjoys doing very silly things, like singing silly songs, eating large amounts of sardines, and riding his bicycle on the ceiling. He works driving the town's ice-cream cart and does odd jobs at Pa Grape's store. He secretly protects the city from crime as the superhero LarryBoy, making use of a LarryMobile and a secret lair underneath the apartment he shares with Bob.\n*[[Laura Carrot]] (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) \u2013 A young carrot girl who is friends with Bob and Larry and Junior Asparagus, her best friend. She loves playing with her friends, including baseball and jump rope.

Like Larry, he also has a superhero altermego, \"Junior Jetpack,\" using a jet pack given to him by Ichabeezer. Junior is often a superhero duo with LarryBoy.\n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Archibald Asparagus]] (voiced by Phil Vischer) \u2013 The Mayor of the town with an upper crust British accent. He enjoys being the mayor and leader of the city, but more often than not, he can be overwhelmed by the amount of work he does. He often acts as a judge/impartial third party whenever something is wrong.\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Pa Grape]] (voiced By Phil Vischer) \u2013 A wise old grape, he runs a convenience store called Pa's Corner Store. He often provides wise and insightful advice to his friends and customers. He now has eyes.\n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Jimmy and Jerry Gourd]] (voiced by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki) - Brothers that live together in an apartment not far from Bob and Larry's house. They don't do much, but they love to eat and spend time with their pet dust bunny Danny, and their other pet guppy named Happy Sunshine Bubbles. Jimmy also gained a superhero alter ego by the name of JimmyBoy, where LarryBoy has taken Jimmy under his wing and  trained him to be a superhero. \n*[[Petunia Rhubarb]] (voiced by Tress MacNeille) \u2013 Good friends with Bob, Larry, and Tina Celerina. She often enjoys hanging out with them and often offers them advice whenever they get into a fight or face personal problems. She worked part-time at Pa Grape's store, but followed her love of plants and has opened a flower shop. \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Ichabeezer]] (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 Ichabeezer is a grumpy, gruff and elderly zucchini. He doesn't like or get along very well with the other veggies, especially when they get on his lawn. They only thing Ichabeezer truly likes is his beloved pet olive dog, Rooney. For the ''Netflix'' era, he has essentially assumed Mr. Nezzer's role as an outsider/villain foil for Bob and Larry. His home is a large mansion built out of the side of a couch. \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters#The French Peas|Jean-Claude and Phillipe Pea]] (Voiced by Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer) \u2013 The brothers, Jean-Claude and Phillipe, are peas with French accents.

She lives in a blue, teapot shaped house, where she spends most of her time drinking tea and enjoying the \"fancier\" things in life. She has been known to win various contests and events around town such as karaoke and pie baking. She has an especially lovely singing-voice and has a specialty for singing \"the blues.\" \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Mr. Lunt]] (voiced by Phil Vischer) \u2013 A Hispanic gourd, he works around the city and sells various items, often joking that his job changes every episode. He eventually set up his own place of business, where he can be seen doing his various odd jobs. Carrying on from the original videos, his lack of eyes is a running gag throughout the show.\n*Bacon Bill (voiced by Rob Paulsen) \u2013 An eccentric genius who is the son of one of Pa Grape's friends. He looks up to Larry as an older brother figure. He is very wacky, and can often be seen doing various silly things, mostly on Ichabeezer's lawn. \n*Tina Celerina (voiced by Tress MacNeille) \u2013 Petunia's best friend and employee of her flower shop. She is very scatterbrained and quirky, which can get her into trouble. Despite this, she has a very positive attitude and an outgoing personality. \n*Motato (voiced by Rob Paulsen) \u2013 An evil, deformed Sweet Potato who is LarryBoy's chief nemesis. He is quite insane and enjoys wreaking havoc and chaos on the veggie citizens of the house. Along with his radish minions, he carries out various nefarious plots to destroy the city.

He works part-time at Pa Grape's store doing various jobs and tasks. He enjoys doing things like reading, studying the weather with his weather machine, and helping out his friends in the city. \n*[[Larry the Cucumber]] (voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]]) \u2013 Best friends and roommate with Bob the Tomato, Larry is scatterbrained and has an energetic, childlike personality. He enjoys doing very silly things, like singing silly songs, eating large amounts of sardines, and riding his bicycle on the ceiling. He works driving the town's ice-cream cart and does odd jobs at Pa Grape's store. He secretly protects the city from crime as the superhero LarryBoy, making use of a LarryMobile and a secret lair underneath the apartment he shares with Bob.\n*[[Laura Carrot]] (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) \u2013 A young carrot girl who is friends with Bob and Larry and Junior Asparagus, her best friend.

He enjoys being the mayor and leader of the city, but more often than not, he can be overwhelmed by the amount of work he does. He often acts as a judge/impartial third party whenever something is wrong.\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Pa Grape]] (voiced By Phil Vischer) \u2013 A wise old grape, he runs a convenience store called Pa's Corner Store. He often provides wise and insightful advice to his friends and customers. He now has eyes.\n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Jimmy and Jerry Gourd]] (voiced by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki) - Brothers that live together in an apartment not far from Bob and Larry's house. They don't do much, but they love to eat and spend time with their pet dust bunny Danny, and their other pet guppy named Happy Sunshine Bubbles. Jimmy also gained a superhero alter ego by the name of JimmyBoy, where LarryBoy has taken Jimmy under his wing and  trained him to be a superhero. \n*[[Petunia Rhubarb]] (voiced by Tress MacNeille) \u2013 Good friends with Bob, Larry, and Tina Celerina. She often enjoys hanging out with them and often offers them advice whenever they get into a fight or face personal problems. She worked part-time at Pa Grape's store, but followed her love of plants and has opened a flower shop. \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Ichabeezer]] (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 Ichabeezer is a grumpy, gruff and elderly zucchini. He doesn't like or get along very well with the other veggies, especially when they get on his lawn. They only thing Ichabeezer truly likes is his beloved pet olive dog, Rooney. For the ''Netflix'' era, he has essentially assumed Mr. Nezzer's role as an outsider/villain foil for Bob and Larry. His home is a large mansion built out of the side of a couch. \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters#The French Peas|Jean-Claude and Phillipe Pea]] (Voiced by Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer) \u2013 The brothers, Jean-Claude and Phillipe, are peas with French accents.

She lives in a blue, teapot shaped house, where she spends most of her time drinking tea and enjoying the \"fancier\" things in life. She has been known to win various contests and events around town such as karaoke and pie baking. She has an especially lovely singing-voice and has a specialty for singing \"the blues.\" \n*[[List of VeggieTales characters|Mr. Lunt]] (voiced by Phil Vischer) \u2013 A Hispanic gourd, he works around the city and sells various items, often joking that his job changes every episode. He eventually set up his own place of business, where he can be seen doing his various odd jobs. Carrying on from the original videos, his lack of eyes is a running gag throughout the show.\n*Bacon Bill (voiced by Rob Paulsen) \u2013 An eccentric genius who is the son of one of Pa Grape's friends. He looks up to Larry as an older brother figure. He is very wacky, and can often be seen doing various silly things, mostly on Ichabeezer's lawn. \n*Tina Celerina (voiced by Tress MacNeille) \u2013 Petunia's best friend and employee of her flower shop. She is very scatterbrained and quirky, which can get her into trouble. Despite this, she has a very positive attitude and an outgoing personality. \n*Motato (voiced by Rob Paulsen) \u2013 An evil, deformed Sweet Potato who is LarryBoy's chief nemesis. He is quite insane and enjoys wreaking havoc and chaos on the veggie citizens of the house. Along with his radish minions, he carries out various nefarious plots to destroy the city.

{"title_page": "Budan's theorem", "text_new": "In mathematics, '''Budan's theorem''' is a theorem for bounding the number of real roots of a polynomial in an interval, and computing the [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] of this number. It was published in 1807 by [[Fran\u00e7ois Budan de Boislaurent]]. \n\nA similar theorem was published independently by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1820. Each of these theorems are a corollary of the other. Fourier's statement appears more often in the literature of 19th century and has been referred to as '''Fourier's''', '''Budan\u2013Fourier''', '''Fourier\u2013Budan''', and even Budan's theorem  \n\nBudan's original formulation is used in fast modern algorithms for [[real-root isolation]] of polynomials.\n\n==Sign variation==\nLet <math>c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots c_k</math> be a finite sequence of real numbers. A ''sign variation'' or ''sign change'' in the sequence is a pair of indices {{math|''i'' < ''j''}} such that <math>c_ic_j < 0,</math> and either {{math|1=''j'' = ''i'' + 1}} or <math> c_k = 0 </math> for all {{mvar|k}} such that {{math|''i'' < ''k'' < ''j''}}.\n\nIn other words, a sign variation occurs in the sequence at each place where the signs change, when ignoring zeros. \n\nFor studying the real roots of a polynomial, the number of sign variations of several sequences may used.

Thus the sequences considered in Sturm's theorem and in Budan's theorem have the same number of sign variations.\n\nThis strong relationship between the two theorems may explain the priority controversy that occurred in 19th century, and the use of several names for the same theorem. In modern usage, for computer computation, Budan's theorem is generally preferred since the sequences have much larger coefficients in Fourier's theorem than in Budan's, because of the factorial factor.\n\n==Proof==\nAs each theorem is a corollary of the other, it suffices to prove Fourier's theorem.\n\nThus, consider a polynomial {{math|''p''(''x'')}}, and an interval {{math|(''l'',''r'']}}. When the value of {{mvar|x}} increases from {{mvar|l}} to {{mvar|r}}, the number of sign variations in the sequence of the derivatives of {{mvar|p}} may change only when the value of {{mvar|x}} pass through a root of {{mvar|p}} or one of its derivatives. \n\nLet us denote by {{mvar|f}} either the polynomial {{mvar|p}} or any of its derivatives. For any root {{mvar|h}} of multiplicity {{mvar|m}} of {{mvar|f}}, this polynomial is well approximated near {{mvar|h}} by <math>a(x-h)^m</math> for some constant {{mvar|a}}. Moreover, for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''m''}}, its {{mvar|i}}th derivative is approximated by <math>\\textstyle a(x-h)^{m-i}\\prod_{j=1}^i (m-j+1).</math> It follows that, in the sequence formed by {{mvar|f}} and its {{mvar|m}} first derivatives, there are {{mvar|m}} sign variations for {{math|''x'' < ''h''}} and zero for {{math|''x'' \u2265 ''h''}}.\n\nThis shows that, when {{mvar|x}} increases and pass through a root of {{mvar|p}} of multiplicity {{mvar|m}}, then the number of sign variations in the sequence of the derivative decreases of {{mvar|m}}.\n\nNow, for {{math|''i'' > 0}}, let {{mvar|h}} be a root of the {{mvar|i}}th derivative <math>f=p^{(i)}</math> of {{mvar|p}}, which is not a root of <math>p^{(i-1)}.</math> There are two cases to be considered. If the multiplicity {{mvar|m}} of the root {{mvar|h}} is even, then <math>f=p^{(i)}</math> and <math>p^{(i-1)}</math> keep a constant sign when {{mvar|x}} pass through {{mvar|h}}. This implies that the number of sign of variation in the sequence of derivatives decrease by the even number {{mvar|m}}. On the other hand, if {{mvar|m}} is odd, <math>f=p^{(i)}</math> changes of sign at {{mvar|h}}, while <math>p^{(i-1)}</math> does not. There are thus {{math|''m'' + 1}} sign variations. Thus, when {{mvar|x}} pass through {{mvar|h}}, the number of sign variation decrease either of {{math|''m''}} or {{math|''m'' + 1}}, which are nonnegative even numbers in each case.\n\n==History==\nThe problem of counting and locating the real roots of a polynomial started to be systematically studied only in\nthe beginning of the 19th. \n\nIn 1807, [[Fran\u00e7ois Budan de Boislaurent]] discovered a method for extending [[Descartes' rule of signs]]\u2014valid for the interval {{math|(0, +\u221e)}}\u2014to any interval.<ref name=nmethode>{{cite book|last=Budan|first=Fran\u00e7ois D.|title=Nouvelle m\u00e9thode pour la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques|year=1807|publisher=Courcier|location=Paris|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyMOAAAAQAAJ}}</ref> \n\n[[Joseph Fourier]] published a similar theorem in 1820,<ref name=Fourier>{{cite journal|last=Fourier|first=Jean Baptiste Joseph|title=Sur l'usage du th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Descartes dans la recherche des limites des racines|year=1820|journal=Bulletin des Sciences, par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philomatique de Paris|pages=156\u2013165|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletindesscien20soci}}</ref> on which he worked for more than twenty years.<ref name=arago>{{citation|last=Arago|first=Fran\u00e7ois|title=Biographies of distinguished scientific men|year=1859|publisher=Ticknor and Fields (English Translation)|page=383|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGgSAAAAIAAJ}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the similarity between the two theorems, there was a priority controversy,<ref name=BF>{{cite journal|last=Akritas|first=Alkiviadis G.|title=On the Budan\u2013Fourier Controversy|journal=ACM SIGSAM Bulletin|year=1981|volume=15|number=1|pages=8\u201310|doi=10.1145/1089242.1089243}}</ref><ref name=Reflections>{{cite journal|last=Akritas|first=Alkiviadis G.|title=Reflections on a Pair of Theorems by Budan and Fourier|jstor=2690097|year=1982|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=55|number=5|pages=292\u2013298|doi=10.2307/2690097}}</ref> despite the fact that the two theorems were discovered independently.<ref name=arago /> It was generally Fourier's formulation and proof that were used, during the 19th century, in textbooks on the [[theory of equations]].\n\n=== Use in 19th century ===\n\nBudan's and Fourier's theorems were soon considered of a great importance, although they do not solve completely the problem of counting the number of real roots of a polynomial in an interval.
