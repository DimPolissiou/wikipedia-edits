It was the first FIFA World Cup held in a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]]. The tournament was won by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who beat [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 5\u20132 in the final in the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Solna]] for their first title. The tournament is also notable for marking the debut on the world stage of a then 17-year-old [[Pel\u00e9]].\n\n== Host selection ==\n{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}\nArgentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden expressed interest in hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"norlin2425\" /> Swedish delegates lobbied other countries at the FIFA Congress held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] around the opening of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup finals]].<ref name=\"norlin2425\">Norlin, pp.24\u201325</ref> Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/81/ip-201_13a_fwc-host.pdf|title=FIFA World Cup: host announcement decision|date=12 March 2009|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2 October 2011|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|1958 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nThe hosts ([[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]) and the defending champions ([[Germany national football team|West Germany]]) qualified automatically. Of the remaining 14 places, nine were allocated to Europe, three to South America, one to North/Central America, and one to Asia/Africa.\n\nAside from the main European zone matches, [[Wales national football team|Wales]], which finished second in its group behind [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], was drawn into a play-off with [[Israel national football team|Israel]] after Israel won its group by default because its three opponents, [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] and [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]], refused to play. FIFA had imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match, something that had happened in several previous World Cups. Wales won the play-off and qualified for the first, and so far only, time. With [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] making its debut, and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] also qualifying, this World Cup was the only one to feature all four of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Home Nations]].\n\nThis World Cup also saw the entry and qualification of the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] for the first time, while Argentina appeared for the first time since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Until [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], this FIFA World Cup was the only one for which [[Italy national football team|Italy]] failed to qualify (Italy did not take part in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 tournament]] but there was no qualification for that competition). Other teams that failed to qualify included two-time champions and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] semifinalists [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], as well as the [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] national teams.\n\nOn 8 February 1958, in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], [[Lennart Hyland]] and [[Sven Jerring]] presented the results of the draw where the qualified teams were divided into four groups. Seeding was geographical rather than by team strength, with each group containing one western European team, one eastern European team, one of the four British teams that had qualified, and one from the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e_fwcdraw-history_8842.pdf |title=History of the World Cup Final Draw |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===List of qualified teams===\n\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n{{col begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC]] (0)\n* None qualified\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|CAF]] (0)\n* None qualified\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification#North, Central America and Caribbean|NAFC]] (1)\n* {{fb|MEX|1934}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification#North, Central America and Caribbean|CCCF]] (0)\n* None qualified\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|CONMEBOL]] (3)\n* {{fb|ARG}}\n* {{fb|BRA|1889}}\n* {{fb|PAR|1954}}\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] (12)\n* {{fb|AUT}}\n* {{fb|TCH}}\n* {{fb|ENG}}\n* {{fb|French Fourth Republic}}\n* {{fb|HUN}}\n* {{fb|NIR}}\n* {{fb|SCO}}\n* {{fb|URS|1955}} \n* {{fb|SWE}} (hosts)\n* {{fb|WAL|1953}}\n* {{fb|FRG}} (title holders)\n* {{fb|YUG}}\n{{col-4}}\n[[File:1958 world cup.png|left|thumb|upright=2.0|Qualifying countries and their results]]\n{{col end}}\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe format of the competition changed from [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]]: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played each of the other teams in its group at least once, without extra time in the event of a draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then [[goal average]] would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off.<ref name=\"Norlin117\" /> This was overturned when the [[Swedish Football Association]] complained, ostensibly that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.<ref name=\"Norlin117\">Norlin, p.117</ref>\n\nThis was the first time that goal average was available to separate teams in a World Cup. It was used to separate the teams finishing first and second in one of the groups. However, all three playoffs finished with decisive results and so it was not needed to separate the teams involved in a tied playoff.\n\nAlmost all the matches kicked off simultaneously in each of the three rounds of the group phase, as did the quarter-finals and semi-finals. The exceptions were Sweden's three group matches, all of which were televised by [[Sveriges Radio]]; these started at other times so Swedes could attend other matches without missing their own team's. Apart from these, one match per round was televised, and relayed across Europe by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). Many Swedes bought their first television for the World Cup.\n\nThe official ball was the \"Top-Star VMbollen 1958\" model made by Sydsvenska L\u00e4der & Remfabriks AB (aka \"Remmen\" or \"Sydl\u00e4der\") in [[\u00c4ngelholm]]. It was chosen from 102 candidates in a blind test by four FIFA officials.<ref name=\"Norlin\">Norlin, pp.130\u20136</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balones-oficiales.com/mundial1958.htm|title=Top Star 1958|publisher=balones-oficiales.com|accessdate=17 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132522/http://www.balones-oficiales.com/mundial1958.htm|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n\n[[File:1958 Football World Cup poster.jpg|thumb|Official 1958 FIFA World Cup poster.]]\n\nIn Group 4, [[Pel\u00e9]] did not play until the last of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s group games, against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]]. He failed to score, but Brazil won the game 2\u20130 (much thanks to an impressive exhibition of dribbling prowess by his partner [[Garrincha]]) and the group by two points. Previously, they had drawn 0\u20130 with England in what was the first ever goalless game in World Cup history. Eventually, the Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game, in which [[Anatoli Ilyin]] scored in the 67th minute to knock England out, while [[Austria national football team|Austria]] had already been eliminated. The English side had been weakened by the [[Munich air disaster]] earlier in the year, which killed three internationals on the books of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], including England's young star [[Duncan Edwards]].\n\nPlayoffs were also needed in Group 1 ([[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] beat [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] to join the defending champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the quarter-finals) and Group 3 ([[Wales national football team|Wales]] topped [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] to advance with hosts [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]). Hungary had become a spent force after their appearance in the final of the previous tournament. They had lost their best players two years before, when they fled in the wake of [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|the failed uprising]] against the communist regime. In a rather restrictive sense, from the 1954 team, only goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]], defender [[Jozsef Bozsik]] and forward [[N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti]] remained.\n\nIn Group 2, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] faced [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], and [[France national football team|France]]. France topped the group, with [[Just Fontaine]] netting six goals. Yugoslavia finished second, while Scotland came in last.\n\nThe quarter-finals saw France's Just Fontaine continue in similar form as in the group stage, managing another two goals as France triumphed over Northern Ireland. West Germany's [[Helmut Rahn]] put them into the semi-finals with a single goal against Yugoslavia, while Sweden went through at the expense of USSR. The other game in the quarter-finals saw Pel\u00e9 score the only goal against Wales.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Sweden continued their strong run as they defeated West Germany 3\u20131 in a vicious game that saw the German player [[Erich Juskowiak]] sent off (the first ever German player to be sent off in an international game) and German veteran forward [[Fritz Walter]] injured, which further weakened the German team (substitutes were first allowed in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]).\n\nIn the other semi-final, Brazil and France were tied 1-1 for much of the first half. However, 36 minutes into the game French captain and most experienced defender [[Robert Jonquet]] suffered broken leg in a clash with Vav\u00e1, and France was down to ten men for the rest of the game (substitutions were not allowed back then). Brazil dominated the rest of the match, as a Pel\u00e9 hat-trick gave them a 5\u20132 victory. Fontaine of France added one goal to his impressive tally.\n\nThe third place match saw Fontaine score four more goals as France defeated West Germany 6\u20133. This brought his total to 13 goals in one competition, a record that still stands.\n\n=== Final ===\nThe [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] was played in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], in the [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]]; 50,000 people watched as the Brazilians went a goal down after four minutes. However [[Vav\u00e1]] equalised shortly afterwards and then put them a goal ahead before half time. In the second half, Pel\u00e9 outshone everyone, notching two goals, including the first one where he lobbed the ball over [[Bengt Gustavsson]] then followed it with a precise volley shot. [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo|Zagallo]] added a goal in between, and Sweden managed a consolation goal.\n\nThe Final saw many records made in World Cup history that still stand {{as of|2018|lc=y}}. At age 17, Pel\u00e9 simultaneously became the youngest player to participate in, score, and win a World Cup final. Conversely, [[Nils Liedholm]] became the oldest player to score in a World Cup Final at 35 years 263 days. This final had the highest number of goals scored by a winning team (5), the highest number of total goals scored (7), and together with the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|1970]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998]] finals shares the highest goal margin of difference (3); Brazil played in all those three finals.\n\nThe game is also notable for many firsts in FIFA World Cup. With the exception of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] final group stage, this marked the first time that a World Cup host reached the final without winning it. Additionally, the match marked the first time two nations from different continents (Europe and South America) met in a World Cup final. It also marks the first and only World Cup hosted in Europe not won by a European team; a feat mirrored in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] where a World Cup hosted in the [[Americas]] was not won by a team from the Americas for the first time, with [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|Germany beating Argentina 1\u20130 at the final]].\n\n== Venues ==\nA total of twelve cities throughout the central and southern parts of Sweden hosted the tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000.<ref name=\"norlin23\" /> If [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in [[Copenhagen]] for Denmark's group matches.<ref name=\"norlin23\">Norlin, p.23</ref> The Idr\u00e6tsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification.<ref name=\"norlin23\" /> When doubts arose about whether funding would be forthcoming for rebuilding the [[Ullevi]] and [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]], the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and [[Oslo]] as contingency measures.<ref>Norlin, p.32</ref>\n\nThe Rasunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands.<ref name=\"norlin27\">Norlin, p.27</ref> Organising committee chairman Holger Berg\u00e9rus mortgaged his house to pay for this.<ref name=\"norlin27\" /> The new Malm\u00f6 Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malm\u00f6 Stadion at a new site<ref>Norlin, p.30</ref> The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup.

But this time the Germans had to contend with a real powerhouse in Argentina's team, competing for the first time since 1934. In fact, some experts{{who|date=December 2013}} thought Argentina had a very realistic chance of reaching the semi finals or even winning the World Cup this time.\n\nCzechoslovakia was a fairly strong team with a rich football tradition, and was considered to be no walk-over for the West Germans or the Argentinians, but nobody expected much from tiny newcomers Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish had already shown that they could be a danger to anyone, by knocking out double world champions Italy in the qualifying tournament for the World Cup.\n\nIn the end, the Northern Irish did pull off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup Finals history by qualifying for the quarter-finals, beating Czechoslovakia in a play-off. Finishing last in the group with a \u22125 goal differential was a horrible blow for Argentina, and on the way home the Argentinian team met the wrath of several thousand angry football fans at [[Ezeiza International Airport|Ezeiza Airport]] in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>''Mundo Deportivo'', 23 June 1958; ''El Grafico'', 27 June 1958.</ref>\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|Standings}}\n\n* Northern Ireland finished ahead of Czechoslovakia by winning a play-off\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-6}}\n\n====Play-off====\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-PO}}\n\n===Group 2===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2}}\n\nThe second group saw the largest number of goals scored in a single group in the 1958 World Cup with 31 goals in total (~5.16 goals per game).

France, despite having hosted the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 event]], had not achieved any real World Cup success, Yugoslavia had not been able to replicate their semi-final success of 1930 and Paraguay and Scotland were considered underdogs during the tournament.\n\nFrance won the group ahead of Yugoslavia and would go on to finish third.\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|Standings}}\n\n* France finished ahead of Yugoslavia on goal average\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-6}}\n\n===Group 3===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3}}\n\nThe Swedish hosts could count themselves lucky in ending up in a rather weak group which they proceeded to win fairly easily with their powerful workmanlike football. The group included [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] which had been considered by far the best team in the world some years ago \u2013 although the Hungarians could not beat [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the final of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1954]]. But the Hungarian team had been dealt a blow by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] after which star players like [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] left their homeland. Striker [[N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti]] was still playing, but he was by now 36 years old and nowhere near his previous form.\n\nIn spite of Hungary's recent travails, they were still considered a strong side and everyone expected the Hungarian players to advance from their group. The success of [[Wales national football team|Wales]] therefore was a great surprise but the Welsh managed to draw all the group games and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match to decide which nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through as the Hungarians had a goal ratio of 6\u20133 compared to 2\u20132 of Wales. As it was, Wales had the honour of meeting Brazil in the quarterfinals and becoming the recipient of young [[Pel\u00e9]]'s first World Cup goal. \n\nThe 1\u20131 draw between Wales and Mexico was the first point scored by Mexico in a World Cup, having lost all eight matches in their previous three appearances in the World Cup, as well as their first match in this group against Sweden. To date, no other team has ever lost nine consecutive games in the World Cup.\n\nThe match between Hungary and Wales in [[Sandviken]] became the northern-most World Cup match in history.\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|Standings}}\n\n* Wales finished ahead of Hungary by winning a play-off\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-6}}\n\n====Play-off====\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-PO}}\n\n===Group 4===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4}}\n\nNotwithstanding the disappointments of the previous tournaments, Brazil were considered extremely powerful, as would indeed prove to be the case. The Soviet Union were the reigning Olympic champion and Austria had won the bronze medal in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, four years earlier. And although England, weakened by the loss of several players at the [[Munich air disaster]], were not considered at their very best, they were still always a formidable team.\n\nIn the end, this group had the highest average attendance, even higher than Group 3 with the host nation, Sweden.\n\nThe quality of the football in this group did not quite live up to expectations, however. Only 15 goals were scored in the whole group, fewer than in any of the other groups. And when England and Brazil drew 0\u20130, it was the first time in World Cup history that a game ended with no goals.\n\nBrazil won the group without conceding a single goal. The teenage Pel\u00e9 played Brazil's last game against the Soviet Union. He did not score but drew wild reviews for his play. The Soviet Union, in their first World Cup, took second place.\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|Standings}}\n\n* The Soviet Union finished ahead of England by winning a play-off\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-6}}\n\n====Play-off====\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4|4-PO}}\n\n==Knockout stage==\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}\n\n===Bracket===\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|Bracket}}\n\n===Quarter-finals===\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|QF1}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|QF2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|QF3}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|QF4}}\n\n===Semi-finals===\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|SF1}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|SF2}}\n\n===Third place play-off===\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|TPP}}\n\n===Final===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Final}}\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Final|Final}}\n\n==Goalscorers==\nWith 13 goals, Just Fontaine was the top scorer in the tournament. {{as of|2018}}, no player has ever scored more goals in a single FIFA World Cup Final stage.

hosted by Sweden from 8 to 29 June. It was the first FIFA World Cup held in a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]]. The tournament was won by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who beat [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 5\u20132 in the final in the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Solna]] for their first title. The tournament is also notable for marking the debut on the world stage of a then 17-year-old [[Pel\u00e9]].\n\n== Host selection ==\n{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}\nArgentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden expressed interest in hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"norlin2425\" /> Swedish delegates lobbied other countries at the FIFA Congress held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] around the opening of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup finals]].<ref name=\"norlin2425\">Norlin, pp.24\u201325</ref> Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/81/ip-201_13a_fwc-host.pdf|title=FIFA World Cup: host announcement decision|date=12 March 2009|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2 October 2011|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|1958 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nThe hosts ([[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]) and the defending champions ([[Germany national football team|West Germany]]) qualified automatically. Of the remaining 14 places, nine were allocated to Europe, three to South America, one to North/Central America, and one to Asia/Africa.\n\nAside from the main European zone matches, [[Wales national football team|Wales]], which finished second in its group behind [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], was drawn into a play-off with [[Israel national football team|Israel]] after Israel won its group by default because its three opponents, [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] and [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]], refused to play. FIFA had imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match, something that had happened in several previous World Cups. Wales won the play-off and qualified for the first, and so far only, time. With [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] making its debut, and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] also qualifying, this World Cup was the only one to feature all four of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Home Nations]].\n\nThis World Cup also saw the entry and qualification of the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] for the first time, while Argentina appeared for the first time since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Until [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], this FIFA World Cup was the only one for which [[Italy national football team|Italy]] failed to qualify (Italy did not take part in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 tournament]] but there was no qualification for that competition). Other teams that failed to qualify included two-time champions and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] semifinalists [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], as well as the [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] national teams.\n\nOn 8 February 1958, in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], [[Lennart Hyland]] and [[Sven Jerring]] presented the results of the draw where the qualified teams were divided into four groups. Seeding was geographical rather than by team strength, with each group containing one western European team, one eastern European team, one of the four British teams that had qualified, and one from the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e_fwcdraw-history_8842.pdf |title=History of the World Cup Final Draw |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===List of qualified teams===\n\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n{{col begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC]] (0)\n* None qualified\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|CAF]] (0)\n* None qualified\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification#North, Central America and Caribbean|NAFC]] (1)\n* {{fb|MEX|1934}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification#North, Central America and Caribbean|CCCF]] (0)\n* None qualified\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|CONMEBOL]] (3)\n* {{fb|ARG}}\n* {{fb|BRA|1889}}\n* {{fb|PAR|1954}}\n{{col-4}}\n;[[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] (12)\n* {{fb|AUT}}\n* {{fb|TCH}}\n* {{fb|ENG}}\n* {{fb|French Fourth Republic}}\n* {{fb|HUN}}\n* {{fb|NIR}}\n* {{fb|SCO}}\n* {{fb|URS|1955}} \n* {{fb|SWE}} (hosts)\n* {{fb|WAL|1953}}\n* {{fb|FRG}} (title holders)\n* {{fb|YUG}}\n{{col-4}}\n[[File:1958 world cup.png|left|thumb|upright=2.0|Qualifying countries and their results]]\n{{col end}}\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe format of the competition changed from [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]]: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played each of the other teams in its group at least once, without extra time in the event of a draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then [[goal average]] would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off.<ref name=\"Norlin117\" /> This was overturned when the [[Swedish Football Association]] complained, ostensibly that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.<ref name=\"Norlin117\">Norlin, p.117</ref>\n\nThis was the first time that goal average was available to separate teams in a World Cup. It was used to separate the teams finishing first and second in one of the groups. However, all three playoffs finished with decisive results and so it was not needed to separate the teams involved in a tied playoff.\n\nAlmost all the matches kicked off simultaneously in each of the three rounds of the group phase, as did the quarter-finals and semi-finals. The exceptions were Sweden's three group matches, all of which were televised by [[Sveriges Radio]]; these started at other times so Swedes could attend other matches without missing their own team's. Apart from these, one match per round was televised, and relayed across Europe by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). Many Swedes bought their first television for the World Cup.\n\nThe official ball was the \"Top-Star VMbollen 1958\" model made by Sydsvenska L\u00e4der & Remfabriks AB (aka \"Remmen\" or \"Sydl\u00e4der\") in [[\u00c4ngelholm]]. It was chosen from 102 candidates in a blind test by four FIFA officials.<ref name=\"Norlin\">Norlin, pp.130\u20136</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balones-oficiales.com/mundial1958.htm|title=Top Star 1958|publisher=balones-oficiales.com|accessdate=17 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132522/http://www.balones-oficiales.com/mundial1958.htm|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n\n[[File:1958 Football World Cup poster.jpg|thumb|Official 1958 FIFA World Cup poster.]]\n\nIn Group 4, [[Pel\u00e9]] did not play until the last of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s group games, against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]]. He failed to score, but Brazil won the game 2\u20130 (much thanks to an impressive exhibition of dribbling prowess by his partner [[Garrincha]]) and the group by two points. Previously, they had drawn 0\u20130 with England in what was the first ever goalless game in World Cup history. Eventually, the Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game, in which [[Anatoli Ilyin]] scored in the 67th minute to knock England out, while [[Austria national football team|Austria]] had already been eliminated. The English side had been weakened by the [[Munich air disaster]] earlier in the year, which killed three internationals on the books of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], including England's young star [[Duncan Edwards]].\n\nPlayoffs were also needed in Group 1 ([[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] beat [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] to join the defending champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the quarter-finals) and Group 3 ([[Wales national football team|Wales]] topped [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] to advance with hosts [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]). Hungary had become a spent force after their appearance in the final of the previous tournament. They had lost their best players two years before, when they fled in the wake of [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|the failed uprising]] against the communist regime. In a rather restrictive sense, from the 1954 team, only goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]], defender [[Jozsef Bozsik]] and forward [[N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti]] remained.\n\nIn Group 2, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] faced [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], and [[France national football team|France]]. France topped the group, with [[Just Fontaine]] netting six goals. Yugoslavia finished second, while Scotland came in last.\n\nThe quarter-finals saw France's Just Fontaine continue in similar form as in the group stage, managing another two goals as France triumphed over Northern Ireland. West Germany's [[Helmut Rahn]] put them into the semi-finals with a single goal against Yugoslavia, while Sweden went through at the expense of USSR. The other game in the quarter-finals saw Pel\u00e9 score the only goal against Wales.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Sweden continued their strong run as they defeated West Germany 3\u20131 in a vicious game that saw the German player [[Erich Juskowiak]] sent off (the first ever German player to be sent off in an international game) and German veteran forward [[Fritz Walter]] injured, which further weakened the German team (substitutes were first allowed in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]).\n\nIn the other semi-final, Brazil and France were tied 1-1 for much of the first half. However, 36 minutes into the game French captain and most experienced defender [[Robert Jonquet]] suffered broken leg in a clash with Vav\u00e1, and France was down to ten men for the rest of the game (substitutions were not allowed back then). Brazil dominated the rest of the match, as a Pel\u00e9 hat-trick gave them a 5\u20132 victory. Fontaine of France added one goal to his impressive tally.\n\nThe third place match saw Fontaine score four more goals as France defeated West Germany 6\u20133. This brought his total to 13 goals in one competition, a record that still stands.\n\n=== Final ===\nThe [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] was played in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], in the [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]]; 50,000 people watched as the Brazilians went a goal down after four minutes. However [[Vav\u00e1]] equalised shortly afterwards and then put them a goal ahead before half time. In the second half, Pel\u00e9 outshone everyone, notching two goals, including the first one where he lobbed the ball over [[Bengt Gustavsson]] then followed it with a precise volley shot. [[M\u00e1rio Zagallo|Zagallo]] added a goal in between, and Sweden managed a consolation goal.\n\nThe Final saw many records made in World Cup history that still stand {{as of|2018|lc=y}}. At age 17, Pel\u00e9 simultaneously became the youngest player to participate in, score, and win a World Cup final. Conversely, [[Nils Liedholm]] became the oldest player to score in a World Cup Final at 35 years 263 days. This final had the highest number of goals scored by a winning team (5), the highest number of total goals scored (7), and together with the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|1970]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998]] finals shares the highest goal margin of difference (3); Brazil played in all those three finals.\n\nThe game is also notable for many firsts in FIFA World Cup. With the exception of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] final group stage, this marked the first time that a World Cup host reached the final without winning it. Additionally, the match marked the first time two nations from different continents (Europe and South America) met in a World Cup final. It also marks the first and only World Cup hosted in Europe not won by a European team; a feat mirrored in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] where a World Cup hosted in the [[Americas]] was not won by a team from the Americas for the first time, with [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|Germany beating Argentina 1\u20130 at the final]].\n\n== Venues ==\nA total of twelve cities throughout the central and southern parts of Sweden hosted the tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000.<ref name=\"norlin23\" /> If [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in [[Copenhagen]] for Denmark's group matches.<ref name=\"norlin23\">Norlin, p.23</ref> The Idr\u00e6tsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification.<ref name=\"norlin23\" /> When doubts arose about whether funding would be forthcoming for rebuilding the [[Ullevi]] and [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]], the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and [[Oslo]] as contingency measures.<ref>Norlin, p.32</ref>\n\nThe Rasunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands.<ref name=\"norlin27\">Norlin, p.27</ref> Organising committee chairman Holger Berg\u00e9rus mortgaged his house to pay for this.<ref name=\"norlin27\" /> The new Malm\u00f6 Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malm\u00f6 Stadion at a new site<ref>Norlin, p.30</ref> The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup.

But this time the Germans had to contend with a real powerhouse in Argentina's team, competing for the first time since 1934. In fact, some experts{{who|date=December 2013}} thought Argentina had a very realistic chance of reaching the semi finals or even winning the World Cup this time.\n\nCzechoslovakia was a fairly strong team with a rich football tradition, and was considered to be no walk-over for the West Germans or the Argentinians, but nobody expected much from tiny newcomers Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish had already shown that they could be a danger to anyone, by knocking out double world champions Italy in the qualifying tournament for the World Cup.\n\nIn the end, the Northern Irish did pull off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup Finals history by qualifying for the quarter-finals, beating Czechoslovakia in a play-off. Finishing last in the group with a \u22125 goal differential was a horrible blow for Argentina, and on the way home the Argentinian team met the wrath of several thousand angry football fans at [[Ezeiza International Airport|Ezeiza Airport]] in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>''Mundo Deportivo'', 23 June 1958; ''El Grafico'', 27 June 1958.</ref>\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|Standings}}\n\n* Northern Ireland finished ahead of Czechoslovakia by winning a play-off\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-6}}\n\n====Play-off====\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 1|1-PO}}\n\n===Group 2===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2}}\n\nThe second group saw the largest number of goals scored in a single group in the 1958 World Cup with 31 goals in total (~5.16 goals per game). Just Fontaine of France scored 6 of his 13 goals in the tournament, making him the tournament's top scorer going into the quarter-finals.\n\nNone of the teams in this group had been particularly successful at previous World Cups. France, despite having hosted the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 event]], had not achieved any real World Cup success, Yugoslavia had not been able to replicate their semi-final success of 1930 and Paraguay and Scotland were considered underdogs during the tournament.\n\nFrance won the group ahead of Yugoslavia and would go on to finish third.\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|Standings}}\n\n* France finished ahead of Yugoslavia on goal average\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 2|2-6}}\n\n===Group 3===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3}}\n\nThe Swedish hosts could count themselves lucky in ending up in a rather weak group which they proceeded to win fairly easily with their powerful workmanlike football. The group included [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] which had been considered by far the best team in the world some years ago \u2013 although the Hungarians could not beat [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the final of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1954]]. But the Hungarian team had been dealt a blow by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] after which star players like [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] left their homeland. Striker [[N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti]] was still playing, but he was by now 36 years old and nowhere near his previous form.\n\nIn spite of Hungary's recent travails, they were still considered a strong side and everyone expected the Hungarian players to advance from their group. The success of [[Wales national football team|Wales]] therefore was a great surprise but the Welsh managed to draw all the group games and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match to decide which nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through as the Hungarians had a goal ratio of 6\u20133 compared to 2\u20132 of Wales. As it was, Wales had the honour of meeting Brazil in the quarterfinals and becoming the recipient of young [[Pel\u00e9]]'s first World Cup goal. \n\nThe 1\u20131 draw between Wales and Mexico was the first point scored by Mexico in a World Cup, having lost all eight matches in their previous three appearances in the World Cup, as well as their first match in this group against Sweden. To date, no other team has ever lost nine consecutive games in the World Cup.\n\nThe match between Hungary and Wales in [[Sandviken]] became the northern-most World Cup match in history.\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|Standings}}\n\n* Wales finished ahead of Hungary by winning a play-off\n\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-1}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-2}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-3}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-4}}\n----\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-5}}\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-6}}\n\n====Play-off====\n{{#lst:1958 FIFA World Cup Group 3|3-PO}}\n\n===Group 4===\n{{Main|1958 FIFA World Cup Group 4}}\n\nNotwithstanding the disappointments of the previous tournaments, Brazil were considered extremely powerful, as would indeed prove to be the case. The Soviet Union were the reigning Olympic champion and Austria had won the bronze medal in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, four years earlier. And although England, weakened by the loss of several players at the [[Munich air disaster]], were not considered at their very best, they were still always a formidable team.\n\nIn the end, this group had the highest average attendance, even higher than Group 3 with the host nation, Sweden.\n\nThe quality of the football in this group did not quite live up to expectations, however. Only 15 goals were scored in the whole group, fewer than in any of the other groups. And when England and Brazil drew 0\u20130, it was the first time in World Cup history that a game ended with no goals.\n\nBrazil won the group without conceding a single goal. The teenage Pel\u00e9 played Brazil's last game against the Soviet Union. He did not score but drew wild reviews for his play.

It is located at 22 Volodarsky Street. It was formerly a cathedral church.\n\n== History ==\nCatholics, mostly Poles, were present in Vladivostok since the mid-nineteenth century. The first Catholic parish in the [[Siberia]]n Far East appeared during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in the city of [[Nikolaevsk Amur]], newly founded in 1866. The city was then the seat of the Czarist Governor General of the Russian Far East.\n \nAs the imperial (later Soviet) fleet moved to Vladivostok, the new port and fortress under construction attracted a number of people who came from all corners of the Empire, including Polish Catholics, Lithuanians etc. They were artisans, merchants, simple workers or soldiers.\n \nThe municipal assembly (Duma) donated the land in 1885 until 1886. The parish itself was erected on January 11, 1890, a few months before the start of the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to Vladivostok from May 1891.\n\nFrom 1923 to 2002, Vladivostok was the cathedral episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vladivostok]], which was merged into the [[Diocese of Saint Joseph at Irkutsk]] and remains a deanery.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Roman

Diocese of Saint Joseph at Irkutsk|Diocese of Irkutsk]]. It is located at 22 Volodarsky Street. It was formerly a cathedral church.\n\n== History ==\nCatholics, mostly Poles, were present in Vladivostok since the mid-nineteenth century. The first Catholic parish in the [[Siberia]]n Far East appeared during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in the city of [[Nikolaevsk Amur]], newly founded in 1866. The city was then the seat of the Czarist Governor General of the Russian Far East.\n \nAs the imperial (later Soviet) fleet moved to Vladivostok, the new port and fortress under construction attracted a number of people who came from all corners of the Empire, including Polish Catholics, Lithuanians etc. They were artisans, merchants, simple workers or soldiers.\n \nThe municipal assembly (Duma) donated the land in 1885 until 1886. The parish itself was erected on January 11, 1890, a few months before the start of the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to Vladivostok from May 1891.\n\nFrom 1923 to 2002, Vladivostok was the cathedral episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vladivostok]], which was merged into the [[Diocese of Saint Joseph at Irkutsk]] and remains a deanery.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Russia]]\n* [[Mother of God Church, Chotyniec|Mother of God Church]]\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b. 2.jpg|thumb|Another View]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|43.1164|N|131.9114|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mother of God Church, Church}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Vladivostok]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Vladivostok]]\n[[Category:European diaspora in Siberia]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Russia]]\n[[Category:Lithuanian diaspora in Siberia]]\n[[Category:Polish diaspora in Siberia]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1890]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Russia]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures in the Russian Far East]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Russia]]\n", "name_user": "Kevin9217", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_God_Church,_Vladivostok"}

Sophie was the heiress of Hesse, which she passed on to her son, [[Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse|Henry]], upon her retention of the territory following her partial victory in the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]], in which she was one of the belligerents.<ref>Cawley, ''Thuringia''</ref>\n\nOriginally the western part of the [[Landgrave|Landgraviate]] of [[Thuringia]], in the mid 13th century, it was inherited by the younger son of Henry II, [[Duke of Brabant]], and became a distinct political entity. From the late 16th century, it was generally divided into several branches, the most important of which were those of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) and [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was elevated to [[prince-elector|Elector]] of Hesse (1803), while the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt became the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Grand Duke of Hesse]] (1806), later the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine. The [[Electorate of Hesse]] (Hesse-Kassel) was annexed by [[Prussia]] in 1866, while the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hesse-Darmstadt) remained a sovereign realm until the end of the German monarchies in 1918.\n\nSince 23 May 2013, the head of the house has been [[Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse]]. He descends from the Hesse-Kassel branch of the family, which has been the genealogically senior male line since the house's major partition in 1567. He is married to Countess Floria-Franziska of Faber-Castell.<ref>https://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/gesellschaft-hessen-prinz-heiratet-faber-castell-graefin-3341358.html</ref> They have three children together.\n\n===Links===\n*[[Rulers of Hesse]]\n*[[Faber-Castell Family]]\n\n==Branches==\n[[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], died in 1567.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>.

To increase installation of photovoltaic solar-power plants, the production of flat glass and its raw materials must expand commensurately to eliminate supply constraints or future imports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cstep.in/uploads/default/files/publications/stuff/CSTEP_Addressing_the_Challenges_of_RE_Manufacturing_in_India_Report_2015.pdf |title=Addressing the Challenges of RE Manufacturing in India |accessdate=2017-07-29}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India, has issued a memorandum to ensure the quality of solar cells and solar modules.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/the-setting-sun-on-india-s-solar-dreams-11574612085929.html |title=The setting sun on India's solar dreams |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mercomindia.com/lack-insurance-solar-modules-holding-indian-modules/ |title=Lack of Insurance for Solar Modules Holding Back India-Made Modules |accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref> Compliance with the requisite specifications will grant manufacturers and their specific products an entry in the ALMM (Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mnre.gov.in/sites/default/files/webform/notices/scan0008.pdf|title=BIS Notification for Modules}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mercomindia.com/mnre-lenders-insist-bis-certification-solar-modules/|title=MNRE Asks Lenders to Insist on BIS Certification of Solar Modules Rather than Tier-1 List}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/mnre-tells-lenders-to-favour-bis-compliant-solar-projects/articleshow/66946683.cms?from=mdr|title=MNRE tells lenders to favour BIS-compliant solar projects|access-date= 5 September 2019}}</ref> Indian manufacturers are gradually enhancing the production capacity of [[monocrystalline silicon]] [[PERC cells]] to supply better performing and enduring solar cells to local market.<ref name=mono/>\n\nFor utility scale solar projects, top solar module suppliers in 2016-17 were: Waaree energy ltd, Trina Solar, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, Hanwha and GCL Poly.<ref>{{cite web|title=India Solar Map - 2017|url=http://www.bridgetoindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/India-Solar-Map-September-2017.pdf|publisher=BRIDGE TO INDIA|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>\nFor rooftop solar projects, international companies with the largest market share in the Indian market were: Waaree energy ltd, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, Renesola, REC Solar and Jinko Solar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar panels score board |url=http://www.solarscorecard.com/2014/score-guidelines.php |accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Renewable energy in India]]\n* [[Electricity sector in India]]\n* [[Energy policy of India]]\n* [[Wind power in India]]\n* [[Biofuels in India]]\n* [[Hydroelectric power in India]]\n* [[List of types of solar cells]]\n* [[Growth of photovoltaics]]\n* [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission]]\n* [[Index of solar energy articles]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Energy in India}} \n{{SPIN}}\n{{Photovoltaics}}\n{{Solar power by country}}\n{{Renewable energy by country}}\n{{commons category|Solar energy in India}}\n\n[[Category:Electric power in Asia|India]]\n[[Category:Solar power in India| ]]\n", "name_user": "Venkats93", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_India"}

The bowl is one of the post-season contests run by [[ESPN Events]]. Since 2018, the game has been sponsored by the personal finance company [[SoFi]] and officially known as the ''SoFi Hawai'i Bowl''. Previous sponsors include [[ConAgra Foods]] (2002) and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii]] (2003\u20132013).\n\nTypically played on or near [[Christmas Eve]], the bowl normally features a team from the [[Mountain West Conference]], playing a team from either the [[American Athletic Conference]] or [[Conference USA]]. For practical and logistical reasons, the Mountain West bid is automatically awarded to the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii Rainbow Warriors]] if the team is [[bowl-eligible]], and was not selected to play in a [[New Year's Six]] (or previously [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]]) bowl game. This means that the Rainbow Warriors do not have to travel to the [[Contiguous United States|mainland]] for a bowl game unless it is of significant importance. As a result of this practice, they have also made the most appearances in the game, at nine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/12/24/14073110/hawaii-bowl-2016-game-time-tv-history|title=Why Hawaii is in the Hawaii Bowl so much|last=Kirshner|first=Alex|date=2016-12-24|website=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Bowl games in Hawaii==\nThe Hawaii Bowl is not affiliated with other bowl games previously staged in Hawaii: the [[Poi Bowl]] (1936\u20131939), [[Pineapple Bowl]] (1940\u20131941, 1947\u20131952), [[Aloha Bowl]] (1982\u20132000), and [[Oahu Bowl]] (1998\u20132000), or the [[Hula Bowl]] all-star game (1960\u20132008, and resuming in 2020). While the Aloha Bowl tried to move to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and was decertified by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the Oahu Bowl was moved to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and was held for two years as the [[Seattle Bowl]] before losing certification in 2002.\n\n==Game history==\nIn its first year, the Hawai'i Bowl was sponsored by [[ConAgra Foods, Inc.|ConAgra Foods]]. The following year, [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii]] assumed sponsorship; the game's full name was changed to the '''Sheraton Hawai'i Bowl''' until Sheraton declined to renew sponsorship in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2014/05/09/sheraton-hotels-resorts-drops-title-sponsorship-of.html?iana=ind_sports |title=Sheraton Hotels & Resorts drops title sponsorship of Hawaii Bowl college football game}}</ref>  In 2018, [[SoFi]] signed on as title sponsor of the game which is officially known as the '''SoFi Hawai'i Bowl'''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thehawaiibowl.com/hawaii-bowl-names-sofi-as-new-title-sponsor/ |title=Hawai\u2018i Bowl Names SoFi As New Title Sponsor |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current Mountain West tie-in was held by the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) until 2012, when the WAC ceased sponsoring college football, and Hawaii moved to the Mountain West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7376711/mountain-west-conference-aligns-sheraton-hawaii-bowl-starting-2012|title=Mountain West Conference aligns with Sheraton Hawaii Bowl starting in 2012|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first two editions were played on the Aloha Bowl's traditional Christmas Day date, but ESPN's [[NBA on ESPN|acquisition of NBA rights]] came with the league's [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day games]], thus the game moved to [[Christmas Eve]] after 2004 in most years.\n\nThe [[2005 Hawai'i Bowl|2005]] appearance of the [[UCF Knights football|UCF Knights]] at the Hawaii Bowl was the first ever bowl game in that school's history. In [[2006 Hawai'i Bowl|2006]], the Pac-10 replaced [[Conference USA]] (C-USA) as the WAC's opposition, with C-USA as an alternate. Since Christmas Eve fell on a Monday in [[2007 Hawai'i Bowl|2007]], the game was scheduled for the night prior (December 23) to avoid a conflict with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (also on ESPN). In [[2008 Hawai'i Bowl|2008]], the bowl organizers selected [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] as an [[at-large bid]], marking the first time an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] played in the contest. C-USA again became a primary tie-in starting in [[2009 Hawai'i Bowl|2009]]. The [[2011 Hawai'i Bowl|2011]] game featured the C-USA champion for the first time, as [[Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles football|Southern Mississippi]] played instead of going to the [[Liberty Bowl]], where the C-USA champion typically plays. The bowl featured the Mountain West champion for the first time in [[2008 Hawai'i Bowl|2015]], as [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]] played instead of going to the [[Las Vegas Bowl]], where the Mountain West champion typically plays.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2018, C-USA sent a team to the bowl 12 times, registering an 8\u20134 record. In 2019, the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American) superseded C-USA as the primary tie-in to face a Mountain West team (or independent [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]]).<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.thehawaiibowl.com/2019-sofi-hawaii-bowl-return-dec-24/ |title=2019 SoFi Hawai\u2018I Bowl to Return to Dec. 24 |website=thehawaiibowl.com |date=May 23, 2019 |accessdate=May 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Tenth Anniversary Team (2011)===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Hawai'i Bowl, the ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'', in conjunction with the bowl game, allowed fans to vote on a tenth anniversary team.

The bowl is one of the post-season contests run by [[ESPN Events]]. Since 2018, the game has been sponsored by the personal finance company [[SoFi]] and officially known as the ''SoFi Hawai'i Bowl''. Previous sponsors include [[ConAgra Foods]] (2002) and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii]] (2003\u20132013).\n\nTypically played on or near [[Christmas Eve]], the bowl normally features a team from the [[Mountain West Conference]], playing a team from either the [[American Athletic Conference]] or [[Conference USA]]. For practical and logistical reasons, the Mountain West bid is automatically awarded to the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii Rainbow Warriors]] if the team is [[bowl-eligible]], and was not selected to play in a [[New Year's Six]] (or previously [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]]) bowl game. This means that the Rainbow Warriors do not have to travel to the [[Contiguous United States|mainland]] for a bowl game unless it is of significant importance. As a result of this practice, they have also made the most appearances in the game, at nine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/12/24/14073110/hawaii-bowl-2016-game-time-tv-history|title=Why Hawaii is in the Hawaii Bowl so much|last=Kirshner|first=Alex|date=2016-12-24|website=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Bowl games in Hawaii==\nThe Hawaii Bowl is not affiliated with other bowl games previously staged in Hawaii: the [[Poi Bowl]] (1936\u20131939), [[Pineapple Bowl]] (1940\u20131941, 1947\u20131952), [[Aloha Bowl]] (1982\u20132000), and [[Oahu Bowl]] (1998\u20132000), or the [[Hula Bowl]] all-star game (1960\u20132008, and resuming in 2020). While the Aloha Bowl tried to move to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and was decertified by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the Oahu Bowl was moved to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and was held for two years as the [[Seattle Bowl]] before losing certification in 2002.\n\n==Game history==\nIn its first year, the Hawai'i Bowl was sponsored by [[ConAgra Foods, Inc.|ConAgra Foods]]. The following year, [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii]] assumed sponsorship; the game's full name was changed to the '''Sheraton Hawai'i Bowl''' until Sheraton declined to renew sponsorship in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2014/05/09/sheraton-hotels-resorts-drops-title-sponsorship-of.html?iana=ind_sports |title=Sheraton Hotels & Resorts drops title sponsorship of Hawaii Bowl college football game}}</ref>  In 2018, [[SoFi]] signed on as title sponsor of the game which is officially known as the '''SoFi Hawai'i Bowl'''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thehawaiibowl.com/hawaii-bowl-names-sofi-as-new-title-sponsor/ |title=Hawai\u2018i Bowl Names SoFi As New Title Sponsor |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current Mountain West tie-in was held by the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) until 2012, when the WAC ceased sponsoring college football, and Hawaii moved to the Mountain West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7376711/mountain-west-conference-aligns-sheraton-hawaii-bowl-starting-2012|title=Mountain West Conference aligns with Sheraton Hawaii Bowl starting in 2012|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first two editions were played on the Aloha Bowl's traditional Christmas Day date, but ESPN's [[NBA on ESPN|acquisition of NBA rights]] came with the league's [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day games]], thus the game moved to [[Christmas Eve]] after 2004 in most years.\n\nThe [[2005 Hawai'i Bowl|2005]] appearance of the [[UCF Knights football|UCF Knights]] at the Hawaii Bowl was the first ever bowl game in that school's history. In [[2006 Hawai'i Bowl|2006]], the Pac-10 replaced [[Conference USA]] (C-USA) as the WAC's opposition, with C-USA as an alternate. Since Christmas Eve fell on a Monday in [[2007 Hawai'i Bowl|2007]], the game was scheduled for the night prior (December 23) to avoid a conflict with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (also on ESPN). In [[2008 Hawai'i Bowl|2008]], the bowl organizers selected [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] as an [[at-large bid]], marking the first time an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] played in the contest. C-USA again became a primary tie-in starting in [[2009 Hawai'i Bowl|2009]]. The [[2011 Hawai'i Bowl|2011]] game featured the C-USA champion for the first time, as [[Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles football|Southern Mississippi]] played instead of going to the [[Liberty Bowl]], where the C-USA champion typically plays. The bowl featured the Mountain West champion for the first time in [[2008 Hawai'i Bowl|2015]], as [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]] played instead of going to the [[Las Vegas Bowl]], where the Mountain West champion typically plays.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2018, C-USA sent a team to the bowl 12 times, registering an 8\u20134 record. In 2019, the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American) superseded C-USA as the primary tie-in to face a Mountain West team (or independent [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]]).<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.thehawaiibowl.com/2019-sofi-hawaii-bowl-return-dec-24/ |title=2019 SoFi Hawai\u2018I Bowl to Return to Dec. 24 |website=thehawaiibowl.com |date=May 23, 2019 |accessdate=May 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Tenth Anniversary Team (2011)===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Hawai'i Bowl, the ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'', in conjunction with the bowl game, allowed fans to vote on a tenth anniversary team.

It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and [[God]] answers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00wals_1|url-access=registration|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9}}</ref>  The first book of the ''Conversations with God'' series, ''Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue'', was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on ''[[The New York Times Best Sellers List]]'' for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the ten book series also appeared prominently on the List.\n\nIn an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: \"Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?\"<ref>[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)</ref>  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he \u2018open up\u2019 to God these days, Neale stated \u201cI am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.\u201d<ref>[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]</ref>\n\n== Basis of the dialogue ==\nContaining nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.\n\n=== CwG's basic messages ===\nIn ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:\n\n# We are all one.\n# There's enough.\n# There's nothing we have to do.\n# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.\n\n[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.\n\nAccording to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.\n\n=== God's motive for creation ===\nIn Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that \"knowing\" and \"experiencing\" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.\n\nThis present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just \"know\" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, and actions are either working or not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over \"time\" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.\n\n=== Nature of the dialogue ===\n\n* '''Book 1''' ('''pg. 4''') argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books beale ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is \"taking dictation\" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. \"All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me.\" ('''Book 1, pg. 58''').\n*  [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, \"I am the way and the life, follow me\". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, \"I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren\". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) ('''Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330''').\n* Jesus is said to have said, \"without the father (God), I am nothing\". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life ('''Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180''').\n* In '''Book 3''' of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.<ref>Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.</ref> When Neale asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. \n* It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. \n* One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. \n* In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That led to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory ('''Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130''').\n\n== Parallels in other belief systems ==\nIn the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and \"God\" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:\n\n* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).\n* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).\n* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).\n* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).\n* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').\n* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])\n* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are.

The succeeding volumes in the ten book series also appeared prominently on the List.\n\nIn an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: \"Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?\"<ref>[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)</ref>  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he \u2018open up\u2019 to God these days, Neale stated \u201cI am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.\u201d<ref>[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]</ref>\n\n== Basis of the dialogue ==\nContaining nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.\n\n=== CwG's basic messages ===\nIn ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:\n\n# We are all one.\n# There's enough.\n# There's nothing we have to do.\n# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.\n\n[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.\n\nAccording to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.\n\n=== God's motive for creation ===\nIn Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that \"knowing\" and \"experiencing\" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.\n\nThis present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just \"know\" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, and actions are either working or not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over \"time\" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.\n\n=== Nature of the dialogue ===\n\n* '''Book 1''' ('''pg. 4''') argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is \"taking dictation\" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. \"All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me.\" ('''Book 1, pg. 58''').\n*  [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, \"I am the way and the life, follow me\". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, \"I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren\". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) ('''Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330''').\n* Jesus is said to have said, \"without the father (God), I am nothing\". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life ('''Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180''').\n* In '''Book 3''' of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.<ref>Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.</ref> When Neale asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. \n* It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. \n* One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. \n* In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That led to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory ('''Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130''').\n\n== Parallels in other belief systems ==\nIn the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and \"God\" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:\n\n* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).\n* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).\n* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).\n* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).\n* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').\n* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])\n* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are. ([[Sikhism]])\n* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life.<ref>[http://www.insight.poeticmind.co.uk/12-application/12-2-space-pt-4-of-6/  'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2]</ref> ([[Drewermann]])\n* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). ([[Nietzsche]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* Reality is a representation created by will. ([[Schopenhauer]]/[[Sikhism]])\n* Nobody knowingly desires evil.
