Dixon's \"Trilogy of Reconstruction\" consisted of ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]'' (1902), ''[[The Clansman]]'' (1905), and ''[[The Traitor (Dixon novel)|The Traitor]]'' (1907). (In his autobiography, he says that in creating trilogies, he was following the model of Polish novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]].{{page number needed|date=June 2019}}) Dixon's novels were best-sellers in their day, despite being [[racist]] [[pastiche]]s of [[historical romance]] fiction. They glorify a [[antebellum era|antebellum]] American South [[white supremacist]] viewpoint. Dixon claimed to oppose [[slavery]], but he espoused [[racial segregation]] and vehemently opposed universal [[suffrage]] and [[miscegenation]].<ref name=Gillespie/>{{page needed|date=May 2019}}<ref name=Slide/>{{rp|27}} He was \"a spokesman for southern [[Jim Crow]] segregation and for American racism in general. Yet he did nothing more than reiterate the comments of others.\"<ref name=Slide/>{{rp|4}}\n\nDixon's Reconstruction-era novels depict Northerners as greedy [[carpetbaggers]] and white Southerners as victims. Their prejudice and bigotry appealed to a readership that feared losing its privileged legacy of brutal oppression and exploitation.<ref name=\"Leiter 2004\">{{cite web|last=Leiter|first=Andrew|title=Thomas Dixon, Jr.: Conflicts in History and Literature|publisher=Documenting the American South|date=2004|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/dixon_intro.html|accessdate=2017-07-21}}</ref> Dixon's ''Clansman'' caricatures the Reconstruction as an era of \"black rapists\" and \"blonde-haired\" victims, and if his racist views were unknown, the vile and gratuitous brutality and Klan terror in which the novel revels would be read as [[satire]].<ref name=\"Leiter 2004\"/> If \"Dixon used the motion picture as a propaganda tool for his often outrageous opinions on race, communism, socialism, and feminism,\"<ref name=Slide/>{{page needed|date=April 2019}} [[D. W. Griffith]], in his film adaptation of the novel, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), is a case in point. Dixon wrote a highly successful stage adaptation of ''The Clansman'' in 1905. In ''The Leopard's Spots'', the Reverend Durham character indoctrinates Charles Gaston, the protagonist, with a foul-mouthed diatribe of [[hate speech]].<ref name=\"Leiter 2004\"/> One critic notes that the term for marriage, \"the [[Holy of Holies]]\", may be a crude euphemism for the [[vagina]].<ref name=\"Leiter 2004\"/> Equally, Dixon's opposition to miscegenation seemed to be as much about confused sexism as it was about racism, as he opposed relationships between white women and black men but not between black women and white men.<ref name=\"Leiter 2004\"/>\n\nAnother pet hate for Dixon and the focus of another trilogy was [[socialism]]: ''[[The One Woman: A Story of Modern Utopia]]'' (1903), ''[[Comrades: A Story of Social Adventure in California]]'' (1909), and ''[[The Root of Evil]]'' (1911), the latter of which also discusses some of the problems involved in modern industrial [[capitalism]]. The book ''Comrades'' was made into a motion picture, entitled ''[[Bolshevism on Trial]]'', released in 1919. In the play ''The Sins of the Father'', which was produced in 1910\u20131911, Dixon himself played the leading role.\n\nDixon wrote 22 novels, as well as many plays, sermons, and works of non-fiction.

Inflammation in the spinal cord, can cause the [[myelin]] and [[axon]] to be damaged resulting in symptoms such as paralysis and sensory loss. Myelitis is classified to several categories depending on the area or the cause of the lesion; however, any inflammatory attack on the spinal cord is often referred to as [[transverse myelitis]].\n\n==Types of myelitis==\n[[File:Nerve.nida.jpg|thumb|alt=Myelination surrounding the axon|Myelitis damages the myelin sheath that wraps the axon.]]\n[[File:Transverse myelitis MRI.jpg|thumb|MRI image of transverse myelitis patient's spinal cord]]\nMyelitis lesions usually occur in a narrow region but can be spread and affect many areas.\n*[[Acute flaccid myelitis]]: a polio-like syndrome that causes muscle weakness and paralysis.\n*[[Poliomyelitis]]:<ref name=\"pmid16630313\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly H | title = Evidence for a causal association between oral polio vaccine and transverse myelitis: A case history and review of the Literature | journal = J Paediatr Child Health | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 155\u20139 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16630313 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2006.00840.x }}</ref> disease caused by viral infection in the gray matter with symptoms of muscle paralysis or weakness\n*[[Transverse myelitis]]: caused by axonal [[demyelination]] encompassing both sides of the spinal cord\n*Leukomyelitis: lesions in the white matter\n*Meningococcal myelitis (or meningomyelitis): lesions occurring in the region of [[meninges]] and the spinal cord\n\nOsteomyelitis of the [[vertebra|vertebral]] bone surrounding the spinal cord (that is, [[vertebral osteomyelitis]]) is a separate condition, although some infections (for example, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection) can occasionally cause both at once. The similarity of the words reflects that the combining form ''[[wikt:myelo-#Prefix|myel(o)-]]'' has multiple ([[homonym]]ous) senses referring to bone marrow or the spinal cord.\n\n==Symptoms==\nDepending on the cause of the disease, such clinical conditions manifest different speed in progression of symptoms in a matter of hours to days. Most myelitis manifests fast progression in muscle weakness or paralysis starting with the legs and then arms with varying degrees of severity. Sometimes the dysfunction of arms or legs cause instability of posture and difficulty in walking or any movement. Also symptoms generally include [[paresthesia]] which is a sensation of tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin with no apparent long-term physical effect.

Direct infection by viruses, bacteria, mold, or parasites such as human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] types I and II (HTLV-I/II), [[syphilis]], lyme disease, and [[tuberculosis]] can cause myelitis but it can also be caused due to non-infectious or inflammatory pathway. Myelitis often follows after the infections or after vaccination. These phenomena can be explained by a theory of autoimmune attack which states that the autoimmune bodies attack its spinal cord in response to immune reaction.\n\n===Mechanism of myelitis===\nThe theory of autoimmune attack claims that a person with neuroimmunologic disorders have genetic predisposition to auto-immune disorder, and the environmental factors would trigger the disease. The specific genetics in myelitis is not completely understood. It is believed that the immune system response could be to viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection; however, it is not known why the immune system attacks itself. Especially, for the immune system to cause inflammatory response anywhere in the central nervous system, the cells from the immune system must pass through the [[blood brain barrier]]. In the case of myelitis, not only is the immune system dysfunctional, but the dysfunction also crosses this protective blood brain barrier to affect the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wearesrna.org|title=The Siegel Rare Neuroimmune Association - Advocating for individuals with rare neuroimmune disorders|author=|date=|website=The Siegel Rare Neuroimmune Association|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Infectious myelitis <ref name=\"pmid22927022\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mihai C, Jubelt B | title = Infectious myelitis | journal = Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 633\u201341 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22927022 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-012-0306-3}}</ref>===    \n\n[[Image:Polio spinal diagram-en.svg|thumb|The location of [[motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn cells]] of the [[spinal column]] will be affected by the polioviruses causing poliomyelitis.]]\n\n*[[Viral myelitis]]\nMost viral myelitis is acute, but the [[retrovirus]]es (such as HIV and HTLV) can cause chronic myelitis. [[Poliomyelitis]], or gray matter myelitis, is usually caused by infection of [[anterior horn of the spinal cord]] by the [[enterovirus]]es ([[poliovirus]]es, enteroviruses (EV) 70 and 71, [[echovirus]]es, [[coxsackievirus]]es A and B) and the [[flavivirus]]es (West Nile, [[Japanese encephalitis]], [[tick-borne encephalitis]]). On the other hand, [[transverse myelitis]] or [[leukomyelitis]], or [[white matter myelitis]], are often caused by the [[herpesvirus]]es and [[influenza virus]]. It can be due to direct viral invasion or via immune mediated mechanisms.\n\n*[[Bacterial myelitis]]\nBacterial myelitis includes ''[[Mycoplasma Pneumoniae]]'', which is a common agent for respiratory tract. Studies have shown respiratory tract infections within 4\u201339 days prior to the onset of transverse myelitis. Or, [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], and [[brucellosis]] are also known to cause myelitis in immune-compromised individuals. Myelitis is a rare manifestation of bacterial infection.\n\n*[[Fungal myelitis]]\n[[Fungi]] have been reported to cause spinal cord disease either by forming [[abscesses]] inside the bone or by [[granuloma]]. In general, there are two groups of fungi that may infect the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and cause myelitis - primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens include the following: ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', ''[[Blastomyces dermatitides]]'', and ''[[Hystoplasma capsulatum]]''. Secondary pathogens are opportunistic agents that primarily infect immunocompromised hosts such as [[Candida species]], [[Aspergillus]] species, and [[zygomycetes]].\n\n*[[Parasitic myelitis]]\nParasitic species infect human hosts through larvae that penetrate the skin. Then they enter the lymphatic and circulatory system, and migrate to liver and lung. Some reach the spinal cord. Parasitic infections have been reported with [[Schistosoma]] species, ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', [[Echinococcus]] species, ''[[Taenia solium]]'', ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', and [[Plasmodium]] species.\n\n===Autoimmune myelitis===\n\nIn 2016 it was identified in [[Mayo clinic]] an autoimmune form of myelitis due to the presence of anti-[[glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]] autoantibodies.

The type of onset (acute versus subacute/chronic) along with associated symptoms such as the presence of pain, constitutional symptoms that encompass fever, [[malaise]], weight loss or a cutaneous rash may help identify the cause of myelitis. In order to establish a diagnosis of myelitis, one has to localize the spinal cord level, and exclude cerebral and neuromuscular diseases. Also a detailed medical history, a careful neurologic examination, and imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed. In respect to the cause of the process, further work-up would help identify the cause and guide treatment.

A brain MRI may be needed to identify the extent of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

Complementary blood tests are also of value in establishing a firm diagnosis. Rarely, a biopsy of a mass lesion may become necessary when the cause is uncertain.

In these cases, ongoing treatment with medications that modulate or suppress the immune system may be necessary. Sometimes there is no specific treatment. Either way, aggressive rehabilitation and long-term symptom management are an integral part of the healthcare plan.\n\n===Prospective research direction===\nCentral nervous system nerve regeneration would be able to repair or regenerate the damage caused to the spinal cord. It would restore functions lost due to the disease.<ref>Karumbaiah, L., Bellamkonda, R.. ''Neural Tissue Engineering''.</ref>\n*Engineering endogenous repair\nCurrently, there exists a [[hydrogel]] based scaffold which acts as a channel to deliver nerve growth-enhancing substrates while providing structural support. These factors would promote nerve repairs to the target area. Hydrogels' macroporous properties would enable attachment of cells and enhance ion and nutrient exchange. In addition, hydrogels' biodegradability or bioresolvability would prevent the need for surgical removal of the hydrogel after drug delivery. It means that it would be dissolved naturally by the body's enzymatic reaction.\n*Biochemical repair\n:*Neurotropic factor therapy and gene therapy\n:*Neurotropic growth factors regulate growth, survival, and [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the [[axon]]. They benefit nerve regeneration after injury to the nervous system. They are a potent initiator of sensory axon growth and are up-regulated at the lesion site. The continuous delivery of [[neurotropic growth factor]] (NGF) would increase the nerve regeneration in the spinal cord. However, the excessive dosing of NGF often leads to undesired plasticity and sprouting of uninjured sensory nerves. Gene therapy would be able to increase the NGF efficacy by the controlled and sustained delivery in a site-specific manner.\n*[[Stem cell based therapies]]\nThe possibility for nerve regeneration after injury to the spinal cord was considered to be limited because of the absence of major [[neurogenesis]].

Inflammation in the spinal cord, can cause the [[myelin]] and [[axon]] to be damaged resulting in symptoms such as paralysis and sensory loss. Myelitis is classified to several categories depending on the area or the cause of the lesion; however, any inflammatory attack on the spinal cord is often referred to as [[transverse myelitis]].\n\n==Types of myelitis==\n[[File:Nerve.nida.jpg|thumb|alt=Myelination surrounding the axon|Myelitis damages the myelin sheath that wraps the axon.]]\n[[File:Transverse myelitis MRI.jpg|thumb|MRI image of transverse myelitis patient's spinal cord]]\nMyelitis lesions usually occur in a narrow region but can be spread and affect many areas.\n*[[Acute flaccid myelitis]]: a polio-like syndrome that causes muscle weakness and paralysis.\n*[[Poliomyelitis]]:<ref name=\"pmid16630313\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly H | title = Evidence for a causal association between oral polio vaccine and transverse myelitis: A case history and review of the Literature | journal = J Paediatr Child Health | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 155\u20139 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16630313 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2006.00840.x }}</ref> disease caused by viral infection in the gray matter with symptoms of muscle paralysis or weakness\n*[[Transverse myelitis]]: caused by axonal [[demyelination]] encompassing both sides of the spinal cord\n*Leukomyelitis: lesions in the white matter\n*Meningococcal myelitis (or meningomyelitis): lesions occurring in the region of [[meninges]] and the spinal cord\n\nOsteomyelitis of the [[vertebra|vertebral]] bone surrounding the spinal cord (that is, [[vertebral osteomyelitis]]) is a separate condition, although some infections (for example, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection) can occasionally cause both at once.

Most myelitis manifests fast progression in muscle weakness or paralysis starting with the legs and then arms with varying degrees of severity. Sometimes the dysfunction of arms or legs cause instability of posture and difficulty in walking or any movement. Also symptoms generally include [[paresthesia]] which is a sensation of tickling, tingling, burning, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin with no apparent long-term physical effect.

Direct infection by viruses, bacteria, mold, or parasites such as human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] types I and II (HTLV-I/II), [[syphilis]], lyme disease, and [[tuberculosis]] can cause myelitis but it can also be caused due to non-infectious or inflammatory pathway. Myelitis often follows after the infections or after vaccination. These phenomena can be explained by a theory of autoimmune attack which states that the autoimmune bodies attack its spinal cord in response to immune reaction.\n\n===Mechanism of myelitis===\nThe theory of autoimmune attack claims that a person with neuroimmunologic disorders have genetic predisposition to auto-immune disorder, and the environmental factors would trigger the disease. The specific genetics in myelitis is not completely understood. It is believed that the immune system response could be to viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection; however, it is not known why the immune system attacks itself. Especially, for the immune system to cause inflammatory response anywhere in the central nervous system, the cells from the immune system must pass through the [[blood brain barrier]]. In the case of myelitis, not only is the immune system dysfunctional, but the dysfunction also crosses this protective blood brain barrier to affect the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myelitis.org|title=Transverse Myelitis Association - Advocating for individuals with rare neuro-immune disorders|author=|date=|website=The Transverse Myelitis Association|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Infectious myelitis <ref name=\"pmid22927022\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mihai C, Jubelt B | title = Infectious myelitis | journal = Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 633\u201341 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22927022 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-012-0306-3}}</ref>===    \n\n[[Image:Polio spinal diagram-en.svg|thumb|The location of [[motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior horn cells]] of the [[spinal column]] will be affected by the polioviruses causing poliomyelitis.]]\n\n*[[Viral myelitis]]\nMost viral myelitis is acute, but the [[retrovirus]]es (such as HIV and HTLV) can cause chronic myelitis. [[Poliomyelitis]], or gray matter myelitis, is usually caused by infection of [[anterior horn of the spinal cord]] by the [[enterovirus]]es ([[poliovirus]]es, enteroviruses (EV) 70 and 71, [[echovirus]]es, [[coxsackievirus]]es A and B) and the [[flavivirus]]es (West Nile, [[Japanese encephalitis]], [[tick-borne encephalitis]]). On the other hand, [[transverse myelitis]] or [[leukomyelitis]], or [[white matter myelitis]], are often caused by the [[herpesvirus]]es and [[influenza virus]]. It can be due to direct viral invasion or via immune mediated mechanisms.\n\n*[[Bacterial myelitis]]\nBacterial myelitis includes ''[[Mycoplasma Pneumoniae]]'', which is a common agent for respiratory tract. Studies have shown respiratory tract infections within 4\u201339 days prior to the onset of transverse myelitis. Or, [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], and [[brucellosis]] are also known to cause myelitis in immune-compromised individuals. Myelitis is a rare manifestation of bacterial infection.\n\n*[[Fungal myelitis]]\n[[Fungi]] have been reported to cause spinal cord disease either by forming [[abscesses]] inside the bone or by [[granuloma]]. In general, there are two groups of fungi that may infect the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and cause myelitis - primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens include the following: ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', ''[[Blastomyces dermatitides]]'', and ''[[Hystoplasma capsulatum]]''. Secondary pathogens are opportunistic agents that primarily infect immunocompromised hosts such as [[Candida species]], [[Aspergillus]] species, and [[zygomycetes]].\n\n*[[Parasitic myelitis]]\nParasitic species infect human hosts through larvae that penetrate the skin. Then they enter the lymphatic and circulatory system, and migrate to liver and lung. Some reach the spinal cord. Parasitic infections have been reported with [[Schistosoma]] species, ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', [[Echinococcus]] species, ''[[Taenia solium]]'', ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', and [[Plasmodium]] species.\n\n===Autoimmune myelitis===\n\nIn 2016 it was identified in [[Mayo clinic]] an autoimmune form of myelitis due to the presence of anti-[[glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]] autoantibodies.

The type of onset (acute versus subacute/chronic) along with associated symptoms such as the presence of pain, constitutional symptoms that encompass fever, [[malaise]], weight loss or a cutaneous rash may help identify the cause of myelitis. In order to establish a diagnosis of myelitis, one has to localize the spinal cord level, and exclude cerebral and neuromuscular diseases. Also a detailed medical history, a careful neurologic examination, and imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed. In respect to the cause of the process, further work-up would help identify the cause and guide treatment.

Either way, aggressive rehabilitation and long-term symptom management are an integral part of the healthcare plan.\n\n===Prospective research direction===\nCentral nervous system nerve regeneration would be able to repair or regenerate the damage caused to the spinal cord. It would restore functions lost due to the disease.<ref>Karumbaiah, L., Bellamkonda, R.. ''Neural Tissue Engineering''.</ref>\n*Engineering endogenous repair\nCurrently, there exists a [[hydrogel]] based scaffold which acts as a channel to deliver nerve growth-enhancing substrates while providing structural support. These factors would promote nerve repairs to the target area. Hydrogels' macroporous properties would enable attachment of cells and enhance ion and nutrient exchange. In addition, hydrogels' biodegradability or bioresolvability would prevent the need for surgical removal of the hydrogel after drug delivery. It means that it would be dissolved naturally by the body's enzymatic reaction.\n*Biochemical repair\n:*Neurotropic factor therapy and gene therapy\n:*Neurotropic growth factors regulate growth, survival, and [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the [[axon]]. They benefit nerve regeneration after injury to the nervous system. They are a potent initiator of sensory axon growth and are up-regulated at the lesion site. The continuous delivery of [[neurotropic growth factor]] (NGF) would increase the nerve regeneration in the spinal cord. However, the excessive dosing of NGF often leads to undesired plasticity and sprouting of uninjured sensory nerves. Gene therapy would be able to increase the NGF efficacy by the controlled and sustained delivery in a site-specific manner.\n*[[Stem cell based therapies]]\nThe possibility for nerve regeneration after injury to the spinal cord was considered to be limited because of the absence of major [[neurogenesis]].

Camels are known to cause serious degradation of local environmental and cultural sites, particularly during dry conditions. An AU$19 million management program was funded in 2009, and, upon completion in 2013, the feral population was estimated to have been reduced to around 300,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Misery Coolgardie.jpg|thumb|A prospector riding a camel which held a world record for distance travelled without water (600 miles), 1895]] Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world. The first suggestion of importing camels into Australia was made in 1822 by Danish-French geographer and journalist [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], whose ''Universal Geography'' contains the following;\n\n<blockquote>For such an expedition, men of science and courage ought to be selected. They ought to be provided with all sorts of implements and stores, and with different animals, from the powers and instincts of which they may derive assistance. They should have oxen from Buenos Aires, or from the English settlements, mules from Senegal, and dromedaries from Africa or Arabia. The oxen would traverse the woods and the thickets; the mules would walk securely among rugged rocks and hilly countries; the dromedaries would cross the sandy deserts. Thus the expedition would be prepared for any kind of territory that the interior might present.

The cameleers also brought new commodities such as sugar, tea, tobacco, clothing and metal tools to remote Aboriginal groups. Aboriginal people incorporated camel hair into their traditional string artefacts, and provided information on desert waters and plant resources.

According to Kramer's biography, as the men travelled through the desert and encountered local people, they handed them boiled sweets, tea and sugar and played ''Jesus Loves Me'' on the gramophone.

Camels are known to cause serious degradation of local environmental and cultural sites, particularly during dry conditions. An AU$19 million management program was funded in 2009, and, upon completion in 2013, the feral population was estimated to have been reduced to around 300,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Misery Coolgardie.jpg|thumb|A prospector riding a camel which held a world record for distance travelled without water (600 miles), 1895]] Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world. The first suggestion of importing camels into Australia was made in 1822 by Danish-French geographer and journalist [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], whose ''Universal Geography'' contains the following;\n\n<blockquote>For such an expedition, men of science and courage ought to be selected. They ought to be provided with all sorts of implements and stores, and with different animals, from the powers and instincts of which they may derive assistance. They should have oxen from Buenos Aires, or from the English settlements, mules from Senegal, and dromedaries from Africa or Arabia. The oxen would traverse the woods and the thickets; the mules would walk securely among rugged rocks and hilly countries; the dromedaries would cross the sandy deserts. Thus the expedition would be prepared for any kind of territory that the interior might present. Dogs also should be taken to raise game, and to discover springs of water; and it has even been proposed to take pigs, for the sake of finding out esculent roots in the soil. When no kangaroos and game are to be found the party would subsist on the flesh of their own flocks. They should be provided with a balloon for spying at a distance any serious obstacle to their progress in particular directions, and for extending the range of observations which the eye would take of such level lands as are too wide to allow any heights beyond them to come within the compass of their view.<ref>Conrad Malte-Brun, ''Universal Geography: Containing the description of India and Oceanica'', Volume III 'containing the description of India and Oceanica', Book LVI 'Oceanica', Part IV 'New Holland and its dependancies', p. 568.

An exchange of skills, knowledge and goods soon developed. Some cameleers assisted Aboriginal people by carrying traditional exchange goods, including red ochre or the narcotic plant [[pituri]], along ancient trade routes such as the [[Birdsville Track]]. The cameleers also brought new commodities such as sugar, tea, tobacco, clothing and metal tools to remote Aboriginal groups. Aboriginal people incorporated camel hair into their traditional string artefacts, and provided information on desert waters and plant resources. Some cameleers employed Aboriginal men and women to assist them on their long desert treks.

The first of Kramer's trips was to the [[Musgrave Ranges]] and [[Mann Ranges]], and was sponsored by the Aborigines Friends Association, which sought a report on Indigenous living conditions. According to Kramer's biography, as the men travelled through the desert and encountered local people, they handed them boiled sweets, tea and sugar and played ''Jesus Loves Me'' on the gramophone. At night, using a \"magic lantern projector\", Kramer showed slides of [[Christmas]] and the life of Christ.

Degradation of the environment occurs when densities exceed two animals per square kilometre, which is presently the case throughout much of their range in the [[Northern Territory]] where they are confined to two main regions: the [[Simpson Desert]] and the western desert area of the [[Central Ranges]], [[Great Sandy Desert]] and [[Tanami Desert]].
