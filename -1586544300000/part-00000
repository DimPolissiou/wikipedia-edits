It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous best of year lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple best of decade lists. Some critics found that due to the nature of the album, reviewing it was difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous best of year lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple best of decade lists. Some critics found that due to the nature of the album, reviewing it was difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the [[public domain]]. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a [[fair use]].\nTraditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ |title=The Importance of Orphan Works Legislation}}</ref> Finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]s and collaborative content<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fair use and copyright protection: a price theory explanation |journal=International Review of Law and Economics|author=Ben Depoorter|author2= Francesco Parisi|doi=10.1016/S0144-8188(01)00071-0 |year=2002 |volume=21|issue=4|page=453|citeseerx = 10.1.1.196.423}}</ref>\n\n===Public domain===\n[[File:PD-icon.svg|thumb|100px|[[public domain]]]]\n{{Main article|Public domain}}\nThe public domain is a range of creative works whose [[copyright]] has expired or was never established; as well as ideas and facts<ref group=\" nb\">The copyright status of uncreative aggregates of basic data may differ by region, for the USA see ''[[Feist Publications v.

A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications.

Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any [[derivative work]]s be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained.\nA symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the [[copyright symbol]], facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right.

Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:Cc.logo.circle.svg|thumb|100px|[[Creative Commons]]]]\nIn media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all of the Creative Commons\u2019 licenses are entirely free: their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing.

The automatic protection provided by [[Berne Convention]] not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection.\nIt is also possible to \"inherit\" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories.

In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the [[public domain]]. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a [[fair use]].\nTraditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ |title=The Importance of Orphan Works Legislation}}</ref> Finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]s and collaborative content<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fair use and copyright protection: a price theory explanation |journal=International Review of Law and Economics|author=Ben Depoorter|author2= Francesco Parisi|doi=10.1016/S0144-8188(01)00071-0 |year=2002 |volume=21|issue=4|page=453|citeseerx = 10.1.1.196.423}}</ref>\n\n===Public domain===\n[[File:PD-icon.svg|thumb|100px|[[public domain]]]]\n{{Main article|Public domain}}\nThe public domain is a range of creative works whose [[copyright]] has expired or was never established; as well as ideas and facts<ref group=\" nb\">The copyright status of uncreative aggregates of basic data may differ by region, for the USA see ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'', for [[Australia]], see ''[[Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems]]''</ref> which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive licence may be referred to as \"[[copycenter]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/copycenter.html |title=Copycenter |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |authorlink=Eric S.

Authorship reconsidered?|author=Dusollier, S|series=Columbia Journal of Law and the Arts|year=2003|volume=26|issue=296}}</ref> The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author. Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any [[derivative work]]s be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained.\nA symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the [[copyright symbol]], facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=G.

Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.\n\n===Media===\n[[File:Cc.logo.circle.svg|thumb|100px|[[Creative Commons]]]]\nIn media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all of the Creative Commons\u2019 licenses are entirely free: their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are \"approved for free cultural works\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 |title=Approved for Free Cultural Works |accessdate=March 22, 2009| last=Linksvayer |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Linksvayer |date= February 20, 2008| publisher=[[Creative Commons]]}}</ref> [[Digital library|Repositories]] exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, [[clip art]], music,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |title=iRate Radio |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |publisher=[[SourceForge.net]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228222010/http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}</ref> and literature,.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F |title=Gutenberg:No Cost or Freedom? |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |date=April 23, 2007 |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}</ref>\nWhile extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the [[duplicate content]] problem.

The ease of dissemination has allowed for increased modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration.\nOpen source development models have been classified as having a similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentives that are typified by more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result from this incentive model decreasing production cost.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/staff/herkia/kava/Seminnarit/MI_mustonen.pdf |title=Copyleft \u2013 the economics of Linux and other open-source software |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |version=Discussion Paper No. 493 |last=Mustonen |first=Mikko |publisher=Department of Economics, [[University of Helsinki]] |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324205456/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/staff/herkia/kava/Seminnarit/MI_mustonen.pdf |archive-date=March 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nGiven sufficient interest in a software component, by using [[peer-to-peer]] distribution methods, distribution costs of software may be reduced, removing the burden of infrastructure maintenance from developers.

The automatic protection provided by [[Berne Convention]] not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection.\nIt is also possible to \"inherit\" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: [[LexML Brazil]], [[Legislation.gov.uk]], [[EUR-Lex#N-Lex|N-Lex of EU countries]]. In general, a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a [[government gazette]].

Simple sugars, also called [[monosaccharide]]s, include [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[galactose]]. Compound sugars, also called [[disaccharide]]s or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a [[glycosidic bond]]. Common examples are [[sucrose]] (glucose + fructose), [[lactose]] (glucose + galactose), and [[maltose]] (two molecules of glucose). In the body, compound sugars are [[hydrolysed]] into simple sugars. '''Table sugar''', '''granulated sugar''' or '''regular sugar''' refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.\n\nLonger chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars, and are called [[oligosaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s. Some other chemical substances, such as [[glycerol]] and [[sugar alcohol]]s, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar. \n\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. [[Honey]] and [[fruit]] are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in [[sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]], making them ideal for efficient commercial [[extract]]ion to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion [[tonne]]s. Maltose may be produced by [[malt]]ing grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in [[milk]], including human breast milk, and in some [[dairy product]]s. A cheap source of sugar is [[corn syrup]], industrially produced by converting corn [[starch]] into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\n[[File:Zuckerplastik zur Freiheitsidee 1880 Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|German sugar sculpture, 1880]]\n\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes [[Added sugar|added]] to commercially available [[processed food]] and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about {{convert|24|kg}} of sugar each year, or {{convert|33.1|kg|}} in [[Developed country|developed countries]], equivalent to over 260 [[food calorie]]s per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th&nbsp;century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to [[human health]]. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[dementia]], and [[tooth decay]]. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of [[free sugar]]s to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total [[Energy homeostasis|energy intake]].<ref name=\"WHO 2015p4\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] reflects the spread of the commodity.

Monosaccharides are also called \"simple sugars,\" the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to {{chem|C|n|H|2n|O|n}} with n between 3 and 7 ([[deoxyribose]] being an exception). [[Glucose]] has the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. The names of typical sugars end with -''ose'', as in \"[[glucose]]\" and \"[[fructose]]\". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of [[carbohydrates]] soluble in water. The [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] mono- and disaccharides contain either [[aldehyde]] groups or [[ketone]] groups. These [[carbonyl|carbon-oxygen]] double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by [[glycosidic bond]]s with the resultant loss of a molecule of water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) per bond.<ref name=Pigman>{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |author2=Horton, D. |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A |editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd |year=1972 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-12-556352-9 |pages=1\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[Monosaccharides]] in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as [[starch]]). [[Enzymes]] must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become [[metabolism|metabolized]]. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many [[pentose]]s and [[hexose]]s can form [[Heterocyclic compound|ring structures]]. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.<ref name=Pigman/>\n\n===Natural polymers===\n[[Biopolymer]]s of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose ({{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose ({{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}). Monosaccharides may be further converted into [[polysaccharides#structural polysaccharides|structural polysaccharides]] such as [[cellulose]] and [[pectin]] for [[cell wall]] construction or into energy reserves in the form of [[polysaccharides#storage polysaccharides|storage polysaccharides]] such as starch or [[inulin]]. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical [[potential energy|energy]] stored by [[cell (biology)|cells]], and can be converted to other types of energy.<ref name=Pigman/> Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though [[ruminant]]s can do so with the help of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in their gut.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01089198 |last1=Joshi |first1=S |last2=Agte |first2=V |title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands) |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201344 |year=1995 |pmid=8719737}}</ref> [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are built up of the monosaccharides [[deoxyribose]] and  [[ribose]], respectively.

Simple sugars, also called [[monosaccharide]]s, include [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[galactose]]. Compound sugars, also called [[disaccharide]]s or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a [[glycosidic bond]]. Common examples are [[sucrose]] (glucose + fructose), [[lactose]] (glucose + galactose), and [[maltose]] (two molecules of glucose). In the body, compound sugars are [[hydrolysed]] into simple sugars. '''Table sugar''', '''granulated sugar''' or '''regular sugar''' refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.\n\nLonger chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars, and are called [[oligosaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s. Some other chemical substances, such as [[glycerol]] and [[sugar alcohol]]s, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar. \n\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. [[Honey]] and [[fruit]] are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in [[sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]], making them ideal for efficient commercial [[extract]]ion to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion [[tonne]]s. Maltose may be produced by [[malt]]ing grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in [[milk]], including human breast milk, and in some [[dairy product]]s. A cheap source of sugar is [[corn syrup]], industrially produced by converting corn [[starch]] into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\n[[File:Zuckerplastik zur Freiheitsidee 1880 Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|German sugar sculpture, 1880]]\n\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes [[Added sugar|added]] to commercially available [[processed food]] and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about {{convert|24|kg}} of sugar each year, or {{convert|33.1|kg|}} in [[Developed country|developed countries]], equivalent to over 260 [[food calorie]]s per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th&nbsp;century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to [[human health]]. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[dementia]], and [[tooth decay]]. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of [[free sugar]]s to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total [[Energy homeostasis|energy intake]].<ref name=\"WHO 2015p4\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] reflects the spread of the commodity.

Monosaccharides are also called \"simple sugars,\" the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to {{chem|C|n|H|2n|O|n}} with n between 3 and 7 ([[deoxyribose]] being an exception). [[Glucose]] has the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. The names of typical sugars end with -''ose'', as in \"[[glucose]]\" and \"[[fructose]]\". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of [[carbohydrates]] soluble in water. The [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] mono- and disaccharides contain either [[aldehyde]] groups or [[ketone]] groups. These [[carbonyl|carbon-oxygen]] double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by [[glycosidic bond]]s with the resultant loss of a molecule of water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) per bond.<ref name=Pigman>{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |author2=Horton, D. |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A |editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd |year=1972 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-12-556352-9 |pages=1\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[Monosaccharides]] in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as [[starch]]). [[Enzymes]] must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become [[metabolism|metabolized]]. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many [[pentose]]s and [[hexose]]s can form [[Heterocyclic compound|ring structures]]. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.<ref name=Pigman/>\n\n===Natural polymers===\n[[Biopolymer]]s of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose ({{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose ({{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}). Monosaccharides may be further converted into [[polysaccharides#structural polysaccharides|structural polysaccharides]] such as [[cellulose]] and [[pectin]] for [[cell wall]] construction or into energy reserves in the form of [[polysaccharides#storage polysaccharides|storage polysaccharides]] such as starch or [[inulin]]. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical [[potential energy|energy]] stored by [[cell (biology)|cells]], and can be converted to other types of energy.<ref name=Pigman/> Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though [[ruminant]]s can do so with the help of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in their gut.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01089198 |last1=Joshi |first1=S |last2=Agte |first2=V |title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands) |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201344 |year=1995 |pmid=8719737}}</ref> [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are built up of the monosaccharides [[deoxyribose]] and  [[ribose]], respectively.

The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a [[carbonatation]] or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular [[activated carbon]] or an [[ion-exchange resin]]. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out.

If the [[must]] formed by pressing the fruit has a low sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called [[chaptalization]].
