A cluster of four skyscrapers, the tallest of which became Manchester's tallest building and the 5th tallest building in the United Kingdom in November 2018 at 65 floors & 201 metres.]]\n[[File:Granada Studios Building and Beetham Tower in Manchester.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]]. The second tallest building in Greater Manchester and the second tallest outside London at 169 metres completed in 2006.]]\n\nThis '''list of the tallest buildings and structures in Greater Manchester''' ranks buildings in the ten boroughs of [[Greater Manchester Urban Area|Greater Manchester]] (including [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]]) by height.\n\nGreater Manchester currently has ten towers completed at a height of 100 metres or more and a further five towers above 100 metres under construction. This is by far the highest number of high rises in any metropolitan area in the United Kingdom outside [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London|Greater London]].\n\nThe first proposed skyscraper in [[Manchester City Centre|Central Manchester]] was the 110 metre (361&nbsp;ft) [[Quay Street|Quay Street Tower]]. Envisioned to be completed in 1948 it would have been the tallest tower in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1200|title=Quay Street Tower, Manchester - Building #1200|website=www.skyscrapernews.com}}</ref> The proposal was rejected and said to be inconsiderate, as much of the city was still rebuilding after the [[Manchester Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe first tall building boom in Greater Manchester occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with notable buildings including the 123 metre (404&nbsp;ft) [[City Tower, Manchester|City Tower]] which became the tallest building in the United Kingdom when constructed and the 118 metre (387&nbsp;ft) [[CIS Tower]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s few significant proposals came to fruition. However, there has been a renewed interest in skyscrapers in Manchester in the 21st century with a number of proposals being brought forward. In 2006, the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom outside London and the first to reach a height of over 150 metres making it also the first official [[skyscraper]] outside London. In 2018, [[Deansgate Square|Deansgate Square South Tower]] became the only skyscraper in the United Kingdom outside London to reach a height of over 200 metres. [[Trinity Islands, Manchester|Trinity Tower X]], estimated for completion in 2024 is due to become Greater Manchester's tallest building at 213 metres.\n\nUnlike most major cities in the United Kingdom, there are no height restrictions and local planning officers generally adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises in Manchester. If all future proposals come to fruition, Greater Manchester could contain well over 250 buildings over 50 metres tall as well as 41 high rises above 100 metres and 11 skyscrapers above 150 metres, with two higher than 200 metres.\n\nCentral Manchester is the predominant location for tall proposals with 31 buildings over 100 metres either built, under construction or proposed, with a further 5 proposals earmarked for [[Salford Quays]], three miles west of Central Manchester.\n\nCastlefield (14), which contains the Trinity Islands and Deansgate Square skyscraper developments, and Greengate (8) are the two areas with the biggest collection of skyscrapers in Manchester either built, under construction or proposed over 100 metres tall. Both areas are part of wider masterplans to expand Central Manchester out southwards and westwards respectively with amenities such as new green areas and schools to enable urban living.\n\nHowever these areas are not the only new areas of Central Manchester undergoing significant development. The northern side of the city contains a number of office and residential developments either completed or currently under construction as part of the \u00a3800 million NOMA development. Significant completed projects within NOMA already delivered including the iconic [[One Angel Square]], a modern [[Zero-energy building|zero carbon emissions]] [[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus building]] and the 108 metre [[Angel Gardens]] residential tower. These buildings will be joined by the Angel Meadow development which will deliver three new residential towers including the 128 metre Angel Meadow Park and Angel Square office towers as well as the Victoria Residence development which will also deliver three new residential towers, the tallest of which will reach 111 metres.\n\nThe southern side of Central Manchester is being expanded into the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock|Chorlton-On-Medlock]] inner city suburb by the Circle Square development which will deliver a mix of office and residential towers as well as new green spaces. In 2020 1 Circle Square residential tower became the first tower to complete in the scheme with a number due to follow including the 116 metre Affinity Living Circle Square residential tower.  \n\nAside from the above developments, the biggest new future developments areas of Central Manchester through the 2020s will be the new area of [[St John's, Manchester|St John's]] in the western side of Central Manchester adjacent to [[Spinningfields]] and the \u00a31.2 billion Mayfield scheme around [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly station]] in the east side of Central Manchester. St John's will deliver new cultural, office and residential developments including The Factory, a new inner city theatre, a 108 metre Vita tower and the 101 metre Union Living office tower. \n\nOver the next 10 years the Mayfield masterplan will play a key role in further expanding Central Manchester out eastwards, delivering a large new central park area among a large number of new office and residential towers with a number expected to be over 150 metres in height. Initial proposals for Mayfield to go to planning approval are expected in 2020 with the 22 storey office development in Baring Street among the first.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Tallest buildings and structures==\nThis list ranks externally complete buildings and free-standing structures in Greater Manchester that stand at least {{convert|50|m|ft|0}}, based on standard height measurement.

A cluster of four skyscrapers, the tallest of which became Manchester's tallest building and the 5th tallest building in the United Kingdom in November 2018 at 65 floors & 201 metres.]]\n[[File:Granada Studios Building and Beetham Tower in Manchester.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]]. The second tallest building in Greater Manchester and the second tallest outside London at 169 metres completed in 2006.]]\n\nThis '''list of the tallest buildings and structures in Greater Manchester''' ranks buildings in the ten boroughs of [[Greater Manchester Urban Area|Greater Manchester]] (including [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]]) by height.\n\nGreater Manchester currently has ten towers completed at a height of 100 metres or more and a further five towers above 100 metres under construction. This is by far the highest number of high rises in any metropolitan area in the United Kingdom outside [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London|Greater London]].\n\nThe first proposed skyscraper in [[Manchester City Centre|Central Manchester]] was the 110 metre (361&nbsp;ft) [[Quay Street|Quay Street Tower]]. Envisioned to be completed in 1948 it would have been the tallest tower in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1200|title=Quay Street Tower, Manchester - Building #1200|website=www.skyscrapernews.com}}</ref> The proposal was rejected and said to be inconsiderate, as much of the city was still rebuilding after the [[Manchester Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe first tall building boom in Greater Manchester occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with notable buildings including the 123 metre (404&nbsp;ft) [[City Tower, Manchester|City Tower]] which became the tallest building in the United Kingdom when constructed and the 118 metre (387&nbsp;ft) [[CIS Tower]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s few significant proposals came to fruition. However, there has been a renewed interest in skyscrapers in Manchester in the 21st century with a number of proposals being brought forward. In 2006, the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom outside London and the first to reach a height of over 150 metres making it also the first official [[skyscraper]] outside London. In 2018, [[Deansgate Square|Deansgate Square South Tower]] became the only skyscraper in the United Kingdom outside London to reach a height of over 200 metres. [[Trinity Islands, Manchester|Trinity Tower X]], estimated for completion in 2024 is due to become Greater Manchester's tallest building at 213 metres.\n\nUnlike most major cities in the United Kingdom, there are no height restrictions and local planning officers generally adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises in Manchester. If all future proposals come to fruition, Greater Manchester could contain well over 250 buildings over 50 metres tall as well as 41 high rises above 100 metres and 11 skyscrapers above 150 metres, with two higher than 200 metres.\n\nCentral Manchester is the predominant location for tall proposals with 31 buildings over 100 metres either built, under construction or proposed, with a further 5 proposals earmarked for [[Salford Quays]], three miles west of Central Manchester.\n\nCastlefield (14), which contains the Trinity Islands and Deansgate Square skyscraper developments, and Greengate (8) are the two areas with the biggest collection of skyscrapers in Manchester either built, under construction or proposed over 100 metres tall. Both areas are part of wider masterplans to expand Central Manchester out southwards and westwards respectively with amenities such as new green areas and schools to enable urban living.\n\nHowever these areas are not the only new areas of Central Manchester undergoing significant development. The northern side of the city contains a number of office and residential developments either completed or currently under construction as part of the \u00a3800 million NOMA development. Significant completed projects within NOMA already delivered including the iconic [[One Angel Square]], a modern [[Zero-energy building|zero carbon emissions]] [[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus building]] and the 108 metre [[Angel Gardens]] residential tower. These buildings will be joined by the Angel Meadow development which will deliver three new residential towers including the 128 metre Angel Meadow Park and Angel Square office towers as well as the Victoria Residence development which will also deliver three new residential towers, the tallest of which will reach 111 metres.\n\nThe southern side of Central Manchester is being expanded into the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock|Chorlton-On-Medlock]] inner city suburb by the Circle Square development which will deliver a mix of office and residential towers as well as new green spaces. In 2020 1 Circle Square residential tower became the first tower to complete in the scheme with a number due to follow including the 116 metre Affinity Living Circle Square residential tower.  \n\nAside from the above developments, the biggest new future developments areas of Central Manchester through the 2020s will be the new area of [[St John's, Manchester|St John's]] in the western side of Central Manchester adjacent to [[Spinningfields]] and the \u00a31.2 billion Mayfield scheme around [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly station]] in the east side of Central Manchester. St John's will deliver new cultural, office and residential developments including The Factory, a new inner city theatre, a 108 metre Vita tower and the 101 metre Union Living office tower. \n\nOver the next 10 years the Mayfield masterplan will play a key role in further expanding Central Manchester out eastwards, delivering a large new central park area among a large number of new office and residential towers with a number expected to be over 150 metres in height. Initial proposals for Mayfield to go to planning approval are expected in 2020 with the 22 storey office development in Baring Street among the first.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Tallest buildings and structures==\nThis list ranks externally complete buildings and free-standing structures in Greater Manchester that stand at least {{convert|50|m|ft|0}}, based on standard height measurement.

86.14% from [[GameRankings]], and 87/100 from [[Metacritic]].<ref name=gr/><ref name=mc/> On release, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the PS2 version of the game a 33 out of 40.<ref name=fa/> The game received the maximum score from ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'',<ref name=ce/> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]],<ref name=g4/> and ''Gaming Age''.<ref name=ga/>\n\nJeremy Dunham of [[IGN]], GameZone's Michael Knutson and [[1UP.com]] staff praised the multitude of moves;<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=1up/> Knutson, however, said that it was difficult performing special moves,<ref name=zone/> and 1UP.com affirmed \"The real improvement, though, is the addition of more life-destroying options, like the hyper-addictive Challenge mode.\"<ref name=1up/> Dunham accuse the fighting engine of being \"too advanced for the casual fighting fan\", also criticizing its \"sucker\" control scheme.<ref name=ign/> Conversely, ''[[GamePro]]'' thought it \"can be enjoyed by novices and veterans alike\",<ref name=pro/> and Matt Keil of G4 said it \"is surprisingly accessible\" to all gamers.<ref name=g4/> Dunham cited how the \"two-player mode allows for near-infinite possibilities and all the extra options are just icing on the cake.\"<ref name=ign/> In contrast Kasavin criticized the other modes for not being as engaging as the two-player mode.<ref name=spot/>\n\nDunham stated it has \"incredibly attractive backgrounds, super slick animations, and the best character design on PlayStation 2.\"<ref name=ign/> An ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' (''EGM'') reviewer stated it has \"cooler character designs on a PS2 fighter\" whilst another said, \"some of the coolest 2D game artwork ever.\"<ref name=egm/> ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' deemed it as \"the

Knutson, Keil, and ''GamePro'' commended its similarity with [[Japanese animated series]].<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/><ref name=pro/> The reviewer for ''GamePro'' stated it \"becomes an art form in its own right.\"<ref name=pro/> [[Greg Kasavin]] of [[GameSpot]], however, said \"many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely that it can be difficult to see exactly what's going on.\"<ref name=spot/>\n\nKasavin commented that its \"cohesive musical style ... further helps set this game apart.\"<ref name=spot/> Dunham deemed it as having \"One of the best soundtracks to come along for quite some time\", and praised Sammy for keeping the original voice actors,<ref name=ign/> as did Knutson, which felt it \"gives it a 'cooler aura'.\"<ref name=zone/> Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be \"excellent\" and \"really great\" respectively.<ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/> On the other hand, ''GamePro'' described the sound design as the game's \"major flaw.\"<ref

its [[replay value]],<ref name=zone/> and variety of features.<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/><ref name=egm/> Dunham even declared it \"reads like the bible of fighting game options. Taking a page from every other title out there, there doesn't seem to be a single feature on the horizon that's been left out of ''GGX2'' for fear of the Completists.\"<ref name=ign/> In spite of the praise, other criticisms vary from its general difficulty<ref name=ga/><ref name=ce/><ref name=zone/> to the lack of an online play mode,<ref name=spot/><ref name=now/> position of move list in training mode,<ref name=rev/> and the difficulty to perform moves in [[Dual Shock]].<ref name=spy/>\n\nD.

86.14% from [[GameRankings]], and 87/100 from [[Metacritic]].<ref name=gr/><ref name=mc/> On release, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the PS2 version of the game a 33 out of 40.<ref name=fa/> The game received the maximum score from ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'',<ref name=ce/> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]],<ref name=g4/> and ''Gaming Age''.<ref name=ga/>\n\nJeremy Dunham of [[IGN]], GameZone's Michael Knutson and [[1UP.com]] staff praised the multitude of moves;<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=1up/> Knutson, however, said that it was difficult performing special moves,<ref name=zone/> and 1UP.com affirmed \"The real improvement, though, is the addition of more life-destroying options, like the hyper-addictive Challenge mode.\"<ref name=1up/> Dunham accuse the fighting engine of being \"too advanced for the casual fighting fan\", also criticizing its \"sucker\" control scheme.<ref name=ign/> Conversely, ''[[GamePro]]'' thought it \"can be enjoyed by novices and veterans alike\",<ref name=pro/> and Matt Keil of G4 said it \"is surprisingly accessible\" to all gamers.<ref name=g4/> Dunham cited how the \"two-player mode allows for near-infinite possibilities and all the extra options are just icing on the cake.\"<ref name=ign/> In contrast Kasavin criticized the other modes for not being as engaging as the two-player mode.<ref name=spot/>\n\nDunham stated it has \"incredibly attractive backgrounds, super slick animations, and the best character design on PlayStation 2.\"<ref name=ign/> An ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' (''EGM'') reviewer stated it has \"cooler character designs on a PS2 fighter\" whilst another said, \"some of the coolest 2D game artwork ever.\"<ref name=egm/> ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' deemed it as \"the best-looking 2D graphics ever seen in a fighter.\"<ref name=opm/> 1UP.com said, \"the ultrasharp, hi-res character art and fluid animation keep ''XX'' at the cutting 2D edge.\"<ref name=1up/> Dunham, Knutson, Keil, and ''GamePro'' commended its similarity with [[Japanese animated series]].<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/><ref name=pro/> The reviewer for ''GamePro'' stated it \"becomes an art form in its own right.\"<ref name=pro/> [[Greg Kasavin]] of [[GameSpot]], however, said \"many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely that it can be difficult to see exactly what's going on.\"<ref name=spot/>\n\nKasavin commented that its \"cohesive musical style ... further helps set this game apart.\"<ref name=spot/> Dunham deemed it as having \"One of the best soundtracks to come along for quite some time\", and praised Sammy for keeping the original voice actors,<ref name=ign/> as did Knutson, which felt it \"gives it a 'cooler aura'.\"<ref name=zone/> Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be \"excellent\" and \"really great\" respectively.<ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/> On the other hand, ''GamePro'' described the sound design as the game's \"major flaw.\"<ref name=pro/> ''EGM'' remarked \"Depending on your tastes, ''GGX2''{{'}}s pervasive heavy-metal cheesiness might negatively influence your opinion of the game.\"<ref name=egm/>\n\nOther features praised include its short loading time,<ref name=spot/><ref name=spy/> the variety of game modes<ref name=spot/><ref name=spy/><ref name=ga/><ref name=rev/><ref name=egm/> and characters,<ref name=spy/><ref name=ign/><ref name=g4/> the [[Balance (game design)|balance]] between characters' abilities,<ref name=spot/><ref name=ce/><ref name=rev/> the response of the controls,<ref name=spot/><ref name=zone/> its [[replay value]],<ref name=zone/> and variety of features.<ref name=ign/><ref name=zone/><ref name=g4/><ref name=egm/> Dunham even declared it \"reads like the bible of fighting game options. Taking a page from every other title out there, there doesn't seem to be a single feature on the horizon that's been left out of ''GGX2'' for fear of the Completists.\"<ref name=ign/> In spite of the praise, other criticisms vary from its general difficulty<ref name=ga/><ref name=ce/><ref name=zone/> to the lack of an online play mode,<ref name=spot/><ref name=now/> position of move list in training mode,<ref name=rev/> and the difficulty to perform moves in [[Dual Shock]].<ref name=spy/>\n\nD.

The team is a member of the [[ECHL]]. Originally established in 1990, the team first played their games in the [[Cincinnati Gardens]] and now play at [[Heritage Bank Center]]. The Cyclones are a minor league affiliate of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] ([[National Hockey League]]) and the [[Rochester Americans]] ([[American Hockey League]]).\n\nCincinnati has fielded Cyclones teams with three separate franchises in two different leagues: the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] (1992\u20132001) and the ECHL (1990\u20131992, 2001\u20132004, 2006\u2013present). Together, the franchises have combined to win two [[Kelly Cup]]s (2008 and 2010), three conference championships (2008, 2010 and 2014), two overall points championships (2008 and 2019), and five division championships (1996, 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2019). In 2007\u201308, the team had the most successful season in ECHL history with 55 wins, 115 points, and its first conference and league championships.\n\n==History==\nThere have been three separate [[Professional sports league organization|franchises]] known as the Cincinnati Cyclones, two in the [[ECHL]] and one in the IHL.\n\n===The early ECHL years: 1990\u20131992===\nThe first franchise to use the name Cincinnati Cyclones was founded in [[1990\u201391 ECHL season|1990]]. The team played their games at the [[Cincinnati Gardens]]. They lost in the first round of the playoffs in the 1990\u201391 season. In the [[1991\u201392 ECHL season|1991\u201392 season]], the Cyclones lost in the Riley Cup semifinals. The team's owner at the time, [[Doug Kirchhofer]], was granted an [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] franchise and chose to move the Cyclones name to that franchise. He then sold the ECHL franchise to Art Clarkson of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to form the new [[Birmingham Bulls (ECHL)|Birmingham Bulls]].\n\n===The IHL years: 1992\u20132001===\nThe first season in the IHL, Cincinnati failed to qualify for the postseason, which would be the first of only two seasons in which they did not qualify. [[Paul Lawless]], who would eventually be head coach and vice president of player development and have his number retired, began his first of several stints with the team in the [[1992\u201393 IHL season|1992\u201393 season]]. On April 2, 2004, during his number retirement ceremony, he was singled out as a reason for the team's success, both on the ice and in attendance. During the IHL years, the Cyclones set a team record of eight consecutive 90+ point seasons,<ref>{{citeweb| url = http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/display_standings.php?tmi=5255 | title = Cincinnati Cyclones season standings | website = hockeydb.com | date = 2012-03-04 | accessdate = 2012-03-04}}</ref> ending when the International Hockey League ceased operations in 2001. During the Cyclones nine years in the IHL, they won their only division and conference regular season championships in the [[1995\u201396 IHL season|1995\u201396 season]], but lost in a seven-game semifinal series to the [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]].\n\nIn 1997, the Cyclones' lease agreement with the Cincinnati Gardens came to an end when the two sides were unable to reach an agreement for a new contract. Team owner, Doug Kirchhofer, purchased what then was known as Riverfront Coliseum in downtown Cincinnati, renamed it The Crown and renovated the arena. During the seven seasons the Cyclones were in the arena, the venue was renamed the Firstar Center and now is known as [[Heritage Bank Center]]. The team has since been unsuccessful in reclaiming the higher attendance numbers from the Cincinnati Gardens, until the 2008 Kelly Cup, where they drew 12,722 fans to the last game of the postseason.<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://echl.leaguestat.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=5345 | title = Cyclones reclaim success from past | publisher = [[ECHL]] | date = 2005-04-05 | accessdate = 2005-04-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607192827/http://echl.leaguestat.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=5345 | archive-date = 2008-06-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Return to the ECHL: 2001\u20132004===\nThe third Cyclones franchise started in the [[1995\u201396 ECHL season|1995]] as the [[Louisville RiverFrogs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. After three years, the team moved to [[Miami]] as the [[Miami Matadors]]. After the [[1998\u201399 ECHL season|lone season]] in Florida, the franchise eventually came into the ownership of a group in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and the franchise went into inactive status while ownership looked into locations for their team. Upon the folding of the IHL, the Cyclones name was sold to this ownership group who moved the franchise to Cincinnati to become the new Cyclones.\n\nThe first year back in the ECHL ended the team's streak of 90+ point seasons with the Cyclones finishing just 12 points shy despite a 10-game fewer season length. Former Cyclones player [[Paul Lawless]] became head coach, as a mid-season replacement for Ray Edwards.\n\nBefore the start of the [[2003\u201304 ECHL season|2003\u201304 season]] former Cyclones player and assistant coach [[Chris Cichocki]] left the [[Arkansas RiverBlades]] in order to return as the Cyclones head coach. Despite his success with Arkansas, Cichocki led the team to their worst season with 54 points and failed to make the playoffs for the second time in team history.\n\nShortly after ending the season without a playoff berth, in April 2004, the Cyclones suspended operations. This suspension was mainly due to lack of revenue and safe access to the arena as it was limited by construction in Downtown Cincinnati. This dormancy left Cincinnati hockey to the cross-town, Cincinnati Gardens-based [[American Hockey League|AHL]] rival, [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] and stopped the city's record of two minor league hockey teams in the same city for consecutive years. The Cincinnati Mighty Ducks suspended operations in 2005 after their NHL affiliate, the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], switched their affiliation to the [[Portland Pirates]].\n\n===Resumed play: 2006\u2013present===\nWith minor league hockey dormant in Cincinnati for a year, and plans for the proposed AHL Cincinnati RailRaiders franchise scrapped for [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307]], on April 21, 2006, the Cyclones announced that they would participate in the upcoming [[2006\u201307 ECHL season]]. They returned to play their home games at U.S. Bank Arena, joining their two ECHL, [[Ohio]] rivals, the [[Dayton Bombers]] and [[Toledo Storm]]. They then obtained an affiliation with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]. The Cyclones won their first game back in the ECHL on October 20 against the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]] at U.S. Bank Arena with a score of 3 to 1. Head coach [[Chuck Weber (ice hockey)|Chuck Weber]] was the runner-up for the ECHL's Coach of the Year award for 2006\u201307<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://www.cycloneshockey.com/news_data.php?article=00264 | title = Weber finishes second in Coach of Year voting | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2008-04-01 | accessdate = 2012-03-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614063159/http://www.cycloneshockey.com/news_data.php?article=00264 | archivedate = 2008-06-14 }}</ref> and was re-signed for the [[2007\u201308 ECHL season|2007\u201308 season]].\n\nIn addition to the Montreal/Hamilton affiliation, the Cyclones added the NHL's [[Nashville Predators]] and the AHL's [[Milwaukee Admirals]] as affiliates in 2007. The Cyclones' 2007\u201308 season saw the club break numerous franchise and league records. Through 50 games, the Cyclones were 31 games over .500. Attendance at games had increased nearly 40% over 2006\u201307 and the club had already surpassed their win total from 2006\u201307 (37).

Individually, Chuck Weber was named ECHL coach of the year, earning him the John Brophy trophy. David Desharnais claimed three ECHL awards: Most Valuable Player, Rookie of the Year, and the Leading Scorer award with 29 goals and 77 assists for 106 points. In addition, Chad Starling won the award for the highest [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|plus/minus]] rating.\n\nThe Cyclones entered the playoffs and defeated the [[Johnstown Chiefs]] four games to none. The Cyclones moved on to take on the [[Reading Royals]], Cincinnati took the series in seven games to claim their second ever North Division playoff title. The Cyclones then defeated the [[South Carolina Stingrays]], 2\u20131 in overtime, to claim the American Conference Championship in five games.  With their victory, Cincinnati also claimed the E.A. \"Bud\" Gingher Memorial Trophy.\n\nThe Cyclones then defeated the National Conference Champion [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] in the Kelly Cup Finals, clinching their first championship in team history in six games. After splitting the first two games in Cincinnati (Cincinnati 4\u20133 and Las Vegas 1\u20130), the series shifted to Las Vegas, where Cincinnati won games three and five to take a 3\u20132 series lead. In front of a record setting crowd, 12,722 fans, at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati on June 5, the Cyclones defeated Las Vegas in game six, 3\u20131, to take the championship and their 71st win of the season. Goalie Cedrick Desjardins was named the Kelly Cup Playoff MVP.\n\nAfter the Cyclones cup win [[Coach (ice hockey)|coach]] Chuck Weber and [[assistant coach]] Dean Stork received multi-year extensions. Weber was also given the title of vice president. On November 29, Weber picked up his 100th professional head coaching victory with a 6\u20133 win at [[Johnstown Chiefs|Johnstown]].\n\nCincinnati's [[2008\u201309 ECHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was not as successful as the previous one, but they won 41 games for 87 points, repeating as North Division champions. They won a seven-game series against the [[Wheeling Nailers]], including a double overtime game seven win, and swept the [[Elmira Jackals]] to win the North Division playoff title. However, the Cyclones would be swept by the South Carolina Stingrays in the American Conference Finals.\n\nThe [[2009\u201310 ECHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be more successful with 44 wins and 91 points, the wins total being the most in the American Conference. Despite that, the Cyclones finished second in the North Division to the [[Kalamazoo Wings]] and fifth in the conference. This led to a rematch with fourth seeded, and defending champion, South Carolina in the first round, where Cincinnati defeated the Stingrays in five games. Veteran captain Barrett Eghotz scored in overtime for the 3\u20132 win in game five and was the third straight overtime game in the series. The Cyclones then faced the top seeded [[Charlotte Checkers (ECHL)|Charlotte Checkers]], defeating the Checkers in game seven with a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nCincinnati drew the [[Reading Royals]] in the American Conference Final. The seven game series was marred by several incidents, both on and off the ice, that resulted in suspensions and fines to players and staff of both organizations. The worst occurred after game six, when Reading's [[Scott Fletcher (ice hockey)|Scott Fletcher]] allegedly struck a Cincinnati fan with a stick, drawing an indefinite suspension by the league.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Nevertheless, the series made ECHL history when, after losing the first two at home, then game three at Reading, Cincinnati posted wins of 6\u20134, 5\u20130 and 6\u20133 to force the team's third winner-take-all game in the 2010 playoffs. In front of 5,340 fans, the Cyclones posted a 1\u20130 win to become the first team in ECHL history, and the sixth professional hockey team in history,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} to come back from a 3\u20130 deficit to win a best of seven series. The only goal of the contest was scored by [[Barret Ehgoetz]] 13:48 into the game.\n\nThe Cyclones defeated the [[Idaho Steelheads]] in the [[2010 Kelly Cup playoffs|2010 Kelly Cup Final]], four-games-to-one. Cincinnati scored game-winning goals within the last minute in the first two games, a 3\u20132 win on a goal by Mark Van Guilder with 49.2 seconds remaining on May 14, and a 1\u20130 win the next night, when Mathieu Aubin netted the only goal in the contest and only with 20.1 seconds remaining in regulation. The series shifted to US Bank Arena and witnessed an Idaho victory within the first minute of the second overtime of game three, as Evan Barlow received a pass at the bottom of the right circle and fired the puck into a largely vacated goal, as Cyclones goalie Robert Mayer had committed to the left side.\n\nIn front of yet another ECHL playoff record setting crowd of 13,483 at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati, the Cyclones defeated Idaho in game five, 2\u20131, to take the championship. With the victory, the Cyclones clinched their second Kelly Cup title in three years. The game was also the Cyclones 24th Kelly Cup playoff game, surpassing the club record of 22 postseason games played by the 2008 championship team and is one more than South Carolina (23) had in its title run in 2009. Rookie Cyclones goaltenders Robert Mayer and Jeremy Smith were named co-winners of the Kelly Cup playoffs MVP. Cincinnati finished with a total record of 59\u201332\u20134.\n\nThe Cyclones underwent several changes before the [[2010\u201311 ECHL season|2010\u201311 season]] when assistant coach Dean Stork became the head coach of the [[Greenville Road Warriors]] in June and head coach Chuck Weber was promoted to the [[American Hockey League]] as head coach of the [[Rochester Americans]] on July 27. On August 4, Cincinnati signed a new affiliation agreement with the NHL's [[Florida Panthers]], who used Rochester as their AHL farm team, creating a working relationship between Chuck Weber and his former Cyclones team. On August 12, Cincinnati named [[Jarrod Skalde]] as the new head coach. After undergoing this major coaching overhaul and losing a large portion of their roster, the Cyclones went on to post their third lowest points total in franchise history. They were still able to earn a seventh seed in the ECHL playoffs, but lost in the first round to Reading Royals, three-games-to-one.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida Panthers moved their AHL affiliation to the [[San Antonio Rampage]] as well their AHL head coach, Chuck Weber.. Despite heavy support by new AHL affiliate, the [[2011\u201312 ECHL season|2011\u201312 season]] would still be unsuccessful. The Cyclones had a slow start to the season and while they stayed competitive throughout the rest of the season, they earned only 35 wins and 79 points. Cincinnati would finish tenth in the conference, marking only the third time in their 20-season history that they did not make the playoffs.\n\nThe Cyclones made a complete turnaround the next season, beginning the season unbeaten in regulation for the first nine games. Their 42 wins and 92 points won the North Division regular season championship, their third such accolade in six seasons, and placed them second in the Eastern Conference. The season earned head coach Jarrod Skalde Coach of the Year honors. Cincinnati would go on to win a pair of six-game wins against the [[Toledo Walleye]] and [[Gwinnett Gladiators]] before losing a five-game conference final to the top seeded Reading Royals, who would go on to win the Kelly Cup.\n\nOn July 9, 2013, coach Skalde accepted an assistant's position with the AHL's [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]], becoming the second consecutive Cyclones coach to be promoted to a higher level. Before the 2014\u201315 season, Skalde was appointed as Norfolk's head coach.\n\n[[Image:CincinnatiCyclones33013.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Cincinnati Cyclones vs. Evansville IceMen on March 30, 2013]]\nCincinnati came back strong under new head coach [[Ben Simon]] in 2013\u201314, with 41 wins and 91 points for a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Cincinnati would win three series against the [[Orlando Solar Bears (ECHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]], [[Fort Wayne Komets]], and [[Greenville Road Warriors]], all in six games, earning their third trip to the Kelly Cup Finals. They faced the Brabham Cup winning [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]], but would lose the series in six games. Despite the loss in the final, Cincinnati goaltender [[Rob Madore]] was named Most Valuable Player of the [[2014 Kelly Cup playoffs]], becoming the first player from the losing team to win the award in the ECHL's 26-year history, and the fourth Cincinnati goaltender to either win the trophy outright or share the trophy. Madore earned the award after leading the ECHL with all 14 of Cincinnati's playoff wins, 1,493 minutes of play, and a Cincinnati record 756 saves while playing every second of Cincinnati's 24 playoff games.\n\nAfter the season, coach Simon accepted a role with the [[Toronto Marlies]], the top affiliate of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Simon became the third consecutive Cyclones head coach to accept a role in the AHL. Following Simon's promotion, Matt Macdonald became Cincinnati's head coach. In the [[2014\u201315 ECHL season|2014\u201315 season]], Cincinnati finished fifth in the North Division of the Eastern Conference with a record of 31\u201330\u20132\u20139. The team would miss the playoffs by only three points.\n\nOn February 27, 2016, the Cyclones played in front of their first-ever sellout at US Bank Arena with 16,529 fans were in attendance for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] Night and one dollar pizza slices. While the game was a 3\u20132 shootout loss to the [[Indy Fuel]], the Cyclones set the record for the largest crowd for a professional hockey game in the 41-year history of US Bank Arena.<ref>{{citeweb| url = http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2016/02/cyclones-announce-sellout-for-weekend-finale | title = Cyclones announce sellout for weekend finale | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2016-04-02 | accessdate = 2016-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb| url = http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2016/02/recap-cyclones-drop-shootout-thriller-in-front-of-record-crowd | title = Cyclones drop shootout thriller in front of record crowd | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2016-02-27 | accessdate = 2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\nAfter ten seasons, the Nashville Predators and Milwaukee Admirals ended their affiliation with the Cyclones prior to the [[2017\u201318 ECHL season|2017\u201318 season]]. The Cyclones then found affiliations with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Rochester Americans]]. This is the second time Buffalo has affiliated with a Cincinnati hockey team, after the Sabres' affiliation with the [[Cincinnati Swords]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2017/05/cyclones-agree-on-affiliation-with-buffalo-sabres |title=CYCLONES AGREE ON AFFILIATION WITH BUFFALO SABRES |publisher=Cyclones |date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2018\u201319 ECHL season|2018\u201319 season]], head coach Matt Mcdonald was hired as an assistant with the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] in the AHL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fox19.com/story/38558290/cyclones-head-coach-leaving-cincinnati/ |title=Cyclones head coach leaving Cincinnati |work=Fox19 |date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Matt Thomas (ice hockey)|Matt Thomas]], who then led the team to the regular season title and second [[Brabham Cup]] in franchise history and won the [[John Brophy Award]] for coach of the year. Despite the regular season success, the team lost in the division finals four games to one to the [[Toledo Walleye]].\n\n==Uniform==\nAfter introducing their current mascot, Twister, in 1995, the Cyclones had always included him in their uniform design. In fact, from 1996\u20132014 he was the centerpiece of the jerseys they wore. However, prior to the 2014\u201315 season, the organization did a complete revamp of the uniforms and their colors. Twister was removed from the uniform completely along with the color yellow. The shade of red used was also changed from a darker maroonish style red to a more bright royal red. The logo now is described as being a twister, or cyclone, in the center of a \"C\" standing for, Cincinnati. The jersey concepts also changed from being a classic hockey style to a more modern era look. The home, away, and alternate jerseys have red shoulders and red stripes that begin at the elbow area and wrap around to the underside of the wrists. The home jerseys are base white with red trim, the away jerseys are base black with red trim, and the alternates are base grey with black trim. Other than the change in color, all three jerseys are similar.\n\n==Season records==\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL = Shootout losses, Pts = Points, PCT = Winning percentage, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalty infraction minutes''\n\n<small>Records as of March 11, 2020.</small><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=106 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 1990\u20131992.]</ref><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=69 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 1992\u20132001.]</ref><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=2694 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 2001\u20132007.]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The team is a member of the [[ECHL]]. Originally established in 1990, the team first played their games in the [[Cincinnati Gardens]] and now play at [[Heritage Bank Center]]. The Cyclones are a minor league affiliate of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] ([[National Hockey League]]) and the [[Rochester Americans]] ([[American Hockey League]]).\n\nCincinnati has fielded Cyclones teams with three separate franchises in two different leagues: the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] (1992\u20132001) and the ECHL (1990\u20131992, 2001\u20132004, 2006\u2013present). Together, the franchises have combined to win two [[Kelly Cup]]s (2008 and 2010), three conference championships (2008, 2010 and 2014), two overall points championships (2008 and 2019), and five division championships (1996, 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2019). In 2007\u201308, the team had the most successful season in ECHL history with 55 wins, 115 points, and its first conference and league championships.\n\n==History==\nThere have been three separate [[Professional sports league organization|franchises]] known as the Cincinnati Cyclones, two in the [[ECHL]] and one in the IHL.\n\n===The early ECHL years: 1990\u20131992===\nThe first franchise to use the name Cincinnati Cyclones was founded in [[1990\u201391 ECHL season|1990]]. The team played their games at the [[Cincinnati Gardens]]. They lost in the first round of the playoffs in the 1990\u201391 season. In the [[1991\u201392 ECHL season|1991\u201392 season]], the Cyclones lost in the Riley Cup semifinals. The team's owner at the time, [[Doug Kirchhofer]], was granted an [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] franchise and chose to move the Cyclones name to that franchise. He then sold the ECHL franchise to Art Clarkson of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to form the new [[Birmingham Bulls (ECHL)|Birmingham Bulls]].\n\n===The IHL years: 1992\u20132001===\nThe first season in the IHL, Cincinnati failed to qualify for the postseason, which would be the first of only two seasons in which they did not qualify. [[Paul Lawless]], who would eventually be head coach and vice president of player development and have his number retired, began his first of several stints with the team in the [[1992\u201393 IHL season|1992\u201393 season]]. On April 2, 2004, during his number retirement ceremony, he was singled out as a reason for the team's success, both on the ice and in attendance. During the IHL years, the Cyclones set a team record of eight consecutive 90+ point seasons,<ref>{{citeweb| url = http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/display_standings.php?tmi=5255 | title = Cincinnati Cyclones season standings | website = hockeydb.com | date = 2012-03-04 | accessdate = 2012-03-04}}</ref> ending when the International Hockey League ceased operations in 2001. During the Cyclones nine years in the IHL, they won their only division and conference regular season championships in the [[1995\u201396 IHL season|1995\u201396 season]], but lost in a seven-game semifinal series to the [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]].\n\nIn 1997, the Cyclones' lease agreement with the Cincinnati Gardens came to an end when the two sides were unable to reach an agreement for a new contract. Team owner, Doug Kirchhofer, purchased what then was known as Riverfront Coliseum in downtown Cincinnati, renamed it The Crown and renovated the arena. During the seven seasons the Cyclones were in the arena, the venue was renamed the Firstar Center and now is known as [[Heritage Bank Center]]. The team has since been unsuccessful in reclaiming the higher attendance numbers from the Cincinnati Gardens, until the 2008 Kelly Cup, where they drew 12,722 fans to the last game of the postseason.<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://echl.leaguestat.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=5345 | title = Cyclones reclaim success from past | publisher = [[ECHL]] | date = 2005-04-05 | accessdate = 2005-04-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607192827/http://echl.leaguestat.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=5345 | archive-date = 2008-06-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Return to the ECHL: 2001\u20132004===\nThe third Cyclones franchise started in the [[1995\u201396 ECHL season|1995]] as the [[Louisville RiverFrogs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. After three years, the team moved to [[Miami]] as the [[Miami Matadors]]. After the [[1998\u201399 ECHL season|lone season]] in Florida, the franchise eventually came into the ownership of a group in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and the franchise went into inactive status while ownership looked into locations for their team. Upon the folding of the IHL, the Cyclones name was sold to this ownership group who moved the franchise to Cincinnati to become the new Cyclones.\n\nThe first year back in the ECHL ended the team's streak of 90+ point seasons with the Cyclones finishing just 12 points shy despite a 10-game fewer season length. Former Cyclones player [[Paul Lawless]] became head coach, as a mid-season replacement for Ray Edwards.\n\nBefore the start of the [[2003\u201304 ECHL season|2003\u201304 season]] former Cyclones player and assistant coach [[Chris Cichocki]] left the [[Arkansas RiverBlades]] in order to return as the Cyclones head coach. Despite his success with Arkansas, Cichocki led the team to their worst season with 54 points and failed to make the playoffs for the second time in team history.\n\nShortly after ending the season without a playoff berth, in April 2004, the Cyclones suspended operations. This suspension was mainly due to lack of revenue and safe access to the arena as it was limited by construction in Downtown Cincinnati. This dormancy left Cincinnati hockey to the cross-town, Cincinnati Gardens-based [[American Hockey League|AHL]] rival, [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] and stopped the city's record of two minor league hockey teams in the same city for consecutive years. The Cincinnati Mighty Ducks suspended operations in 2005 after their NHL affiliate, the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], switched their affiliation to the [[Portland Pirates]].\n\n===Resumed play: 2006\u2013present===\nWith minor league hockey dormant in Cincinnati for a year, and plans for the proposed AHL Cincinnati RailRaiders franchise scrapped for [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307]], on April 21, 2006, the Cyclones announced that they would participate in the upcoming [[2006\u201307 ECHL season]]. They returned to play their home games at U.S. Bank Arena, joining their two ECHL, [[Ohio]] rivals, the [[Dayton Bombers]] and [[Toledo Storm]]. They then obtained an affiliation with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]. The Cyclones won their first game back in the ECHL on October 20 against the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]] at U.S. Bank Arena with a score of 3 to 1. Head coach [[Chuck Weber (ice hockey)|Chuck Weber]] was the runner-up for the ECHL's Coach of the Year award for 2006\u201307<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://www.cycloneshockey.com/news_data.php?article=00264 | title = Weber finishes second in Coach of Year voting | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2008-04-01 | accessdate = 2012-03-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614063159/http://www.cycloneshockey.com/news_data.php?article=00264 | archivedate = 2008-06-14 }}</ref> and was re-signed for the [[2007\u201308 ECHL season|2007\u201308 season]].\n\nIn addition to the Montreal/Hamilton affiliation, the Cyclones added the NHL's [[Nashville Predators]] and the AHL's [[Milwaukee Admirals]] as affiliates in 2007. The Cyclones' 2007\u201308 season saw the club break numerous franchise and league records. Through 50 games, the Cyclones were 31 games over .500. Attendance at games had increased nearly 40% over 2006\u201307 and the club had already surpassed their win total from 2006\u201307 (37).

Individually, Chuck Weber was named ECHL coach of the year, earning him the John Brophy trophy. David Desharnais claimed three ECHL awards: Most Valuable Player, Rookie of the Year, and the Leading Scorer award with 29 goals and 77 assists for 106 points. In addition, Chad Starling won the award for the highest [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|plus/minus]] rating.\n\nThe Cyclones entered the playoffs and defeated the [[Johnstown Chiefs]] four games to none. The Cyclones moved on to take on the [[Reading Royals]], Cincinnati took the series in seven games to claim their second ever North Division playoff title. The Cyclones then defeated the [[South Carolina Stingrays]], 2\u20131 in overtime, to claim the American Conference Championship in five games.  With their victory, Cincinnati also claimed the E.A. \"Bud\" Gingher Memorial Trophy.\n\nThe Cyclones then defeated the National Conference Champion [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] in the Kelly Cup Finals, clinching their first championship in team history in six games. After splitting the first two games in Cincinnati (Cincinnati 4\u20133 and Las Vegas 1\u20130), the series shifted to Las Vegas, where Cincinnati won games three and five to take a 3\u20132 series lead. In front of a record setting crowd, 12,722 fans, at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati on June 5, the Cyclones defeated Las Vegas in game six, 3\u20131, to take the championship and their 71st win of the season. Goalie Cedrick Desjardins was named the Kelly Cup Playoff MVP.\n\nAfter the Cyclones cup win [[Coach (ice hockey)|coach]] Chuck Weber and [[assistant coach]] Dean Stork received multi-year extensions. Weber was also given the title of vice president. On November 29, Weber picked up his 100th professional head coaching victory with a 6\u20133 win at [[Johnstown Chiefs|Johnstown]].\n\nCincinnati's [[2008\u201309 ECHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was not as successful as the previous one, but they won 41 games for 87 points, repeating as North Division champions. They won a seven-game series against the [[Wheeling Nailers]], including a double overtime game seven win, and swept the [[Elmira Jackals]] to win the North Division playoff title. However, the Cyclones would be swept by the South Carolina Stingrays in the American Conference Finals.\n\nThe [[2009\u201310 ECHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be more successful with 44 wins and 91 points, the wins total being the most in the American Conference. Despite that, the Cyclones finished second in the North Division to the [[Kalamazoo Wings]] and fifth in the conference. This led to a rematch with fourth seeded, and defending champion, South Carolina in the first round, where Cincinnati defeated the Stingrays in five games. Veteran captain Barrett Eghotz scored in overtime for the 3\u20132 win in game five and was the third straight overtime game in the series. The Cyclones then faced the top seeded [[Charlotte Checkers (ECHL)|Charlotte Checkers]], defeating the Checkers in game seven with a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nCincinnati drew the [[Reading Royals]] in the American Conference Final. The seven game series was marred by several incidents, both on and off the ice, that resulted in suspensions and fines to players and staff of both organizations. The worst occurred after game six, when Reading's [[Scott Fletcher (ice hockey)|Scott Fletcher]] allegedly struck a Cincinnati fan with a stick, drawing an indefinite suspension by the league.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Nevertheless, the series made ECHL history when, after losing the first two at home, then game three at Reading, Cincinnati posted wins of 6\u20134, 5\u20130 and 6\u20133 to force the team's third winner-take-all game in the 2010 playoffs. In front of 5,340 fans, the Cyclones posted a 1\u20130 win to become the first team in ECHL history, and the sixth professional hockey team in history,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} to come back from a 3\u20130 deficit to win a best of seven series. The only goal of the contest was scored by [[Barret Ehgoetz]] 13:48 into the game.\n\nThe Cyclones defeated the [[Idaho Steelheads]] in the [[2010 Kelly Cup playoffs|2010 Kelly Cup Final]], four-games-to-one. Cincinnati scored game-winning goals within the last minute in the first two games, a 3\u20132 win on a goal by Mark Van Guilder with 49.2 seconds remaining on May 14, and a 1\u20130 win the next night, when Mathieu Aubin netted the only goal in the contest and only with 20.1 seconds remaining in regulation. The series shifted to US Bank Arena and witnessed an Idaho victory within the first minute of the second overtime of game three, as Evan Barlow received a pass at the bottom of the right circle and fired the puck into a largely vacated goal, as Cyclones goalie Robert Mayer had committed to the left side.\n\nIn front of yet another ECHL playoff record setting crowd of 13,483 at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati, the Cyclones defeated Idaho in game five, 2\u20131, to take the championship. With the victory, the Cyclones clinched their second Kelly Cup title in three years. The game was also the Cyclones 24th Kelly Cup playoff game, surpassing the club record of 22 postseason games played by the 2008 championship team and is one more than South Carolina (23) had in its title run in 2009. Rookie Cyclones goaltenders Robert Mayer and Jeremy Smith were named co-winners of the Kelly Cup playoffs MVP. Cincinnati finished with a total record of 59\u201332\u20134.\n\nThe Cyclones underwent several changes before the [[2010\u201311 ECHL season|2010\u201311 season]] when assistant coach Dean Stork became the head coach of the [[Greenville Road Warriors]] in June and head coach Chuck Weber was promoted to the [[American Hockey League]] as head coach of the [[Rochester Americans]] on July 27. On August 4, Cincinnati signed a new affiliation agreement with the NHL's [[Florida Panthers]], who used Rochester as their AHL farm team, creating a working relationship between Chuck Weber and his former Cyclones team. On August 12, Cincinnati named [[Jarrod Skalde]] as the new head coach. After undergoing this major coaching overhaul and losing a large portion of their roster, the Cyclones went on to post their third lowest points total in franchise history. They were still able to earn a seventh seed in the ECHL playoffs, but lost in the first round to Reading Royals, three-games-to-one.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida Panthers moved their AHL affiliation to the [[San Antonio Rampage]] as well their AHL head coach, Chuck Weber.. Despite heavy support by new AHL affiliate, the [[2011\u201312 ECHL season|2011\u201312 season]] would still be unsuccessful. The Cyclones had a slow start to the season and while they stayed competitive throughout the rest of the season, they earned only 35 wins and 79 points. Cincinnati would finish tenth in the conference, marking only the third time in their 20-season history that they did not make the playoffs.\n\nThe Cyclones made a complete turnaround the next season, beginning the season unbeaten in regulation for the first nine games. Their 42 wins and 92 points won the North Division regular season championship, their third such accolade in six seasons, and placed them second in the Eastern Conference. The season earned head coach Jarrod Skalde Coach of the Year honors. Cincinnati would go on to win a pair of six-game wins against the [[Toledo Walleye]] and [[Gwinnett Gladiators]] before losing a five-game conference final to the top seeded Reading Royals, who would go on to win the Kelly Cup.\n\nOn July 9, 2013, coach Skalde accepted an assistant's position with the AHL's [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]], becoming the second consecutive Cyclones coach to be promoted to a higher level. Before the 2014\u201315 season, Skalde was appointed as Norfolk's head coach.\n\n[[Image:CincinnatiCyclones33013.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Cincinnati Cyclones vs. Evansville IceMen on March 30, 2013]]\nCincinnati came back strong under new head coach [[Ben Simon]] in 2013\u201314, with 41 wins and 91 points for a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Cincinnati would win three series against the [[Orlando Solar Bears (ECHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]], [[Fort Wayne Komets]], and [[Greenville Road Warriors]], all in six games, earning their third trip to the Kelly Cup Finals. They faced the Brabham Cup winning [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]], but would lose the series in six games. Despite the loss in the final, Cincinnati goaltender [[Rob Madore]] was named Most Valuable Player of the [[2014 Kelly Cup playoffs]], becoming the first player from the losing team to win the award in the ECHL's 26-year history, and the fourth Cincinnati goaltender to either win the trophy outright or share the trophy. Madore earned the award after leading the ECHL with all 14 of Cincinnati's playoff wins, 1,493 minutes of play, and a Cincinnati record 756 saves while playing every second of Cincinnati's 24 playoff games.\n\nAfter the season, coach Simon accepted a role with the [[Toronto Marlies]], the top affiliate of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Simon became the third consecutive Cyclones head coach to accept a role in the AHL. Following Simon's promotion, Matt Macdonald became Cincinnati's head coach. In the [[2014\u201315 ECHL season|2014\u201315 season]], Cincinnati finished fifth in the North Division of the Eastern Conference with a record of 31\u201330\u20132\u20139. The team would miss the playoffs by only three points.\n\nOn February 27, 2016, the Cyclones played in front of their first-ever sellout at US Bank Arena with 16,529 fans were in attendance for [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] Night and one dollar pizza slices. While the game was a 3\u20132 shootout loss to the [[Indy Fuel]], the Cyclones set the record for the largest crowd for a professional hockey game in the 41-year history of US Bank Arena.<ref>{{citeweb| url = http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2016/02/cyclones-announce-sellout-for-weekend-finale | title = Cyclones announce sellout for weekend finale | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2016-04-02 | accessdate = 2016-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb| url = http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2016/02/recap-cyclones-drop-shootout-thriller-in-front-of-record-crowd | title = Cyclones drop shootout thriller in front of record crowd | publisher = Cincinnati Cyclones | date = 2016-02-27 | accessdate = 2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\nAfter ten seasons, the Nashville Predators and Milwaukee Admirals ended their affiliation with the Cyclones prior to the [[2017\u201318 ECHL season|2017\u201318 season]]. The Cyclones then found affiliations with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Rochester Americans]]. This is the second time Buffalo has affiliated with a Cincinnati hockey team, after the Sabres' affiliation with the [[Cincinnati Swords]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cycloneshockey.com/news/2017/05/cyclones-agree-on-affiliation-with-buffalo-sabres |title=CYCLONES AGREE ON AFFILIATION WITH BUFFALO SABRES |publisher=Cyclones |date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2018\u201319 ECHL season|2018\u201319 season]], head coach Matt Mcdonald was hired as an assistant with the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] in the AHL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fox19.com/story/38558290/cyclones-head-coach-leaving-cincinnati/ |title=Cyclones head coach leaving Cincinnati |work=Fox19 |date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Matt Thomas (ice hockey)|Matt Thomas]], who then led the team to the regular season title and second [[Brabham Cup]] in franchise history and won the [[John Brophy Award]] for coach of the year. Despite the regular season success, the team lost in the division finals four games to one to the [[Toledo Walleye]].\n\n==Uniform==\nAfter introducing their current mascot, Twister, in 1995, the Cyclones had always included him in their uniform design. In fact, from 1996\u20132014 he was the centerpiece of the jerseys they wore. However, prior to the 2014\u201315 season, the organization did a complete revamp of the uniforms and their colors. Twister was removed from the uniform completely along with the color yellow. The shade of red used was also changed from a darker maroonish style red to a more bright royal red. The logo now is described as being a twister, or cyclone, in the center of a \"C\" standing for, Cincinnati. The jersey concepts also changed from being a classic hockey style to a more modern era look. The home, away, and alternate jerseys have red shoulders and red stripes that begin at the elbow area and wrap around to the underside of the wrists. The home jerseys are base white with red trim, the away jerseys are base black with red trim, and the alternates are base grey with black trim. Other than the change in color, all three jerseys are similar.\n\n==Season records==\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL = Shootout losses, Pts = Points, PCT = Winning percentage, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalty infraction minutes''\n\n<small>Records as of March 11, 2020.</small><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=106 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 1990\u20131992.]</ref><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=69 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 1992\u20132001.]</ref><ref>Hockeydb.com, [http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=2694 Cincinnati Cyclones season statistics and records 2001\u20132007.]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "History of the Cincinnati Bengals", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[Cincinnati]], home of the Bengals.]]\nThe [[Cincinnati Bengals]] are a professional football franchise in the [[National Football League]]. Since starting off as an expansion franchise in the [[American Football League]] in 1968, they have appeared in two Super Bowls, but lost both times to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].\n\n==Origins==\nOn May 24, 1967, [[Cincinnati]] was granted a franchise in the [[American Football League]]. The franchise was sold to a Cincinnati-based ownership group led by [[Paul Brown]].\n\nAs the founder and head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]] from [[1946 NFL season|1946]] to [[1962 NFL season|1962]], Brown led his team to a .759 winning percentage and seven championships, which includes four championships earned while a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]]. The Browns were champions of that league in each of the four years it existed. When the AAFC folded after the [[1949 NFL season|1949]] season, the Browns, as well as the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947-50)|Baltimore Colts]], were absorbed into the National Football League.\n\nBrown became a recognized innovator for his approach to training, game planning, and the passing game. However, he was only a minority owner of the Browns and lacked the resources to buy out the rest of the ownership group. In [[1961 NFL season|1961]], businessman [[Art Modell]] assumed control of the team and on January 9, 1963, Modell controversially fired Brown. Many believe that Modell had tired of complaints of Brown's [[autocracy|autocratic]] style; others claim it was Brown's decision to trade for [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse University's]] [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Ernie Davis]], who was drafted by the [[Washington Redskins]], without Modell's knowledge. However, Davis was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] shortly afterward. Brown didn't want to play Davis; Modell insisted he could play. The relationship between Paul Brown and Art Modell, which was never warm to begin with, deteriorated further. Davis died on May 18, 1963.\n\nBy [[1966 NFL season|1966]], Paul Brown wanted to become involved in professional football again. [[James A. Rhodes]], then the governor of Ohio, convinced Brown that Ohio needed a second team. Cincinnati was deemed a logical choice. Brown initially sought a franchise in the [[National Football League]] but had been rebuffed, in no small part because Cincinnati's largest football venue then in place, [[Nippert Stadium]], was well under the minimum 50,000 capacity the league required for prospective expansion teams.  \n\nBrown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20090122093857/http://cincinnatibengals.com/team/history.asp] Another Bengals team existed in the city and played in a previous American Football League from [[1937 American Football League season|1937]] to 1942. Possibly as an insult to Art Modell, Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering.\n\nA turning point came in 1966 when the American Football League agreed to [[AFL-NFL merger|a merger]] with its older and more established rival. Merger negotiations had been complicated by several factors, one being that members of the [[United States Congress]] were seeking guarantees that any merger would include all existing AFL teams. Under pressure from Congress, NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] had promised that professional football would be maintained in each of the twenty-three markets where it then existed. There were a total of 24 franchises in the two leagues at the time (fifteen in the NFL and nine in the AFL), but the powerful congressional delegation of [[Louisiana]] led by Senator [[Russell Long]] and Congressman [[Hale Boggs]] had further insisted on an NFL franchise in [[New Orleans]] in return for their support. As a result, the [[New Orleans Saints]] became the NFL's sixteenth franchise in 1967, meaning another team would be required if the merged league was to have an even number of teams.\n\nHaving just stocked the Saints' roster, the NFL's owners did not want to risk having the talent pool of their own league becoming further diluted by way of another [[expansion draft]] so they quickly agreed that the second expansion team should join the AFL. From the AFL's perspective, adding another team was highly desirable because the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million \u2013 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the transaction provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\n\nPrior to the merger being announced, Paul Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm |title=Paul Brown |publisher=Conigliofamily.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref> However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short term. An additional consideration was that the AFL was willing to allow Cincinnati to play at Nippert Stadium for the team's two pre-merger seasons. Brown ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970, provided a larger stadium was completed by then.\n\nUltimately, the stadium issue was settled in no small part because the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]] were also in need of a facility to replace the antiquated [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since [[1912 Major League Baseball season|1912]]. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and New York City, which after [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]] had lost both their [[National League]] teams, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, was actively courting [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were increased with the [[Millcreek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.\n\nWith assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium]], which was its working title.\n\nWith the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were moved to the AFL-based [[American Football Conference]]. Unexpected victories for AFL teams in [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl IV|IV]] had persuaded NFL owners, starting with Art Modell, to re-consider the question of divisional alignments and ultimately led to the Browns and Bengals  both being placed in the [[AFC Central]]. An instant [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|rivalry]] was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Modell. The Bengals played their inaugural season in [[1968 AFL season|1968]].\n\n==The first three seasons==\n[[File:NippertStadium.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Nippert Stadium]], located on the [[University of Cincinnati]] campus, served as the Bengals' first home stadium]]\nFor their first two seasons, they played at [[Nippert Stadium]] which is the current home of the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati Bearcats]]. The team finished its first season with a 3\u201311 record, although one bright spot was running back [[Paul Robinson (American football player)|Paul Robinson]]. Robinson rushed for 1,023 yards and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.  In 1970, the Bengals made their first playoff appearance, having finished with the best record in the newly-formed AFC Central division, but lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]].\nFounder [[Paul Brown]] coached the team for its first three seasons, accumulating 15 wins and 27 losses and one tie. One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players with above average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver [[Pat McInally]] attended [[Harvard]], and [[linebacker]] Reggie Williams attended [[Dartmouth College]] and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals\u2019 roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate and went on to have successful careers in [[Play-by-play|commentary]] and [[broadcasting]] as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.\n\n==The 1970s: Growing pains==\n[[File:Riverfront_Stadium_in_Cincinnati,_Ohio.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Riverfront Stadium]], home of the Bengals from 1970 to 1999]]\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], coinciding with the completion of the AFL-NFL merger, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium (later known as Cinergy Field from 1996\u20132002), a home they shared with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] until the team moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]].  Brown, [[Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson]], [[Homer Rice]], and [[Forrest Gregg]] coached the Bengals during the '70s.\n\n===Memorable players from the 1970s===\n*[[Greg Cook]] (1969&ndash;1974) \u2013 Record-setting rookie quarterback whose career was cut short by a devastating shoulder injury the following spring.

Ickey was famous for his \"[[Ickey Shuffle]]\" dance after he would score a [[touchdown]]. He rushed for 1,066 yards, caught 21 passes for 199 yards, and scored an NFL rookie record 15 touchdowns in his first season, but two [[knee]] surgeries cut his promising career short.\n\n===1980s games of note===\n*December 20, 1981 \u2013 The Bengals defeated the [[1981 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 30&ndash;28 in the final regular season game.

The [[wind chill]] factor brought the game-time temperature down to \u221256 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). The Bengals' offensive linemen were on the field with their standard sleeveless jerseys in an effort to intimidate a Charger team more accustomed to the warmer California weather. The game has entered NFL lore as the [[Freezer Bowl]].\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The Bengals playing against the 49ers in Super Bowl XVI.]]\n*'''[[Super Bowl XVI]]''', January 24, 1982 \u2013 Cincinnati appeared in [[Super Bowl XVI]] facing the [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]. Played in [[Detroit]]'s [[Pontiac Silverdome|Silverdome]], it was the first [[Super Bowl]] north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]]. It was also the first Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl III]] to feature two teams who had never appeared in a Super Bowl before. ([[Super Bowl XX]] is the only game since with this feature.) The Bengals hurt themselves early and often in the game. After recovering a fumble from the 49ers on the opening kickoff, the Bengals gave the ball right back to San Francisco by throwing an interception, which led to a 49ers touchdown on their next possession. Later, a [[fumble]] cost the Bengals a sure score and another gave the 49ers a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]]. By halftime, the 49ers had built a 20&ndash;0 lead, the largest halftime margin in Super Bowl history, at the time. The Bengals made a valiant comeback attempt in the second half, and managed to outscore San Francisco by 15 points, but committed even more costly turnovers; another interception and a turnover on downs when the 49ers stuffed an attempted fourth down conversion attempt on the San Francisco one-yard line. Cincinnati ended up losing the game 26&ndash;21 despite outgaining the 49ers in total yards 356 to 274 and setting 3 Super Bowl records: most receptions by one player (11 by Dan Ross), most completions (25 by Ken Anderson), and highest completion percentage (73.5).\n*December 20, 1982 \u2013 On a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' stage, Bengals' quarterback Ken Anderson set a single-game team record by completing 40 passes in a 50&ndash;34 shootout loss to the [[1982 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]].\n*November 28, 1982 \u2013 Defensive back [[Ken Riley]] tied his own franchise record by intercepting 3 passes from [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], leading the Bengals to a 31&ndash;17 win.\n*January 2, 1983 \u2013 In the regular season's final game, the Bengals beat the [[1983 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 35&ndash;27. Cincinnati once again won the [[AFC Central]] division crown. Ken Anderson set an NFL record by completing 20 consecutive passes in the game and finished the season winning his second consecutive passing title. It was the second time in his career he had won the title in back-to-back seasons. Anderson finished the season completing 70.55% of his passes, an NFL single season record.\n*January 9, 1983 \u2013 The [[1983 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] traveled to Cincinnati and beat the Bengals 44&ndash;17 in the first round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]].\n*October 28, 1984 \u2013 Bengals' bruising [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Larry Kinnebrew]] scored four touchdowns setting a team single game scoring record as the Bengals drilled the [[1984 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 31&ndash;13.\n*December 21, 1986 \u2013 In the final game of the [[1986 NFL season|1986 season]], Bengals' quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] set a team record by throwing five touchdown passes as Cincinnati shot down the [[1986 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 52&ndash;21. It was also the last game for Bengals' quarterback Ken Anderson.\n*October 16, 1988 \u2013 After leading Cincinnati to six straight wins to begin the season, [[Boomer Esiason]] set a single game team record throwing 5 interceptions in a 27&ndash;21 loss to the [[1988 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]].\n*November 6, 1988 \u2013 Bengals' [[wide receiver]] Eddie Brown set a single-game team record with 216 receiving yards as the Bengals defeated the [[1988 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] 42&ndash;7 in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium.\n*December 17, 1988 \u2013 In the regular season finale, Bengal [[place kicker]] [[Jim Breech]] kicked a short [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] in overtime to edge the [[1988 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 20&ndash;17.

Quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] finished the season as the NFL's top rated passer.\n*December 31, 1988 \u2013 Cincinnati hosted its fourth NFL playoff game. A sellout crowd at Riverfront Stadium watched the Bengals beat the [[1988 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 21&ndash;13.\n*January 8, 1989 \u2013 The Cincinnati Bengals shut down the [[1988 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 21&ndash;10 to win the organization's second [[AFC Championship]]\n*'''[[Super Bowl XXIII]]''', January 22, 1989 \u2013 The Bengals earned a rematch with the 49ers in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], but lost 20&ndash;16 in [[Miami]]'s [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. The Bengals boasted the highest-scoring offense in 1988, and rebounded from a 4&ndash;12 record in 1987.  But a few unfortunate events prevented the team from capturing the [[world championship]]. The night before the game, Bengals [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Stanley Wilson suffered a \"cocaine relapse\", and did not participate in the game. Head coach [[Sam Wyche]] was forced to alter the game plan only hours before the opening kickoff. Bengals [[All-Pro]] [[nose tackle]] [[Tim Krumrie]] broke his leg in three places while tackling [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] early in the first quarter. At the start of the fourth quarter, Bengals [[cornerback]] Lewis Billups dropped a sure [[interception]] in the [[end zone]] which would have sealed a Cincinnati win. The 49ers [[Jerry Rice]] scored on the next play. Despite all the adversity, the game remained close and the Bengals led the 49ers in the waning minutes of the game until the memorable drive late in the game, capped by a touchdown pass from [[Joe Montana]] to [[John Taylor (American football player)|John Taylor]] with only 34 seconds left in the contest, which erased a Bengal lead and put the 49ers ahead for good.\n*October 29, 1989 \u2013 [[Boomer Esiason]] tied his own record for [[touchdown]] passes in a game as the Bengals beat the [[1989 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 56&ndash;23.

During the game, [[All-Pro]] [[running back]] [[Bo Jackson]] suffered a career ending hip injury on a routine tackle by linebacker Kevin Walker.\n\n==The 1990s: the dark ages==\nPaul Brown, legendary NFL personality and innovator, died in 1991. He had already transferred control to his son, [[Mike Brown (football team owner)|Mike Brown]], but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team. Shortly after his death, the Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse for a long time. During the decade, the team was nicknamed the \"Bungles\" by detractors, as the team began a lengthy playoff drought that lasted until 2005.  Wyche, [[David Shula]], [[Bruce Coslet]], and [[Dick LeBeau]] coached the Bengals in the '90s.\n\n===Memorable players from the 1990s===\n*[[Lee Johnson (American football player)|Lee Johnson]] (1988&ndash;1998) \u2013 Was the Bengals punter for 11 seasons.  Set a Super Bowl record for longest punt with a 63-yard punt in [[Super Bowl XXIII]].  Overall, Johnson played 18 seasons in the NFL and recorded a career total of 51,979 punting yards, the third most in NFL history when he was cut from the team. During the dismal decade Johnson made a bitter comment about team management (referring to individuals higher than the coaches) and was suspended, fined and then cut from the team before the Pickens incident. Johnson was one of the more recognizable and veteran players.\n*[[Carl Pickens]] (1992&ndash;99) and [[Darnay Scott]] (1994&ndash;2001), both wide receivers along with quarterback [[Jeff Blake]] (1994&ndash;99). The trio rekindled the Bengals' identity as a high-powered offense. Pickens was a fast and elusive receiver; he was well disciplined in running routes displaying excellent hands. Scott complimented him with his own amazing speed. Pickens was the more favored target of Blake and when Pickens left, Scott was unable to fill the vacancy. Pickens, with other teams, was nowhere near as successful without Blake as his quarterback. The three worked excellently together and when one wasn't there the chemistry was gone for them as a team or individual.\n\n:*Pickens made the Pro Bowl twice with the Bengals and held the team record for most receptions in the regular season until 2007. He left the team due to personality conflicts (which led to some fines as well as a new player contract clause for later players nicknamed the \"Pickens Clause\" which penalizes players for disparaging remarks about the club or management).\n:*Scott recorded over 800 receiving yards in all of his 7 seasons with the Bengals, with the sole exception of 1997, when he recorded 797 yards.\n:*Blake was the only other quarterback, other than Esiason in 1997, to lead the team to a non-losing record (8-8) during the string of bad seasons. He was famous for his short stature and his \"moon ball\" (nicknamed such for its high arc) which was a very successful play to [[Carl Pickens]] and [[Darnay Scott]]. He was drafted by the Jets under their head coach of the time, Coslet, and came over as a backup to David Klingler when Coslet arrived. He got the start due to injuries and was never challenged for the quarterback position by Klingler again. He was benched after the drafting of [[Akili Smith]]. Blake remained in the league as a starter and backup beyond 2005 whereas neither of his favorite receivers remained in the league for another 2 years after they left the Bengals.\n*[[Corey Dillon]] (1997&ndash;2003) \u2013 Controversial but highly talented running back. He broke many league rookie records (which were subsequently broken in the next year) and Bengal franchise records (which were broken by his replacement [[Rudi Johnson]]). He left the Bengals prior to the 2004 campaign and won [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] with the [[New England Patriots]].

He holds Bengals records for most career rushing yards (8,061) and rushing yards in one game (278).\n*[[Takeo Spikes]] (1998&ndash;2002) \u2013 Fast, strong (tackled hulking and lumbering RB [[Jerome Bettis]] with one hand by the neck collar from behind), emotional and talented inside linebacker. Coupled with [[Brian Simmons]], he was a powerful force and emotional leader for the maligned defense. He left Cincinnati for the Buffalo Bills after the 2-14 2002 season under Dick LeBeau, believing Cincinnati would not turn itself around under rookie head coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals went 27\u201321 over the next three seasons, including an 11-5 AFC North Division Championship season in 2005. The Bills went 20\u201328 over the same period with no postseason appearances.\n*[[Ki-Jana Carter]], [[Dan Wilkinson]], [[Akili Smith]], and [[David Klingler]], were four players drafted during this period touted as \"franchise-saving\" individuals. Whether it was a lack of talent, poor coaching, bad luck with injuries, each one of these drafts proved to be an astoundingly horrible selection. Dan Wilkinson, the first pick of the 1994 draft, is the only one who remained in the league with other teams but never had the \"breakout season\" to justify his 1st-round draft status, high paying initial contract, or being the number one overall draft pick.\n\n===1990s games of note===\n*December 17, 1995 \u2013 The Bengals lose to intrastate rival [[1995 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 26&ndash;10, in the last NFL game ever played at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. It would also be the last game played in the \"Battle of Ohio\" series for the next four years, as the Browns relocated to Baltimore following the '95 season and became the [[Baltimore Ravens]]\n*December 4, 1997 \u2013 Running back [[Corey Dillon]] rushed for 246 yards on 39 carries, breaking the NFL rookie record of 237 yards set by [[Jim Brown]] in 1957.  This mark would later be eclipsed by [[Mike Anderson (running back)|Mike Anderson]] of the [[Denver Broncos]].\n*December 21, 1997 \u2013 Bengals' quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] played his last NFL game. His last play was a 79-yard touchdown play-action pass to [[wide receiver]] [[Darnay Scott]]. Cincinnati won the game 16&ndash;14 against the [[1997 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Boomer finished the season with a 107 [[quarterback rating]].\n*October 10, 1999 \u2013 The Browns return to the NFL and host their intrastate rivals, with the Bengals winning 18\u201317.\n\n==2000s: Return to relevance==\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]], current home of the Bengals, opened in {{nfly|2000}}.]]\n===Intensification of rivalry with Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{main article|Bengals-Steelers rivalry}}\n\nThe Bengals have played the Steelers more than any other team in the NFL (the Browns missed keeping pace by [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|being out of the league for three years]], the Oilers/Titans team was moved from the division, and the Baltimore Ravens are considered a \"new\" franchise as Cleveland retained its rights to the name and history).  LeBeua and [[Marvin Lewis]] coached the Bengals in the 2000s.\n\n===Memorable players in the 2000s===\n[[File:Carson Palmer under center.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Quarterback]] [[Carson Palmer]], [[wide receiver]] #84 [[T.

First Bengals QB to have a 100+ passer rating for the season, and broke several team passing records in his 2nd year as a starter (attempts, completions, and touchdowns). He also tied the NFL record for consecutive games with a 100+ rating during the same season. He holds the Bengals' Single Season Passing Yards with 4035 yards [2006], as well as the record for touchdown passes in a season (32) and single game (6).\n* '''The Johnsons''', wide receiver: [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]], tailback: [[Rudi Johnson]], and fullback: [[Jeremi Johnson]] formed an offensive trio that propelled the Bengals' offense into its high-standing.\n:* [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]] broke the team record for reception yards in consecutive years ('04 & '05 season, 1,400+ yards), also first Bengal ever to lead the NFL in receiving yards in 2006.  In 2007, he became the team's all-time leader in receptions and receiving yards.\n:* [[Rudi Johnson]] broke the team record for rushing yards in consecutive years ('04 & '05 season)\n:* [[Jeremi Johnson]], while used primarily as a blocking fullback, is a very capable receiver and elusive in the open field.\n*[[Willie Anderson (American football)|Willie Anderson]] and [[Levi Jones]] are the left and right tackles. Willie Anderson has started a franchise record number of consecutive games.\n*[[Deltha O'Neal]] and [[Tory James]] alternated leading the Bengals in interceptions, where one or both gained yearly recognition by making it into the Pro Bowl.  In 2005, O'Neal set a franchise record with 10 interceptions.\n*[[Shayne Graham]] signed by the Bengals after being cut from 2 other teams, Graham set a Bengals record by making 88% (22 of 25) of his field goals in his first season with them.  He made the [[Pro Bowl]] in 2005.\n*[[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] was a collegiate teammate of Chad Johnson's at [[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] and, like Johnson, had a troubled history.  Originally a third and fourth receiver, Houshmandzadeh overcame hamstring problems that plagued him in his second year, shed some weight to improve his performance and was promoted to the starting lineup in 2004 with the release of Peter Warrick.  While not quite as fast as Johnson, Houshmandzadeh has proven himself a dependable possession receiver who's willing to make the tough short and medium range catches in traffic where he is prone to taking hard hits.  In 2007, he set the team record for receptions in a season.\n*[[Peter Warrick]] was another Bengals first-round pick that didn't pan out.\n*Linebacker [[Odell Thurman]] and wide receiver [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]]. Both were high draft picks in 2005 and they made immediate positive impacts on the field for the Bengals. Odell was a candidate for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.  Chris Henry provided a second deep threat alongside Chad Johnson and bolstered the offense tremendously. Both, however, had off-field issues involving league substance violations and legal troubles. During their short careers, they had a limited amount of playing time before being released between the 2007\u20132008 seasons. Their non-football related troubles are often considered to be the most visible incidents giving the Bengals a stigma of being in trouble with the law and the league.\n\n===2000s games of note===\n*September 24, 2000 \u2013 The [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] mauled the Bengals 37\u20130 in the most lopsided loss in franchise history. \n*October 22, 2000 \u2013 In a 31\u201321 victory against the [[2000 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], Bengals [[Pro Bowl]] running back [[Corey Dillon]] captured the single-game rushing record. [[Corey Dillon|Dillon]] ran for 278 yards breaking the previous mark set by the [[Chicago Bears]]' [[Walter Payton]]. [[Jamal Lewis]] of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] broke [[Corey Dillon|Dillon's]] record in 2003.\n*December 8, 2002 \u2013 The [[2002 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] dropped 52 points on the Bengals, the most ever relinquished by any Bengal team. The final score was 52\u2013\u201331.\n*September 24, 2005 \u2013 After forcing five [[interceptions]] the previous week against the Vikings, the Bengals intercepted five more this game against the Bears. In doing so, the team accomplished a feat that had not been done in 34 years. The last team to have back-to-back games with 5 or more interceptions was the 1971 Browns. Later in the season, they faced the [[Green Bay Packers]], another NFC North team, and also intercepted 5 passes on their way to victory.\n*December 18, 2005 \u2013 The Bengals clinch the AFC North title and their first playoff appearance in fifteen years with a 41\u201317 rout of the [[Detroit Lions]]. [[Carson Palmer]] (QB) sets a franchise record with 32 touchdown passes in a single season and [[Deltha O'Neal]] (CB) set a franchise record for most interceptions in a season with 10.\n\n'''AFC Wild-Card Round'''\n*January 8, 2006 \u2013 The Bengals hosted their first ever playoff game at [[Paul Brown Stadium]], against the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Star quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] was injured on Cincinnati's second play from scrimmage, his first postseason pass attempt, (which was completed to rookie wide receiver [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]] for a Bengals postseason record play of 66 yards; Henry was also injured on that very play) with a torn ACL, and the team failed to rally around [[Jon Kitna]]. Multiple injuries and many fights marred the game.  The Steelers defeated the Bengals in the wild-card playoff game, 31\u201317.\n\n===2000\u20132005===\nThe Bengals began to emerge from more than a decade of being the worst-performing team of that era (edging out the Cardinals) into a new era of increased consistency under Marvin Lewis, after the team finished with its worst record in history in 2002 with a 2\u201314 record. Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003 but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Carson was promoted to starting quarterback the following season and Kitna, apparently happily, took the position of backup quarterback and embraced the role of mentor for the young quarterback.\n\n[[Paul Brown Stadium]] was built for the 2000 season using private and public money. In tribute to his father, Mike Brown refused corporate offers to have the stadium renamed for their company which became a trend in the NFL and other sports team around that time.\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] became known for their players' off-field and non-football related violations of league substance policies and legal troubles.\n\n===2006\u20132008===\nAfter making the playoffs for the first time since 1990, the Bengals regressed to 8\u20138 in 2006. They continued to slide the next two years, finishing with a 7\u20139 record in 2007 and 4\u201311\u20131 in 2008. In all three years, numerous Bengals players aside from Henry and Thurman were involved with legal issues. In 2008, Carson Palmer suffered a season-ending injury, leading to backup [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] playing for most of the season.\n\n===2009===\n{{main article|2009 Cincinnati Bengals season}}\nThe season opener against [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] was a 12\u20137 defeat, but afterward the Bengals won four in a row against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], [[2009 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], [[2009 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]], and [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]]. The team lost at home to the [[2009 Houston Texans season|Texans]], then beat the [[2009 Chicago Bears season|Bears]], Ravens, and Steelers. In Week 11 however, Cincinnati fell into a trap game when it lost to the 3\u20137 [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. After another defeat of Cleveland, the Bengals had won all six of their divisional matches for the year. Following the next game (an easy win at home over [[2009 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]), Chad Ochocinco was fined $20,000 by the NFL for donning a poncho and sombrero after scoring a touchdown (he had been fined three weeks earlier for joking about bribing the referees). Week 14 saw the Bengals travel to Minnesota, where the [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] routed them 30\u201310. During the week after that game, tragedy struck when Chris Henry fell out of a pickup truck during a domestic dispute and died from his injuries. The team's previously lighthearted mood turned to one of mourning, and they lost the next match against [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]]. After a victory over the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]], the Bengals secured the AFC North title for only their second playoff berth since 1990. They traveled to the Meadowlands for a match with the New York Jets, but still shaken from Chris Henry's death, they were shut out 37\u20130. The Bengals and Jets had to face each other again in the wild-card round of the playoffs, but now in Cincinnati. Their season, which looked so promising a few weeks earlier, ended with a whimper as the Jets won a second time, the score being 24\u201314.\n\n==2010s: the Andy Dalton era==\n{{Update section|date=May 2019}}\nLewis and [[Zac Taylor]] have coached the Bengals in the 2010s.<ref name =\"ZacTaylor Hiring\">{{cite web |title=Zac Taylor Named 10th Bengals Head Coach |url=https://www.bengals.com/news/zac-taylor-named-10th-bengals-head-coach |website=Bengals.com}}</ref>\n\n===Players of note===\n* [[Andy Dalton]], quarterback.

Mike Brown flatly refused to either release or trade him, and Palmer instead announced his plans to retire from the NFL. Another familiar face departed when Chad Ochocinco was traded to New England in August. With this, the Bengals decided to name unproven rookie QB [[Andy Dalton]] as their starter. On October 17, Palmer, who had been holding out since Brown announced he refused to trade him, was traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for 2 first round picks in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]]. The Bengals finished with a record of 9-7 and qualified for the playoffs as the 6th seed in the AFC.

Since starting off as an expansion franchise in the [[American Football League]] in 1968, they have appeared in two Super Bowls, but lost both times to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].\n\n==Origins==\nOn May 24, 1967, [[Cincinnati]] was granted a franchise in the [[American Football League]]. The franchise was sold to a Cincinnati-based ownership group led by [[Paul Brown]].\n\nAs the founder and head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]] from [[1946 NFL season|1946]] to [[1962 NFL season|1962]], Brown led his team to a .759 winning percentage and seven championships, which includes four championships earned while a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]]. The Browns were champions of that league in each of the four years it existed. When the AAFC folded after the [[1949 NFL season|1949]] season, the Browns, as well as the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947-50)|Baltimore Colts]], were absorbed into the National Football League.\n\nBrown became a recognized innovator for his approach to training, game planning, and the passing game. However, he was only a minority owner of the Browns and lacked the resources to buy out the rest of the ownership group. In [[1961 NFL season|1961]], businessman [[Art Modell]] assumed control of the team and on January 9, 1963, Modell controversially fired Brown. Many believe that Modell had tired of complaints of Brown's [[autocracy|autocratic]] style; others claim it was Brown's decision to trade for [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse University's]] [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Ernie Davis]], who was drafted by the [[Washington Redskins]], without Modell's knowledge. However, Davis was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] shortly afterward. Brown didn't want to play Davis; Modell insisted he could play. The relationship between Paul Brown and Art Modell, which was never warm to begin with, deteriorated further. Davis died on May 18, 1963.\n\nBy [[1966 NFL season|1966]], Paul Brown wanted to become involved in professional football again. [[James A. Rhodes]], then the governor of Ohio, convinced Brown that Ohio needed a second team. Cincinnati was deemed a logical choice. Brown initially sought a franchise in the [[National Football League]] but had been rebuffed, in no small part because Cincinnati's largest football venue then in place, [[Nippert Stadium]], was well under the minimum 50,000 capacity the league required for prospective expansion teams.  \n\nBrown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20090122093857/http://cincinnatibengals.com/team/history.asp] Another Bengals team existed in the city and played in a previous American Football League from [[1937 American Football League season|1937]] to 1942. Possibly as an insult to Art Modell, Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering.\n\nA turning point came in 1966 when the American Football League agreed to [[AFL-NFL merger|a merger]] with its older and more established rival. Merger negotiations had been complicated by several factors, one being that members of the [[United States Congress]] were seeking guarantees that any merger would include all existing AFL teams. Under pressure from Congress, NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] had promised that professional football would be maintained in each of the twenty-three markets where it then existed. There were a total of 24 franchises in the two leagues at the time (fifteen in the NFL and nine in the AFL), but the powerful congressional delegation of [[Louisiana]] led by Senator [[Russell Long]] and Congressman [[Hale Boggs]] had further insisted on an NFL franchise in [[New Orleans]] in return for their support. As a result, the [[New Orleans Saints]] became the NFL's sixteenth franchise in 1967, meaning another team would be required if the merged league was to have an even number of teams.\n\nHaving just stocked the Saints' roster, the NFL's owners did not want to risk having the talent pool of their own league becoming further diluted by way of another [[expansion draft]] so they quickly agreed that the second expansion team should join the AFL. From the AFL's perspective, adding another team was highly desirable because the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million \u2013 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the transaction provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.\n\nPrior to the merger being announced, Paul Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League, and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm |title=Paul Brown |publisher=Conigliofamily.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref> However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short term. An additional consideration was that the AFL was willing to allow Cincinnati to play at Nippert Stadium for the team's two pre-merger seasons. Brown ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL when after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970, provided a larger stadium was completed by then.\n\nUltimately, the stadium issue was settled in no small part because the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]] were also in need of a facility to replace the antiquated [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since [[1912 Major League Baseball season|1912]]. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and New York City, which after [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]] had lost both their [[National League]] teams, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, was actively courting [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were increased with the [[Millcreek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.\n\nWith assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium]], which was its working title.\n\nWith the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were moved to the AFL-based [[American Football Conference]]. Unexpected victories for AFL teams in [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl IV|IV]] had persuaded NFL owners, starting with Art Modell, to re-consider the question of divisional alignments and ultimately led to the Browns and Bengals  both being placed in the [[AFC Central]]. An instant [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|rivalry]] was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Modell. The Bengals played their inaugural season in [[1968 AFL season|1968]].\n\n==The first three seasons==\n[[File:NippertStadium.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Nippert Stadium]], located on the [[University of Cincinnati]] campus, served as the Bengals' first home stadium]]\nFor their first two seasons, they played at [[Nippert Stadium]] which is the current home of the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati Bearcats]]. The team finished its first season with a 3-11 record, although one bright spot was running back [[Paul Robinson (American football player)|Paul Robinson]]. Robinson rushed for 1,023 yards and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.  In 1970, the Bengals made their first playoff appearance, having finished with the best record in the newly-formed AFC Central division, but lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]].\nFounder [[Paul Brown]] coached the team for its first three seasons, accumulating 15 wins and 27 losses and one tie. One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players with above average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver [[Pat McInally]] attended [[Harvard]], and [[linebacker]] Reggie Williams attended [[Dartmouth College]] and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals\u2019 roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate and went on to have successful careers in [[Play-by-play|commentary]] and [[broadcasting]] as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.\n\n==The 1970s: Growing pains==\n[[File:Riverfront_Stadium_in_Cincinnati,_Ohio.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Riverfront Stadium]], home of the Bengals from 1970 to 1999]]\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], coinciding with the completion of the AFL-NFL merger, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium (later known as Cinergy Field from 1996\u20132002), a home they shared with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] until the team moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]].

He holds the Bengal record for career passing yards and career touchdown passes. Anderson led his team to the NFL playoffs four times, won three [[AFC Central]] division titles (1973, 1981, 1982) and one [[AFC Championship]]. He used to hold the NFL season completion percentage record (70.6%), set in 1982, and he won four season passing titles. At the time of his retirement, he also held the record for consecutive passes completed (20), set against the [[1982 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] in a regular season game in January 1983, and was 6th in passing yards for a career.

In addition to being a great defensive back, he excelled at kick and punt returning on special teams. Parrish is the Bengals' all-time leader in touchdowns scored by \"return or recovery\" with 13 (4 on punt returns, 4 on interception returns, 3 on fumble returns, 1 on a kickoff return, and 1 on a blocked field goal return).

Ken Anderson won his second consecutive NFL passing title.\n*December 28, 1975 \u2013 In the organization's third playoff game, the Bengals once again had to travel. Despite a 14&ndash;10 victory over the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in week five of the regular season, the Raiders top the Bengals in Oakland, 31&ndash;28.\n*December 12, 1976 \u2013 During the final game of the [[1976 NFL season|season]] in New York City's [[Shea Stadium]], Bengals' defensive end Coy Bacon sacked [[New York Jets]]' quarterback [[Joe Namath]] four times in a 42&ndash;3 Bengals' rout.

It was also the first Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl III]] to feature two teams who had never appeared in a Super Bowl before. ([[Super Bowl XX]] is the only game since with this feature.) The Bengals hurt themselves early and often in the game. After recovering a fumble from the 49ers on the opening kickoff, the Bengals gave the ball right back to San Francisco by throwing an interception, which led to a 49ers touchdown on their next possession. Later, a [[fumble]] cost the Bengals a sure score and another gave the 49ers a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]]. By halftime, the 49ers had built a 20&ndash;0 lead, the largest halftime margin in Super Bowl history, at the time.

The night before the game, Bengals [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Stanley Wilson suffered a \"cocaine relapse\", and did not participate in the game.

Bengals [[All-Pro]] [[nose tackle]] [[Tim Krumrie]] broke his leg in three places while tackling [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] early in the first quarter. At the start of the fourth quarter, Bengals [[cornerback]] Lewis Billups dropped a sure [[interception]] in the [[end zone]] which would have sealed a Cincinnati win. The 49ers [[Jerry Rice]] scored on the next play.

Shortly after his death, the Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse for a long time. During the decade, the team was nicknamed the \"Bungles\" by detractors, as the team began a lengthy playoff drought that lasted until 2005.  Wyche, [[David Shula]], [[Bruce Coslet]], and [[Dick LeBeau]] coached the Bengals in the '90s.\n\n===Memorable players from the 1990s===\n*[[Lee Johnson (American football player)|Lee Johnson]] (1988&ndash;1998) \u2013 Was the Bengals punter for 11 seasons.

Overall, Johnson played 18 seasons in the NFL and recorded a career total of 51,979 punting yards, the third most in NFL history when he was cut from the team. During the dismal decade Johnson made a bitter comment about team management (referring to individuals higher than the coaches) and was suspended, fined and then cut from the team before the Pickens incident. Johnson was one of the more recognizable and veteran players.\n*[[Carl Pickens]] (1992&ndash;99) and [[Darnay Scott]] (1994&ndash;2001), both wide receivers along with quarterback [[Jeff Blake]] (1994&ndash;99). The trio rekindled the Bengals' identity as a high-powered offense. Pickens was a fast and elusive receiver; he was well disciplined in running routes displaying excellent hands. Scott complimented him with his own amazing speed. Pickens was the more favored target of Blake and when Pickens left, Scott was unable to fill the vacancy. Pickens, with other teams, was nowhere near as successful without Blake as his quarterback. The three worked excellently together and when one wasn't there the chemistry was gone for them as a team or individual.\n\n:*Pickens made the Pro Bowl twice with the Bengals and held the team record for most receptions in the regular season until 2007. He left the team due to personality conflicts (which led to some fines as well as a new player contract clause for later players nicknamed the \"Pickens Clause\" which penalizes players for disparaging remarks about the club or management).\n:*Scott recorded over 800 receiving yards in all of his 7 seasons with the Bengals, with the sole exception of 1997, when he recorded 797 yards.\n:*Blake was the only other quarterback, other than Esiason in 1997, to lead the team to a non-losing record (8-8) during the string of bad seasons. He was famous for his short stature and his \"moon ball\" (nicknamed such for its high arc) which was a very successful play to [[Carl Pickens]] and [[Darnay Scott]]. He was drafted by the Jets under their head coach of the time, Coslet, and came over as a backup to David Klingler when Coslet arrived. He got the start due to injuries and was never challenged for the quarterback position by Klingler again. He was benched after the drafting of [[Akili Smith]]. Blake remained in the league as a starter and backup beyond 2005 whereas neither of his favorite receivers remained in the league for another 2 years after they left the Bengals.\n*[[Corey Dillon]] (1997&ndash;2003) \u2013 Controversial but highly talented running back. He broke many league rookie records (which were subsequently broken in the next year) and Bengal franchise records (which were broken by his replacement [[Rudi Johnson]]). He left the Bengals prior to the 2004 campaign and won [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] with the [[New England Patriots]]. Left the Bengals with insulting statements which many Bengals' fans reacted to with anger.  He holds Bengals records for most career rushing yards (8,061) and rushing yards in one game (278).\n*[[Takeo Spikes]] (1998&ndash;2002) \u2013 Fast, strong (tackled hulking and lumbering RB [[Jerome Bettis]] with one hand by the neck collar from behind), emotional and talented inside linebacker. Coupled with [[Brian Simmons]], he was a powerful force and emotional leader for the maligned defense. He left Cincinnati for the Buffalo Bills after the 2-14 2002 season under Dick LeBeau, believing Cincinnati would not turn itself around under rookie head coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals went 27-21 over the next three seasons, including an 11-5 AFC North Division Championship season in 2005. The Bills went 20-28 over the same period with no postseason appearances.\n*[[Ki-Jana Carter]], [[Dan Wilkinson]], [[Akili Smith]], and [[David Klingler]], were four players drafted during this period touted as \"franchise-saving\" individuals. Whether it was a lack of talent, poor coaching, bad luck with injuries, each one of these drafts proved to be an astoundingly horrible selection. Dan Wilkinson, the first pick of the 1994 draft, is the only one who remained in the league with other teams but never had the \"breakout season\" to justify his 1st-round draft status, high paying initial contract, or being the number one overall draft pick.\n\n===1990s games of note===\n*December 17, 1995 \u2013 The Bengals lose to intrastate rival [[1995 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 26&ndash;10, in the last NFL game ever played at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. It would also be the last game played in the \"Battle of Ohio\" series for the next four years, as the Browns relocated to Baltimore following the '95 season and became the [[Baltimore Ravens]]\n*December 4, 1997 \u2013 Running back [[Corey Dillon]] rushed for 246 yards on 39 carries, breaking the NFL rookie record of 237 yards set by [[Jim Brown]] in 1957.  This mark would later be eclipsed by [[Mike Anderson (running back)|Mike Anderson]] of the [[Denver Broncos]].\n*December 21, 1997 \u2013 Bengals' quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] played his last NFL game. His last play was a 79-yard touchdown play-action pass to [[wide receiver]] [[Darnay Scott]]. Cincinnati won the game 16&ndash;14 against the [[1997 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Boomer finished the season with a 107 [[quarterback rating]].\n*October 10, 1999 \u2013 The Browns return to the NFL and host their intrastate rivals, with the Bengals winning 18\u201317.\n\n==2000s: Return to relevance==\n[[File:Cincinnati-paul-brown-stadium2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Paul Brown Stadium]], current home of the Bengals, opened in {{nfly|2000}}.]]\n===Intensification of rivalry with Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{main article|Bengals-Steelers rivalry}}\n\nThe Bengals have played the Steelers more than any other team in the NFL (the Browns missed keeping pace by [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|being out of the league for three years]], the Oilers/Titans team was moved from the division, and the Baltimore Ravens are considered a \"new\" franchise as Cleveland retained its rights to the name and history).  LeBeua and [[Marvin Lewis]] coached the Bengals in the 2000s.\n\n===Memorable players in the 2000s===\n[[File:Carson Palmer under center.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Quarterback]] [[Carson Palmer]], [[wide receiver]] #84 [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]], and the rest of the Bengals line up to play the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 2006.]]\n\n*[[Carson Palmer]], 2002 [[Heisman Trophy]] Award winner. First Bengals QB to have a 100+ passer rating for the season, and broke several team passing records in his 2nd year as a starter (attempts, completions, and touchdowns). He also tied the NFL record for consecutive games with a 100+ rating during the same season. He holds the Bengals' Single Season Passing Yards with 4035 yards [2006], as well as the record for touchdown passes in a season (32) and single game (6).\n* '''The Johnsons''', wide receiver: [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]], tailback: [[Rudi Johnson]], and fullback: [[Jeremi Johnson]] formed an offensive trio that propelled the Bengals' offense into its high-standing.\n:* [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]] broke the team record for reception yards in consecutive years ('04 & '05 season, 1,400+ yards), also first Bengal ever to lead the NFL in receiving yards in 2006.  In 2007, he became the team's all-time leader in receptions and receiving yards.\n:* [[Rudi Johnson]] broke the team record for rushing yards in consecutive years ('04 & '05 season)\n:* [[Jeremi Johnson]], while used primarily as a blocking fullback, is a very capable receiver and elusive in the open field.\n*[[Willie Anderson (American football)|Willie Anderson]] and [[Levi Jones]] are the left and right tackles. Willie Anderson has started a franchise record number of consecutive games.\n*[[Deltha O'Neal]] and [[Tory James]] alternated leading the Bengals in interceptions, where one or both gained yearly recognition by making it into the Pro Bowl.  In 2005, O'Neal set a franchise record with 10 interceptions.\n*[[Shayne Graham]] signed by the Bengals after being cut from 2 other teams, Graham set a Bengals record by making 88% (22 of 25) of his field goals in his first season with them.  He made the [[Pro Bowl]] in 2005.\n*[[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] was a collegiate teammate of Chad Johnson's at [[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] and, like Johnson, had a troubled history.  Originally a third and fourth receiver, Houshmandzadeh overcame hamstring problems that plagued him in his second year, shed some weight to improve his performance and was promoted to the starting lineup in 2004 with the release of Peter Warrick.  While not quite as fast as Johnson, Houshmandzadeh has proven himself a dependable possession receiver who's willing to make the tough short and medium range catches in traffic where he is prone to taking hard hits.  In 2007, he set the team record for receptions in a season.\n*[[Peter Warrick]] was another Bengals first-round pick that didn't pan out.\n*Linebacker [[Odell Thurman]] and wide receiver [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]]. Both were high draft picks in 2005 and they made immediate positive impacts on the field for the Bengals. Odell was a candidate for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.  Chris Henry provided a second deep threat alongside Chad Johnson and bolstered the offense tremendously. Both, however, had off-field issues involving league substance violations and legal troubles. During their short careers, they had a limited amount of playing time before being released between the 2007\u20132008 seasons. Their non-football related troubles are often considered to be the most visible incidents giving the Bengals a stigma of being in trouble with the law and the league.\n\n===2000s games of note===\n*September 24, 2000 \u2013 The [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] mauled the Bengals 37\u20130 in the most lopsided loss in franchise history. \n*October 22, 2000 \u2013 In a 31\u201321 victory against the [[2000 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], Bengals [[Pro Bowl]] running back [[Corey Dillon]] captured the single-game rushing record. [[Corey Dillon|Dillon]] ran for 278 yards breaking the previous mark set by the [[Chicago Bears]]' [[Walter Payton]]. [[Jamal Lewis]] of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] broke [[Corey Dillon|Dillon's]] record in 2003.\n*December 8, 2002 \u2013 The [[2002 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] dropped 52 points on the Bengals, the most ever relinquished by any Bengal team. The final score was 52\u2013\u201331.\n*September 24, 2005 \u2013 After forcing five [[interceptions]] the previous week against the Vikings, the Bengals intercepted five more this game against the Bears. In doing so, the team accomplished a feat that had not been done in 34 years. The last team to have back-to-back games with 5 or more interceptions was the 1971 Browns. Later in the season, they faced the [[Green Bay Packers]], another NFC North team, and also intercepted 5 passes on their way to victory.\n*December 18, 2005 \u2013 The Bengals clinch the AFC North title and their first playoff appearance in fifteen years with a 41\u201317 rout of the [[Detroit Lions]]. [[Carson Palmer]] (QB) sets a franchise record with 32 touchdown passes in a single season and [[Deltha O'Neal]] (CB) set a franchise record for most interceptions in a season with 10.\n\n'''AFC Wild-Card Round'''\n*January 8, 2006 \u2013 The Bengals hosted their first ever playoff game at [[Paul Brown Stadium]], against the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Star quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] was injured on Cincinnati's second play from scrimmage, his first postseason pass attempt, (which was completed to rookie wide receiver [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]] for a Bengals postseason record play of 66 yards; Henry was also injured on that very play) with a torn ACL, and the team failed to rally around [[Jon Kitna]]. Multiple injuries and many fights marred the game.  The Steelers defeated the Bengals in the wild-card playoff game, 31\u201317.\n\n===2000\u20132005===\nThe Bengals began to emerge from more than a decade of being the worst-performing team of that era (edging out the Cardinals) into a new era of increased consistency under Marvin Lewis, after the team finished with its worst record in history in 2002 with a 2\u201314 record. Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003 but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Carson was promoted to starting quarterback the following season and Kitna, apparently happily, took the position of backup quarterback and embraced the role of mentor for the young quarterback.\n\n[[Paul Brown Stadium]] was built for the 2000 season using private and public money. In tribute to his father, Mike Brown refused corporate offers to have the stadium renamed for their company which became a trend in the NFL and other sports team around that time.\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] became known for their players' off-field and non-football related violations of league substance policies and legal troubles.\n\n===2006\u20132008===\nAfter making the playoffs for the first time since 1990, the Bengals regressed to 8\u20138 in 2006. They continued to slide the next two years, finishing with a 7\u20139 record in 2007 and 4\u201311\u20131 in 2008. In all three years, numerous Bengals players aside from Henry and Thurman were involved with legal issues. In 2008, Carson Palmer suffered a season-ending injury, leading to backup [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] playing for most of the season.\n\n===2009===\n{{main article|2009 Cincinnati Bengals season}}\nThe season opener against [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] was a 12\u20137 defeat, but afterward the Bengals won four in a row against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], [[2009 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], [[2009 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]], and [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]]. The team lost at home to the [[2009 Houston Texans season|Texans]], then beat the [[2009 Chicago Bears season|Bears]], Ravens, and Steelers. In Week 11 however, Cincinnati fell into a trap game when it lost to the 3\u20137 [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. After another defeat of Cleveland, the Bengals had won all six of their divisional matches for the year. Following the next game (an easy win at home over [[2009 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]), Chad Ochocinco was fined $20,000 by the NFL for donning a poncho and sombrero after scoring a touchdown (he had been fined three weeks earlier for joking about bribing the referees). Week 14 saw the Bengals travel to Minnesota, where the [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] routed them 30-10. During the week after that game, tragedy struck when Chris Henry fell out of a pickup truck during a domestic dispute and died from his injuries. The team's previously lighthearted mood turned to one of mourning, and they lost the next match against [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]]. After a victory over the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]], the Bengals secured the AFC North title for only their second playoff berth since 1990. They traveled to the Meadowlands for a match with the New York Jets, but still shaken from Chris Henry's death, they were shut out 37-0. The Bengals and Jets had to face each other again in the wild-card round of the playoffs, but now in Cincinnati. Their season, which looked so promising a few weeks earlier, ended with a whimper as the Jets won a second time, the score being 24\u201314.\n\n==2010s: the Andy Dalton era==\n{{Update section|date=May 2019}}\nLewis and [[Zac Taylor]] have coached the Bengals in the 2010s.<ref name =\"ZacTaylor Hiring\">{{cite web |title=Zac Taylor Named 10th Bengals Head Coach |url=https://www.bengals.com/news/zac-taylor-named-10th-bengals-head-coach |website=Bengals.com}}</ref>\n\n===Players of note===\n* [[Andy Dalton]], quarterback.

J. Green]] from Georgia. Most of the off-season was marred by a league lockout and Carson Palmer's sudden demand to be traded to another team. Mike Brown flatly refused to either release or trade him, and Palmer instead announced his plans to retire from the NFL. Another familiar face departed when Chad Ochocinco was traded to New England in August. With this, the Bengals decided to name unproven rookie QB [[Andy Dalton]] as their starter. On October 17, Palmer, who had been holding out since Brown announced he refused to trade him, was traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for 2 first round picks in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]]. The Bengals finished with a record of 9-7 and qualified for the playoffs as the 6th seed in the AFC. They lost 31-10 to the [[Houston Texans]] in the Wild Card round.\n\n===2012===\n{{main article|2012 Cincinnati Bengals season}}\nThis was the first non-strike year that the Bengals qualified for the playoffs in back-to-back seasons.

The Bengals attained an 11\u20135 record, winning the AFC North division title. However, their season came to an end in the Wild Card round when the [[2013 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] beat the heavily favored Bengals.\n\n===2014===\n{{main article|2014 Cincinnati Bengals season}}\nHead coach [[Marvin Lewis]] was given authority over many day-to-day football operations by owner [[Mike Brown (Cincinnati Bengals owner)|Mike Brown]] prior to the season.

Backup [[AJ McCarron]] was serviceable, leading the team to finish at 12\u20134 and clinched the AFC North title for the second time in three seasons. The Bengals were set to win their first playoff game since the 1980s against the Steelers in the Wild Card round, but linebacker [[Vontaze Burfict]] inflicted a helmet-to-helmet hit on Steelers receiver [[Antonio Brown]] in the waning seconds of the game, drawing a personal foul penalty.
