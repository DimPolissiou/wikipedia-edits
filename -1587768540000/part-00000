There are two forms: repetition and [[collocation]]. Repetition uses the same word, or synonyms, antonyms, etc. For example, \"Which dress are you going to wear?\" \u2013 \"I will wear my green frock,\" uses the synonyms \"dress\" and \"frock\" for lexical cohesion. Collocation uses related words that typically go together or tend to repeat the same meaning. An example is the phrase \"once upon a time\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coherence (linguistics)]]\n* [[M.A.K.

The [[President of the Republic of China|president]] is the head of state. The government consists of Presidency and five branches (Yuan), the [[Executive Yuan]], [[Legislative Yuan]], [[Judicial Yuan]], [[Examination Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]].\n\nOriginally established in 1912 in [[Nanjing|Nanking]], the Government of the Republic of China relocated several times, and [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|finally moved]] to [[Taipei]] in 1949 because of its military losses in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The government had historically been dominated by the Kuomintang, but the situation has changed as Taiwan evolved into a multi-party democracy.\n\n== Organizational structure ==\nThe government formally consists of the presidency and five branches of government, modeled on Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy of [[Three Principles of the People]].\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | OP  |-|-|-| POT |-|-|-| NSC |POT=[[President of the Republic of China|President]]<br />[[File:Commander-in-Chief_Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg|60px]]|OP={{nowrap|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Office of the President Emblem.svg|50px]]|NSC={{nowrap|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]}}<br />[[File:ROC National Security Council Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{chart| EY  | | LY  | | JY  | | XY  | | CY  |EY={{nowrap|[[Executive Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Executive Yuan Logo.svg|100px]]|LY={{nowrap|[[Legislative Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Legislative Yuan Seal.svg|50px]]|JY={{nowrap|[[Judicial Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Judicial Yuan Logo.svg|50px]]|XY={{nowrap|[[Examination Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Examination Yuan Seal.jpg|50px]]|CY={{nowrap|[[Control Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Control Yuan Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn practice, the system resembles a [[semi-presidential system]] with a uniquely strong presidency, as the President may appoint the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], the [[head of government]], without the consent of the legislature. The President, however, shares limitations found in other semi-presidential systems, including the lack of a strong [[veto]] and no direct control of most administrative policy.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Category!!Name!![[Traditional Chinese character|Chinese]]!!Role\n|-\n|rowspan=4|'''Presidency'''\n|[[President of the Republic of China|President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||[[Head of state]]\n|-\n|[[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u526f\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||\n|-\n|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71\u5e9c}}}}|| rowspan=\"2\" |Advisory and administrative<br />agencies to the President\n|-\n|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u570b\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u6703\u8b70}}}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|'''Five Yuans'''\n|[[Executive Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u884c\u653f\u9662}}}}||[[Executive (government)|Executive]], [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]\n|-\n|[[Legislative Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Legislature]], [[Parliament]]\n|-\n|[[Judicial Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u53f8\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Judiciary]], [[Constitutional court]]\n|-\n|[[Examination Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u8003\u8a66\u9662}}}}||[[Civil service commission]]\n|-\n|[[Control Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u76e3\u5bdf\u9662}}}}||[[Government performance auditing|Auditory]]\n|}\n\n=== Presidency ===\n[[File:Taipei Taiwan Presidential-Office-Building-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidential Office Building]]]]\nThe leadership of the country consists of the two top officials that is directly and jointly elected by the [[Taiwanese people]].\n* [[President of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Vice President of the Republic of China]]\n\nUnder the President, two advisory and administrative agencies are established to supports the work of the President.\n* [[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President (Presidential Office)]]\n** [[Secretary-General to the President, Republic of China|Secretary-General of the Office of the President]]\n* [[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]\n** Secretary-General of the National Security Council\n\n=== Executive Yuan ===\n[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|thumb|right|Executive Yuan]]\n{{Main|Executive Yuan}}\n\nThe Executive Yuan is in charge of the Premier. However, the ROC's political system does not fit traditional models. The Premier is selected by the President without the need for approval from the Legislature, but the Legislature can pass laws without regard for the President, as neither the President nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the President and the Legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. During the tenure of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian the continued control of the Legislative Yuan by the pan-Blue majority caused legislation to repeatedly stall, as the two sides were deadlocked. There is another curiosity of the ROC system; because the ROC was previously dominated by strongman one-party politics, real power in the system shifted from one position to another, depending on what position was currently occupied by the leader of the state (Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]). This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the President rather than the Premier.\n\n=== Legislative Yuan ===\n[[File:Legislative Yuan (0212).JPG|thumb|right|Legislative Yuan]]\n{{Main|Legislative Yuan}}\n\nThe main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with one hundred and thirteen seats. Seventy-three are elected in single member districts; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, and six seats are reserved to represent aboriginal groups. Members serve four-year terms. Although sometimes referred to as a \"[[parliament]]\", the Legislative Yuan, under Sun's political theory, is a branch of government, while only the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]], which is now abolished, with the power to amend the constitution and formerly to elect the President and Vice President, could be considered a parliament.  However, after constitutional amendments effectively transferring almost all of the National Assembly's powers to the Legislative Yuan in the late 1990s, it has become more common for newspapers in Taiwan to refer to the Legislative Yuan as the nation's \"parliament\" (\u570b\u6703, ''gu\u00f3hu\u00ec'').\n\n=== Judicial Yuan ===\n[[File:Judicial Yuan Building 20060521.jpg|thumb|right|Judicial Yuan]]\n{{Main|Judicial Yuan}}\n\nThe Judicial Yuan is the ROC's highest [[judiciary]]. The President and Vice-President of the Judicial Yuan and fifteen Justices form the [[Council of Grand Justices]]. They are nominated and appointed by the President of the Republic, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding Judge and four Associate Judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[trial by jury]] but the right to a [[fair trial|fair]] and [[public trial]] is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.\n\n[[Capital punishment]] is legal. Efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions, although they have not been able to completely abolish the punishment. As of 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese want to keep the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050 |title = Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions |last = Chang |first = Rich |date = 2006-01-02 |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate = 2009-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Examination Yuan ===\n[[File:Examination Yuan main gate 20110603.jpg|thumb|right|Examination Yuan]]\n{{Main|Examination Yuan}}\n\nThe Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants in the Republic of China. As a special branch of government under the [[Three Principles of the People]]. The concept of the Examination Yuan is based on the old [[Imperial examination]] system used in Imperial China.\n\n=== Control Yuan ===\n[[File:Control Yuan.JPG|thumb|right|Control Yuan]]\n{{Main|Control Yuan}}\n\nBased on the traditional Chinese [[censorate]], the Control Yuan is an investigatory agency that monitors the other branches of government. It may be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the European Union, the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States, a political [[ombudsman]], or a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry.\n\n== History ==\nThe Government of the Republic of China was formally established in 1912 in [[Nanking]], with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as President of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] under the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]]. This government moved to [[Beijing]] in the same year with [[Yuan Shikai]] as President, and continued under his successors as the internationally recognized government of [[China]] until 1928. In the [[history of the Republic of China|Republican period]], there were a series of governments, sometimes in rivalry with each other. The [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist government]], led by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], was originally formed as a rival military government under Sun Yat-sen in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. After Sun's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] (1926\u20131928) to unify the country and established the capital in Nanjing. This government gained diplomatic recognition but did not control all the territory of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The essentially one-party rule functioned under Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]], which provided for a transitional period of \"tutelage\", but drew more political parties, including the [[Communist Party of China]] into a [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945). The Tutelage Constitution of 1931 was replaced by the  [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947.<ref>Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng (Qian Duansheng)''The Government and Politics of China, 1912-1949.'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1950).</ref>\n\n=== 1912\u20131928 ===\n{{Main|Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Beiyang Government}}\n<!--Please add new information to the relevant series of articles-->\n[[File:Nanjinglinshizhengfu.jpg|thumb|Cabinet meeting of the Nanjing Provisional Government led by Sun Yat-sen]]\n\nThe first Chinese national government was established on 1 January 1912, in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as the provisional president. Provincial delegates were sent to confirm the authority of the national government, and they later also formed the first parliament. The power of this national government was limited and short-lived, with generals controlling both central and northern [[Provinces of the Republic of China|provinces of China]]. The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. The parliament's authority became nominal; violations of the Constitution by [[Yuan Shikai]], who became president in March 1912, were met with half-hearted motions of censure, and Kuomintang members of the parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered 1,000 [[British pounds]]. Yuan maintained power locally by sending military generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power.\n\nWhen Yuan died, the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government.  However, the real power of the time passed to military leaders, forming the warlord period. The impotent government still had its use; when [[World War I]] began, several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on [[German Empire|Germany]], in order to liquidate German holdings.\n\nThere were also several warlord governments and puppet states sharing the same name.

The first stage was military unification, which was carried out with the Northern Expedition. The second was \"political tutelage\" which was a provisional government led by the KMT to educate people about their political and civil rights, and the third stage was constitutional government. The KMT considered themselves to be at the second stage in 1928. Although the Nanjing decade was far more stable and progressive as compared to the Warlord period which preceded it, it was still marred with widespread violence, official corruption and the ongoing civil war with the [[Communist Party of China|communists]].\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] managed to capture Nanjing on 13 December 1937. The Japanese then proceeded to sack the city, and [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred]] hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians. With the fall of Nanjing, the government was forced to move first to [[Wuhan]], until the city fell on 27 October 1938. It retreated further inland to [[Chongqing]], which was the wartime capital until 1945. Although Chongqing was located in the inland western province of [[Sichuan]], it was nevertheless heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes many times during the course of the war.\n\nWith the end of the war, the National Government moved back to Nanjing. The Kuomintang then proceeded with the drafting of a new constitution for China, which were boycotted by the communists. The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] was adopted by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on 25 December 1946 and went into force a year later. The constitution was seen as the third and final step in Sun Yat-sen's \"Three Stages of Revolution\" - constitutional government. From then on, the government was known simply as the '''Government of the Republic of China''' ({{zh |t = \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u653f\u5e9c |s = \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c |p = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3 Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4 |first = t}}). Chiang Kai-shek was also [[1948 Republic of China presidential elections|elected]] as the [[List of Presidents of the Republic of China|1st President of the Republic of China]] under the constitution by the National Assembly in 1948, with [[Li Zongren]] being elected as Vice-President.\n\nHowever, in 1946, the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] with the communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] resumed despite mediation by the [[United States]]. Stretched and exhausted due to the long war with the Japanese, the Kuomintang-led government faced a disciplined and ever growing communist Red Army, which numbers grew in strength and was renamed as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) in 1946. Although [[National Revolutionary Army|government forces]] were numerically superior and were equipped with modern weapons, they eventually lost due to low morale, defections, poor discipline as well as popular discontent with the ROC government due to skyrocketing inflation, corruption and administrative incompetence. The constitution was also superseded by the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]], which were a series of temporary constitutional provisions mainly to increase the powers of the President and suspended the two-term limit. The temporary provisions were passed by the National Assembly on 10 May 1948. Under intense pressure to take responsibility for the government's bleak outlook during the course of the civil war, Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949. The presidency was passed on to Vice-President Li Zongren, who was however unable to govern effectively due to Chiang pulling the strings behind government as Director-General of the Kuomintang.\n\nWith the fall of Nanjing to the PLA on April 1949, the ROC government moved south to [[Guangzhou]], and then to its wartime capital of Chongqing, and finally to [[Chengdu]]. Sensing that he would eventually lose the mainland to the communists, Chiang secretly started preparations to move the government to the island of Taiwan, which was placed under the ROC's control  on 25 October 1945. Taiwan was seen as a safe haven for Chiang due to it being separated from the mainland by the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}-wide [[Taiwan Strait]]. During that period, more than two million civilians, military personnel and government officials left the mainland for Taiwan. Chiang then declared Taipei as the provisional capital of the Republic of China on 7 December 1949, and left Chengdu for Taipei by air three days later when the city fell to the communists.\n\n=== Since 1949 ===\n[[File:Presidential-Palace-(Taipei).png|thumb|Since 1950, the Presidential Office Building in Taipei has been home to the Office of the President of the Republic of China]]\n{{Main|Politics of the Republic of China}}\n\nBased on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], the [[head of state]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|President]], who is elected by popular vote for a four-year term on the same ticket as the Vice-President. The President has authority over the five administrative branches (''Yuan''): the [[Control Yuan|Control]], [[Examination Yuan|Examination]], [[Executive Yuan|Executive]], [[Judicial Yuan|Judicial]], and [[Legislative Yuan]]s. The President appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.\n\nOriginally, the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] was elected in mainland China in 1947 to officially carry out the duties of choosing the president, to amend the constitution, and to exercise the sovereignty of the citizens, but in fact, the Assembly's role in Taipei seemed to reconfirm the executive powers of President Chiang Kai-shek. The National Assembly was re-established on Taiwan when the government moved. Because it was impossible to hold subsequent elections to represent constituencies in mainland China, representatives elected in 1947-48 held these seats \"indefinitely.\" In June 1990, however, the Council of Grand Justices mandated the retirement, effective December 1991, of all remaining \"indefinitely\" elected members of the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and other bodies. In 2005, the National Assembly permanently abolished itself by ratifying a constitution amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan.\n\nAmending the ROC constitution now requires the approval of three-fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan. This quorum requires at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After passing by the legislature, the amendment needs ratification in a [[referendum]] from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Government of the Republic of China}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-before|before=[[Nationalist government]] of<br>the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]|rows=3}}\n{{s-ttl |title = Government ruling [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]|years=1947&ndash;present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Government ruling [[mainland China]]|years=1947&ndash;1949}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201354)|Central People's Government of<br>the People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1949&ndash;1954}}}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Representative for [[China and the United Nations|China]] in the [[United Nations]]|years=1947&ndash;1971}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Government of China|Government of the<br>People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1971&ndash;present}}}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Government of|title=Governments of Asia}}\n{{Taiwan topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China| ]]\n[[Category:Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the government of the Republic of China since 1948|the government of the People's Republic of China since 1949|Government of China|the government of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1928|Beiyang government|the government of the Republic of China from 1928 to 1948|Nationalist government}}\n{{other uses|Government of China (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|ROC government since 1948}}{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n| title   = Government of the<br>Republic of China\n| t       = \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u653f\u5e9c \n| s       = \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\n| p       = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3 Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4\n| poj     = Tiong-h\u00f4a B\u00een-kok Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa\n| tl      = Tiong-hu\u00e2 B\u00een-kok Ts\u00ecng-h\u00fa\n| phfs    = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 M\u00ecn-koet Ch\u1e73n-f\u00fa\n| buc     = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 M\u00ecng-gu\u00f3k C\u00e9ng-h\u016b\n| altname = Government of Taiwan\n| t2      = \u81fa\u7063\u653f\u5e9c \n| s2      = \u53f0\u6e7e\u653f\u5e9c\n| p2      = T\u00e1iw\u0101n Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4\n| poj2    = T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa\n| tl2     = T\u00e2i-u\u00e2n Ts\u00ecng-h\u00fa\n| phfs2   = Th\u00f2i-v\u00e2n Ch\u1e73n-f\u00fa\n| buc2    = D\u00e0i-u\u0103ng C\u00e9ng-h\u016b\n}}\n{{Politics of Taiwan}}\n\nThe '''Government of the Republic of China''', commonly known as the '''Government of [[Taiwan]]''', is the democratic, constitutional government that exercises control over [[Taiwan]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|other islands]] in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|free area]]. The [[President of the Republic of China|president]] is the head of state. The government consists of Presidency and five branches (Yuan), the [[Executive Yuan]], [[Legislative Yuan]], [[Judicial Yuan]], [[Examination Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]].\n\nOriginally established in 1912 in [[Nanjing|Nanking]], the Government of the Republic of China relocated several times, and [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|finally moved]] to [[Taipei]] in 1949 because of its military losses in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The government had historically been dominated by the Kuomintang, but the situation has changed as Taiwan evolved into a multi-party democracy.\n\n== Organizational structure ==\nThe government formally consists of the presidency and five branches of government, modeled on Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy of [[Three Principles of the People]].\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | OP  |-|-|-| POT |-|-|-| NSC |POT=[[President of the Republic of China|President]]<br />[[File:Commander-in-Chief_Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg|60px]]|OP={{nowrap|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Office of the President Emblem.svg|50px]]|NSC={{nowrap|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]}}<br />[[File:ROC National Security Council Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{chart| EY  | | LY  | | JY  | | XY  | | CY  |EY={{nowrap|[[Executive Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Executive Yuan Logo.svg|100px]]|LY={{nowrap|[[Legislative Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Legislative Yuan Seal.svg|50px]]|JY={{nowrap|[[Judicial Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Judicial Yuan Logo.svg|50px]]|XY={{nowrap|[[Examination Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Examination Yuan Seal.jpg|50px]]|CY={{nowrap|[[Control Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Control Yuan Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn practice, the system resembles a [[semi-presidential system]] with a uniquely strong presidency, as the President may appoint the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], the [[head of government]], without the consent of the legislature.

However, the ROC's political system does not fit traditional models. The Premier is selected by the President without the need for approval from the Legislature, but the Legislature can pass laws without regard for the President, as neither the President nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the President and the Legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. During the tenure of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian the continued control of the Legislative Yuan by the pan-Blue majority caused legislation to repeatedly stall, as the two sides were deadlocked. There is another curiosity of the ROC system; because the ROC was previously dominated by strongman one-party politics, real power in the system shifted from one position to another, depending on what position was currently occupied by the leader of the state (Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]). This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the President rather than the Premier.\n\n=== Legislative Yuan ===\n[[File:Legislative Yuan (0212).JPG|thumb|right|Legislative Yuan]]\n{{Main|Legislative Yuan}}\n\nThe main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with one hundred and thirteen seats. Seventy-three are elected in single member districts; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, and six seats are reserved to represent aboriginal groups. Members serve four-year terms. Although sometimes referred to as a \"[[parliament]]\", the Legislative Yuan, under Sun's political theory, is a branch of government, while only the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]], which is now abolished, with the power to amend the constitution and formerly to elect the President and Vice President, could be considered a parliament.  However, after constitutional amendments effectively transferring almost all of the National Assembly's powers to the Legislative Yuan in the late 1990s, it has become more common for newspapers in Taiwan to refer to the Legislative Yuan as the nation's \"parliament\" (\u570b\u6703, ''gu\u00f3hu\u00ec'').\n\n=== Judicial Yuan ===\n[[File:Judicial Yuan Building 20060521.jpg|thumb|right|Judicial Yuan]]\n{{Main|Judicial Yuan}}\n\nThe Judicial Yuan is the ROC's highest [[judiciary]]. The President and Vice-President of the Judicial Yuan and fifteen Justices form the [[Council of Grand Justices]]. They are nominated and appointed by the President of the Republic, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding Judge and four Associate Judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[trial by jury]] but the right to a [[fair trial|fair]] and [[public trial]] is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.\n\n[[Capital punishment]] is legal. Efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions, although they have not been able to completely abolish the punishment. As of 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese want to keep the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050 |title = Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions |last = Chang |first = Rich |date = 2006-01-02 |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate = 2009-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Examination Yuan ===\n[[File:Examination Yuan main gate 20110603.jpg|thumb|right|Examination Yuan]]\n{{Main|Examination Yuan}}\n\nThe Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants in the Republic of China. As a special branch of government under the [[Three Principles of the People]]. The concept of the Examination Yuan is based on the old [[Imperial examination]] system used in Imperial China.\n\n=== Control Yuan ===\n[[File:Control Yuan.JPG|thumb|right|Control Yuan]]\n{{Main|Control Yuan}}\n\nBased on the traditional Chinese [[censorate]], the Control Yuan is an investigatory agency that monitors the other branches of government. It may be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the European Union, the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States, a political [[ombudsman]], or a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry.\n\n== History ==\nThe Government of the Republic of China was formally established in 1912 in [[Nanking]], with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as President of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] under the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]]. This government moved to [[Beijing]] in the same year with [[Yuan Shikai]] as President, and continued under his successors as the internationally recognized government of [[China]] until 1928. In the [[history of the Republic of China|Republican period]], there were a series of governments, sometimes in rivalry with each other. The [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist government]], led by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], was originally formed as a rival military government under Sun Yat-sen in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. After Sun's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] (1926\u20131928) to unify the country and established the capital in Nanjing. This government gained diplomatic recognition but did not control all the territory of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The essentially one-party rule functioned under Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]], which provided for a transitional period of \"tutelage\", but drew more political parties, including the [[Communist Party of China]] into a [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945). The Tutelage Constitution of 1931 was replaced by the  [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947.<ref>Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng (Qian Duansheng)''The Government and Politics of China, 1912-1949.''

Provincial delegates were sent to confirm the authority of the national government, and they later also formed the first parliament. The power of this national government was limited and short-lived, with generals controlling both central and northern [[Provinces of the Republic of China|provinces of China]]. The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. The parliament's authority became nominal; violations of the Constitution by [[Yuan Shikai]], who became president in March 1912, were met with half-hearted motions of censure, and Kuomintang members of the parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered 1,000 [[British pounds]]. Yuan maintained power locally by sending military generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power.\n\nWhen Yuan died, the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government.  However, the real power of the time passed to military leaders, forming the warlord period. The impotent government still had its use; when [[World War I]] began, several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on [[German Empire|Germany]], in order to liquidate German holdings.\n\nThere were also several warlord governments and puppet states sharing the same name.

The first stage was military unification, which was carried out with the Northern Expedition. The second was \"political tutelage\" which was a provisional government led by the KMT to educate people about their political and civil rights, and the third stage was constitutional government. The KMT considered themselves to be at the second stage in 1928. Although the Nanjing decade was far more stable and progressive as compared to the Warlord period which preceded it, it was still marred with widespread violence, official corruption and the ongoing civil war with the [[Communist Party of China|communists]].\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] managed to capture Nanjing on 13 December 1937. The Japanese then proceeded to sack the city, and [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred]] hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians. With the fall of Nanjing, the government was forced to move first to [[Wuhan]], until the city fell on 27 October 1938. It retreated further inland to [[Chongqing]], which was the wartime capital until 1945. Although Chongqing was located in the inland western province of [[Sichuan]], it was nevertheless heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes many times during the course of the war.\n\nWith the end of the war, the National Government moved back to Nanjing. The Kuomintang then proceeded with the drafting of a new constitution for China, which were boycotted by the communists. The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] was adopted by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on 25 December 1946 and went into force a year later. The constitution was seen as the third and final step in Sun Yat-sen's \"Three Stages of Revolution\" - constitutional government.

After passing by the legislature, the amendment needs ratification in a [[referendum]] from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Government of the Republic of China}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-before|before=[[Nationalist government]] of<br>the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]|rows=3}}\n{{s-ttl |title = Government ruling [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]|years=1947&ndash;present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Government ruling [[mainland China]]|years=1947&ndash;1949}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201354)|Central People's Government of<br>the People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1949&ndash;1954}}}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Representative for [[China and the United Nations|China]] in the [[United Nations]]|years=1947&ndash;1971}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Government of China|Government of the<br>People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1971&ndash;present}}}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Government of|title=Governments of Asia}}\n{{Taiwan topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China| ]]\n[[Category:Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]]\n", "name_user": "ChromeGames923", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link outside of bolding", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Republic_of_China"}
