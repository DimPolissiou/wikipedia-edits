SPURA covers five vacant plots of land acquired as part of a 1965 urban renewal plan, near Delancey and [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand Street]]s. These sites were originally part of the broader [[Seward Park (Manhattan)|Seward Park]] Urban Renewal Area, a federal program designed to tear down several [[tenement]]s to develop [[social housing|low-income housing]], called the [[Cooperative Village]].

However, political corruption abounded, and the new apartments were never built.<ref name=\"nytimes march 2014\"/> The competing forces within the neighborhood had been debating whether the SPURA area should be used to develop [[affordable housing]] within [[Manhattan Community Board 3]]; or be developed as mixed-use \u2013 low- and middle-income as well as commercial; or whether it should be all large commercial retail use.

According to [[Acts 4:36]], Barnabas was a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Jew]]. Named an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] in {{bibleverse|Acts|14:14|KJV}}, he and [[Paul the Apostle]] undertook missionary journeys together and defended [[Gentile]] converts against the [[Judaizers]]. They traveled together making more converts (c. 45\u201347), and participated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50). Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the [[Godfearers|\"God-fearing\"]] Gentiles who attended [[synagogue]]s in various [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] cities of [[Anatolia]].\n\nBarnabas' story appears in the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul mentions him in some of his [[epistle]]s. [[Tertullian]] named him as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], but this and other attributions are conjecture. [[Clement of Alexandria]] and some scholars have ascribed the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] to him, but his authorship is disputed.\n\nAlthough the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was [[martyr]]ed at [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in 61 AD. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. The [[feast day]] of Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.\n\nBarnabas is usually identified as the cousin of [[Mark the Evangelist]] on the basis of the term \"anepsios\" used in [[Colossians 4]], which carries the connotation of \"cousin.\" Some traditions hold that [[Aristobulus of Britannia]], one of the [[Seventy Disciples]], was the brother of Barnabas.\n\n{{bibleverse|Acts|11:24|KJV}} describes Barnabas as \"a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith\".\n\n== Name and etymologies ==\nHis [[Greeks|Hellenic]] [[Jewish]] parents called him Joseph (although the [[Byzantine text-type]] calls him {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03c9\u03c3\u1fc6\u03c2}}, ''I\u014ds\u0113s'', 'Joses', a [[Greek language|Greek]] variant of 'Joseph'), but when recounting the story of how he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in [[Jerusalem]], the [[Book of Acts]] says the apostles called him Barnabas. (The \"s\" at the end is the Greek nominative case ending, and it is not present in the Aramaic form.) The Greek text of [[Acts 4:36]] explains the name as {{lang|grc|\u03c5\u1f31\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2}}, ''hyios parakl\u0113se\u014ds'', meaning \"son of encouragement\" or \"son of consolation\". One theory is that this is from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05d4}}, ''{{transl|sem|bar ne\u1e25m\u0101}}'', meaning 'son (of) consolation'. Another is that it is related to the Hebrew word ''nab\u012b'' (\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, Aramaic ''neb\u012b'') meaning \"prophet\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[David H.

He also appears in several of [[Paul's epistles]].\n\nBarnabas, a native of [[Cyprus]] and a [[Levite]], is first mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] as a member of the early Christian community in [[Jerusalem]], who sold some land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community ({{bibleverse|Acts|4:36-37|KJV}}). When the future [[Paul the Apostle]] returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas introduced him to the apostles ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|9:27|KJV}}). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of [[Gamaliel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/453-Barnabas.php|title=Barnabas|website=eastonsbibledictionary.org}}</ref>\n\nThe successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement ({{bibleverse|Acts|11:20\u201322|KJV}}). He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), \"an admirable colleague\", to assist him. Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year ({{bibleverse|Acts|11:25\u201326|KJV}}). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (44 AD) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.\n\nThey returned to Antioch taking [[John Mark]] with them, the cousin or nephew of Barnabas. Later, they went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of [[Pamphylia]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Lycaonia]] ({{bibleverse|Acts|13:14|KJV}}). After recounting what the governor of Cyprus [[Sergius Paulus]] believed, {{bibleverse|Acts|13:9|KJV}} speaks of Barnabas's companion no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his [[Roman naming conventions|Roman name]], and generally refers to the two no longer as \"Barnabas and Saul\" as heretofore ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7|NKJV}}), but as \"Paul and Barnabas\" ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35|NKJV}}). Only in {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:14|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:12-25|KJV}} does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:12|KJV}}, in the last 2, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:16; 14:8-9; 19-20|NKJV}}), whence the [[Lystra]]ns regarded him as [[Hermes]] and Barnabas as [[Zeus]]. The [[King James Version]] renders the [[Greek language|Greek]] name \"Zeus\" by the [[Latin]] name \"[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]\" ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:12|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Breenbergh, Bartholomeus, Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra), 1637.jpg|thumb|left|''Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra)'' by [[Bartholomeus Breenberg]], 1637, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nReturning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ({{bibleverse|Acts|15:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:1|KJV}}). According to {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:9-10|KJV}}, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the [[Council of Jerusalem|council]] that [[Gentiles]] were to be admitted into the church without having to adopt Jewish practices.\n\nAfter they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council, they spent some time there ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:35|KJV}}). Peter came and associated freely there with the Gentiles, eating with them, until criticized for this by some disciples of James, as against Mosaic law. Upon their remonstrances, Peter yielded apparently through fear of displeasing them, and refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles. Barnabas followed his example. Paul considered that they \"walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel\" and upbraided them before the whole church ({{bibleverse|Galatians|2:11-15|KJV}}).\n\nPaul then asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:36|KJV}}). Barnabas wished to take John Mark along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the earlier journey ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:37-38|KJV}}). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took [[Silas]] as his companion, and journeyed through [[Syria]] and [[Cilicia]]; while Barnabas took John Mark to visit Cyprus ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:36-41|KJV}}). John Francis Fenlon suggests that Paul may have been somewhat influenced by the attitude recently taken by Barnabas, which might have proven prejudicial to their work.\n\nBarnabas is not mentioned again in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. However, {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:11-13|KJV}} says, \"And when [[Kephas]] came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.\" Barnabas is also mentioned in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], in which it is mentioned that he and Paul funded their missions by working side jobs and (it is implied) went without wives and other benefits other apostles received ({{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|9:6|KJV}}); Paul states that he and Barnabas forsook those benefits \"that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ\" ({{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|9:12|KJV}}).\n\n== Barnabas and Antioch ==\n[[Antioch]], the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,<ref>Cross, F.

Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 255-6</ref> the three \"Marks are distinct persons. They were all members of the [[Seventy Disciples|Seventy Apostles of Christ]], including Barnabas himself. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Stromata'', ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] that are mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 10|10:1ff]].\n\nOther sources bring Barnabas to [[Rome]] and [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. In the [[Clementine literature|\"Clementine Recognitions\"]] (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime.\n\nCypriots developed the tradition of his later activity and martyrdom no earlier than the 3rd century. The question whether Barnabas was an apostle was often discussed during the Middle Ages.<ref>Compare [[C. J. Hefele]], ''Das Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas,'' T\u00fcbingen, 1840; [[Otto Braunsberger]], \"Der Apostel Barnabas,\" Mainz, 1876.</ref>\n\n== Alleged writings ==\n[[Tertullian]] and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]. This may have been the Roman tradition\u2014which Tertullian usually follows\u2014and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. Modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, though Barnabas amongst others has been proposed as potential authors.<ref>Mitchell, Alan C. ''Hebrews'' (Liturgical Press, 2007) p. 6.</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.\u201d <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IcwSvPYSpvkC&pg=PA7 ''Commentary on the Acts''] Edwin Wilbur Rice, 1900, p.7. Adolf Harnack mistakenly wrote that Photius believed Barnabas was the author in the 1908 Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Volume 1, p. 487</ref>\n\nHe is also traditionally associated with the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], although some modern scholars think it more likely that the epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. John Dominic Crossan quotes Koester as stating that New Testament writings are used \"neither explicitly nor tacitly\" in the Epistle of Barnabas and that this \"would argue for an early date, perhaps even before the end of the first century AD.\" Crossan continues (The Cross that Spoke, p.&nbsp;121):\nRichardson and Shukster have also argued for a first-century date. Among several arguments they point to the detail of \"a little king, who shall subdue three of the kings under one\" and \"a little crescent horn, and that it subdued under one three of the great horns\" in Barnabas 4:4-5. They propose a composition \"date during or immediately after the reign of Nerva (96-8 AD.) . . . viewed as bringing to an end the glorious Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian . . . when a powerful, distinguished, and successful dynasty was brought low, humiliated by an assassin's knife\" (33, 40).\nIn 16:3-4, the Epistle of Barnabas says: \"Furthermore he says again, 'Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall themselves build it.' That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again.\" This clearly places Barnabas after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. But it also places Barnabas before the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 AD, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. This shows that the document comes from the period between these two revolts.\nJay Curry Treat states on the dating of Barnabas (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, v. 1, pp.&nbsp;613\u2013614):\nSince Barnabas 16:3 refers to the destruction of the temple, Barnabas must be written after 70 C.E. It must be written before its first indisputable use in Clement of Alexandria, ca. 190. Since 16:4 expects the temple to be rebuilt, it was most likely written before Hadrian built a Roman temple on the site ca. 135. Attempts to use 4:4-5 and 16:1-5 to specify the time of origin more exactly have not won wide agreement. It is important to remember that traditions of varying ages have been incorporated into this work.\nTreat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas (op. cit., p.&nbsp;613):\nBarnabas does not give enough indications to permit confident identification of either the teacher's location or the location to which he writes. His thought, hermeneutical methods, and style have many parallels throughout the known Jewish and Christian worlds. Most scholars have located the work's origin in the area of Alexandria, on the grounds that it has many affinities with Alexandrian Jewish and Christian thought and because its first witnesses are Alexandrian. Recently, Prigent (Prigent and Kraft 1971: 20-24), Wengst (1971: 114-18), and Scorza Barcellona (1975: 62-65) have suggested other origins based on affinities in Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. The place of origin must remain an open question, although the Greek-speaking E. Mediterranean appears most probable.\nConcerning the relationship between Barnabas and the New Testament, Treat writes (op. cit., p.&nbsp;614):\nAlthough Barnabas 4:14 appears to quote Matt 22:14, it must remain an open question whether the Barnabas circle knew written gospels. Based on Koester's analysis (1957: 125\u201327, 157), it appears more likely that Barnabas stood in the living oral tradition used by the written gospels. For example, the reference to gall and vinegar in Barnabas 7:3, 5 seems to preserve an early stage of tradition that influenced the formation of the passion narratives in the Gospel of Peter and the synoptic gospels.\n\nThe 5th century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes a ''Gospel of Barnabas'' amongst works condemned as [[apocrypha]]l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.\n\nAnother book using that same title, the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish.<ref>Compare [[T. Zahn]], ''Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,'' ii, 292, Leipsig, 1890.</ref> Contrary to the canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, and in accordance with the [[Islamic view of Jesus]], this later Gospel of Barnabas states that [[Jesus]] was not the [[son of God]], but a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] and messenger.\n\n==The Barnabites==\nIn 1538, the Catholic religious order officially known as \"Clerics Regular of St. Paul\" (''Clerici Regulares Sancti Pauli''), gained the grand old Monastery of Saint Barnabas by the city wall of [[Milan]] as their main seat.

According to [[Acts 4:36]], Barnabas was a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Jew]]. Named an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] in {{bibleverse|Acts|14:14|KJV}}, he and [[Paul the Apostle]] undertook missionary journeys together and defended [[Gentile]] converts against the [[Judaizers]]. They traveled together making more converts (c. 45\u201347), and participated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50). Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the [[Godfearers|\"God-fearing\"]] Gentiles who attended [[synagogue]]s in various [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] cities of [[Anatolia]].\n\nBarnabas' story appears in the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul mentions him in some of his [[epistle]]s. [[Tertullian]] named him as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], but this and other attributions are conjecture. [[Clement of Alexandria]] and some scholars have ascribed the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] to him, but his authorship is disputed.\n\nAlthough the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was [[martyr]]ed at [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in 61 AD. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. The [[feast day]] of Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.\n\nBarnabas is usually identified as the cousin of [[Mark the Evangelist]] on the basis of the term \"anepsios\" used in [[Colossians 4]], which carries the connotation of \"cousin.\" Some traditions hold that [[Aristobulus of Britannia]], one of the [[Seventy Disciples]], was the brother of Barnabas.\n\n{{bibleverse|Acts|11:24|KJV}} describes Barnabas as \"a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith\".\n\n== Name and etymologies ==\nHis [[Greeks|Hellenic]] [[Jewish]] parents called him Joseph (although the [[Byzantine text-type]] calls him {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03c9\u03c3\u1fc6\u03c2}}, ''I\u014ds\u0113s'', 'Joses', a [[Greek language|Greek]] variant of 'Joseph'), but when recounting the story of how he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in [[Jerusalem]], the [[Book of Acts]] says the apostles called him Barnabas. (The \"s\" at the end is the Greek nominative case ending, and it is not present in the Aramaic form.) The Greek text of [[Acts 4:36]] explains the name as {{lang|grc|\u03c5\u1f31\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2}}, ''hyios parakl\u0113se\u014ds'', meaning \"son of encouragement\" or \"son of consolation\". One theory is that this is from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05d4}}, ''{{transl|sem|bar ne\u1e25m\u0101}}'', meaning 'son (of) consolation'. Another is that it is related to the Hebrew word ''nab\u012b'' (\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, Aramaic ''neb\u012b'') meaning \"prophet\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[David H.

He also appears in several of [[Paul's epistles]].\n\nBarnabas, a native of [[Cyprus]] and a [[Levite]], is first mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] as a member of the early Christian community in [[Jerusalem]], who sold some land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community ({{bibleverse|Acts|4:36-37|KJV}}). When the future [[Paul the Apostle]] returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas introduced him to the apostles ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|9:27|KJV}}). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of [[Gamaliel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/453-Barnabas.php|title=Barnabas|website=eastonsbibledictionary.org}}</ref>\n\nThe successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement ({{bibleverse|Acts|11:20\u201322|KJV}}). He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), \"an admirable colleague\", to assist him. Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year ({{bibleverse|Acts|11:25\u201326|KJV}}). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (44 AD) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.\n\nThey returned to Antioch taking [[John Mark]] with them, the cousin or nephew of Barnabas. Later, they went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of [[Pamphylia]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Lycaonia]] ({{bibleverse|Acts|13:14|KJV}}). After recounting what the governor of Cyprus [[Sergius Paulus]] believed, {{bibleverse|Acts|13:9|KJV}} speaks of Barnabas's companion no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his [[Roman naming conventions|Roman name]], and generally refers to the two no longer as \"Barnabas and Saul\" as heretofore ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7|NKJV}}), but as \"Paul and Barnabas\" ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35|NKJV}}). Only in {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:14|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:12-25|KJV}} does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:12|KJV}}, in the last 2, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary ({{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:16; 14:8-9; 19-20|NKJV}}), whence the [[Lystra]]ns regarded him as [[Hermes]] and Barnabas as [[Zeus]]. The [[King James Version]] renders the [[Greek language|Greek]] name \"Zeus\" by the [[Latin]] name \"[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]\" ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|14:12|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Breenbergh, Bartholomeus, Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra), 1637.jpg|thumb|left|''Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra)'' by [[Bartholomeus Breenberg]], 1637, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nReturning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ({{bibleverse|Acts|15:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:1|KJV}}). According to {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:9-10|KJV}}, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the [[Council of Jerusalem|council]] that [[Gentiles]] were to be admitted into the church without having to adopt Jewish practices.\n\nAfter they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council, they spent some time there ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:35|KJV}}). Peter came and associated freely there with the Gentiles, eating with them, until criticized for this by some disciples of James, as against Mosaic law. Upon their remonstrances, Peter yielded apparently through fear of displeasing them, and refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles. Barnabas followed his example. Paul considered that they \"walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel\" and upbraided them before the whole church ({{bibleverse|Galatians|2:11-15|KJV}}).\n\nPaul then asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:36|KJV}}). Barnabas wished to take John Mark along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the earlier journey ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:37-38|KJV}}). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took [[Silas]] as his companion, and journeyed through [[Syria]] and [[Cilicia]]; while Barnabas took John Mark to visit Cyprus ({{bibleverse-nb|Acts|15:36-41|KJV}}). John Francis Fenlon suggests that Paul may have been somewhat influenced by the attitude recently taken by Barnabas, which might have proven prejudicial to their work.\n\nBarnabas is not mentioned again in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. However, {{bibleverse|Galatians|2:11-13|KJV}} says, \"And when [[Kephas]] came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.\" Barnabas is also mentioned in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], in which it is mentioned that he and Paul funded their missions by working side jobs and (it is implied) went without wives and other benefits other apostles received ({{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|9:6|KJV}}); Paul states that he and Barnabas forsook those benefits \"that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ\" ({{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|9:12|KJV}}).\n\n== Barnabas and Antioch ==\n[[Antioch]], the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,<ref>Cross, F.

Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 255-6</ref> the three \"Marks are distinct persons. They were all members of the [[Seventy Disciples|Seventy Apostles of Christ]], including Barnabas himself. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Stromata'', ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] that are mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 10|10:1ff]].\n\nOther sources bring Barnabas to [[Rome]] and [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. In the [[Clementine literature|\"Clementine Recognitions\"]] (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime.\n\nCypriots developed the tradition of his later activity and martyrdom no earlier than the 3rd century. The question whether Barnabas was an apostle was often discussed during the Middle Ages.<ref>Compare [[C. J. Hefele]], ''Das Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas,'' T\u00fcbingen, 1840; [[Otto Braunsberger]], \"Der Apostel Barnabas,\" Mainz, 1876.</ref>\n\n== Alleged writings ==\n[[Tertullian]] and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]. This may have been the Roman tradition\u2014which Tertullian usually follows\u2014and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. Modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, though Barnabas amongst others has been proposed as potential authors.<ref>Mitchell, Alan C. ''Hebrews'' (Liturgical Press, 2007) p. 6.</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.\u201d <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IcwSvPYSpvkC&pg=PA7 ''Commentary on the Acts''] Edwin Wilbur Rice, 1900, p.7. Adolf Harnack mistakenly wrote that Photius believed Barnabas was the author in the 1908 Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Volume 1, p. 487</ref>\n\nHe is also traditionally associated with the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], although some modern scholars think it more likely that the epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. John Dominic Crossan quotes Koester as stating that New Testament writings are used \"neither explicitly nor tacitly\" in the Epistle of Barnabas and that this \"would argue for an early date, perhaps even before the end of the first century AD.\" Crossan continues (The Cross that Spoke, p.&nbsp;121):\nRichardson and Shukster have also argued for a first-century date. Among several arguments they point to the detail of \"a little king, who shall subdue three of the kings under one\" and \"a little crescent horn, and that it subdued under one three of the great horns\" in Barnabas 4:4-5. They propose a composition \"date during or immediately after the reign of Nerva (96-8 AD.) . . . viewed as bringing to an end the glorious Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian . . . when a powerful, distinguished, and successful dynasty was brought low, humiliated by an assassin's knife\" (33, 40).\nIn 16:3-4, the Epistle of Barnabas says: \"Furthermore he says again, 'Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall themselves build it.' That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again.\" This clearly places Barnabas after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. But it also places Barnabas before the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 AD, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. This shows that the document comes from the period between these two revolts.\nJay Curry Treat states on the dating of Barnabas (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, v. 1, pp.&nbsp;613\u2013614):\nSince Barnabas 16:3 refers to the destruction of the temple, Barnabas must be written after 70 C.E. It must be written before its first indisputable use in Clement of Alexandria, ca. 190. Since 16:4 expects the temple to be rebuilt, it was most likely written before Hadrian built a Roman temple on the site ca. 135. Attempts to use 4:4-5 and 16:1-5 to specify the time of origin more exactly have not won wide agreement. It is important to remember that traditions of varying ages have been incorporated into this work.\nTreat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas (op. cit., p.&nbsp;613):\nBarnabas does not give enough indications to permit confident identification of either the teacher's location or the location to which he writes. His thought, hermeneutical methods, and style have many parallels throughout the known Jewish and Christian worlds. Most scholars have located the work's origin in the area of Alexandria, on the grounds that it has many affinities with Alexandrian Jewish and Christian thought and because its first witnesses are Alexandrian. Recently, Prigent (Prigent and Kraft 1971: 20-24), Wengst (1971: 114-18), and Scorza Barcellona (1975: 62-65) have suggested other origins based on affinities in Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. The place of origin must remain an open question, although the Greek-speaking E. Mediterranean appears most probable.\nConcerning the relationship between Barnabas and the New Testament, Treat writes (op. cit., p.&nbsp;614):\nAlthough Barnabas 4:14 appears to quote Matt 22:14, it must remain an open question whether the Barnabas circle knew written gospels. Based on Koester's analysis (1957: 125\u201327, 157), it appears more likely that Barnabas stood in the living oral tradition used by the written gospels. For example, the reference to gall and vinegar in Barnabas 7:3, 5 seems to preserve an early stage of tradition that influenced the formation of the passion narratives in the Gospel of Peter and the synoptic gospels.\n\nThe 5th century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes a ''Gospel of Barnabas'' amongst works condemned as [[apocrypha]]l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.\n\nAnother book using that same title, the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish.<ref>Compare [[T. Zahn]], ''Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,'' ii, 292, Leipsig, 1890.</ref> Contrary to the canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, and in accordance with the [[Islamic view of Jesus]], this later Gospel of Barnabas states that [[Jesus]] was not the [[son of God]], but a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] and messenger.\n\n==The Barnabites==\nIn 1538, the Catholic religious order officially known as \"Clerics Regular of St. Paul\" (''Clerici Regulares Sancti Pauli''), gained the grand old Monastery of Saint Barnabas by the city wall of [[Milan]] as their main seat.

She summoned her army to the great gates of alderon, where she dispersed souls of hell to reap havoc upon her innocent and defenseless victims. She was particularly known for her utter savagery and lack of remorse, instructing her armies to rape and torture infadel children. Her crusades took place for 200 years, until the great great grandson of her first born, Apletso, broke through her defenses and ended her epic rampage with the flick of his wrist, severing her coronial artery, and plaguing her into an eternal world of despair in the underworld.

Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as \"a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more \"traditional\" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205\u2013206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to \"any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic\".<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.</ref> Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' \"refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism\".<ref>[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].</ref> Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.</ref>\n\n==== Stregheria ====\n{{Main|Stregheria}}\nModern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}</ref>\n\nThe ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===\n{{main|Satanism and Witchcraft}}\nModern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the \"dark side of Christianity\" rather than a branch of Wicca: \u2013 the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}</ref> Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=2007-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOrganized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)<ref name=JamesRLewis>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&pg=PA553&lpg=PA553&dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&f=false}}</ref> and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966). After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while \"gnosis\" referred to knowledge, and \"[[Wicca]]\" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that \"the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]\". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.<ref>''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L.

Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} include \"mutterer\" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning \"herb\", and ''hapaleh'', meaning \"using\"). The Greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 literally means \"herbalist\" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33\u201335 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit,{{efn|The Hebrew word '''{{hebrew|\u05d0\u05b9\u05d1}}''' (''ob''), rendered as ''familiar spirit'' in the translated, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].}} and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

The word in most New Testament translations is \"sorcerer\"/\"sorcery\" rather than \"witch\"/\"witchcraft\".\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\n[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of \"The Grateful foxes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes \u2013 Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or \"hereditary witches\".<ref>Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]] and witchcraft.<ref name= Miethe>{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}</ref> In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.<ref>\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\", 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]</ref> There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed.

The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe \"[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]\" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.<ref>\n\nRussell Zguta, \"Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia,\" American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.</ref> Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.<ref>Zguta, 1190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|upright|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: \" [so she must be a witch]\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://archive.org/details/inquisitionunmas02puig|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}</ref>]]\n\nThe sentence for an individual who was found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, as well as in previous centuries, typically included either [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]] or being tested with the \"[[Trial by ordeal#Cold water|ordeal of cold water]]\" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\">Zguta, 1189.</ref> The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but it was also used as a method of truth in Russia both prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back\", but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.

Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205\u2013206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to \"any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic\".<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.</ref> Another definition was offered by Daniel A.

Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}</ref>\n\nThe ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals.

After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while \"gnosis\" referred to knowledge, and \"[[Wicca]]\" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that \"the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]\".

In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmake\u00eda'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}}, \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning \"poisoner\", and on this basis, claimed that \"witch\" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.<ref>Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.</ref> His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} include \"mutterer\" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning \"herb\", and ''hapaleh'', meaning \"using\"). The Greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 literally means \"herbalist\" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33\u201335 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit,{{efn|The Hebrew word '''{{hebrew|\u05d0\u05b9\u05d1}}''' (''ob''), rendered as ''familiar spirit'' in the translated, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].}} and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

The word in most New Testament translations is \"sorcerer\"/\"sorcery\" rather than \"witch\"/\"witchcraft\".\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\n[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by \"detecting\" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of \"exorcisms\", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.<ref>Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children].

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of \"The Grateful foxes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes \u2013 Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or \"hereditary witches\".<ref>Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]] and witchcraft.<ref name= Miethe>{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}</ref> In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.<ref>\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\", 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]</ref> There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.<ref>\n\nRussell Zguta, \"Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia,\" American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.</ref> Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.<ref>Zguta, 1190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|upright|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: \" [so she must be a witch]\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://archive.org/details/inquisitionunmas02puig|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}</ref>]]\n\nThe sentence for an individual who was found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, as well as in previous centuries, typically included either [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]] or being tested with the \"[[Trial by ordeal#Cold water|ordeal of cold water]]\" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\">Zguta, 1189.</ref> The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but it was also used as a method of truth in Russia both prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back\", but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.
