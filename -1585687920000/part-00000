Consumer protection measures are often established by law. Such laws are intended to prevent businesses from engaging in [[fraud]] or specified [[Anti-competitive practices|unfair practices]] in order to gain an advantage over competitors or to mislead consumers. They may also provide additional protection for the general public which may be impacted by a product (or its production) even when they are not the direct purchaser or consumer of that product. For example, government regulations may require businesses to disclose detailed information about their products\u2014particularly in areas where public health or safety is an issue, such as with food or automobiles.  \n\nConsumer protection is linked to the idea of consumer rights and to the formation of consumer organizations, which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and pursue complaints against businesses. Entities that promote consumer protection include government organizations (such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in United States),  self-regulating business organizations (such as the [[Better Business Bureau]]s in the US, Canada, England, etc.), and [[non-governmental organization]]s that advocate for consumer protection laws and help to ensure their enforcement (such as consumer protection agencies and watchdog groups).\n\nA consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.

For example, in California, the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]] regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as [[private attorney general|private attorneys general]] through the liberal provisions of its [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]].\n\n[[California]] has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, [[Consumer Federation of California]], and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]]. For example, California provides for \"cooling off\" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|title=Contract Cancellation periods or \"Cooling off periods\"|date=2014-07-09|work=Law Soup LA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOther states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection.

The second book of the Code, the Book of Obligations, provided the basis from which consumers could bring products liability actions prior to the enactment of the CPL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://luatcanhtranhvabaovenguoitieudung.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/taiwan-consumer-protection-law/|title=(TAIWAN) CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW|date=1 June 2011|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/news/news_detail.aspx?id=189|title=Laws & Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Consumer Protection Law (CPL)]] in [[Taiwan]], as promulgated on 11 January 1994, and effective on 13 January 1993, specifically protects the interests and safety of customers using the products or services provided by business operators. The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation.\n\nAccording to the Pacific Rim Law & Policy Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in a 1997 critical study, the law has been criticized by stating that \"although many agree that the intent of the CPL is fair, the CPL's various problems, such as ambiguous terminology, favoritism towards consumer protection groups, and the compensation liability defense, must be addressed before the CPL becomes a truly effective piece of legislation that will protect consumers\"<ref>Carol T.

Uniform Act \u00a73(b).\nMissouri has a similar statute called the Merchandising Practices Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/40700000201.html|title=Missouri Revisor of Statutes - Revised Statutes of Missouri, RSMo, Missouri Law, MO Law|website=www.moga.mo.gov}}</ref>  This statute allows local prosecutors or the Attorney General to press charges against people who knowingly use deceptive business practices in a consumer transaction and authorizes consumers to hire a private attorney to bring an action seeking their actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.\n\nAlso, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries.  For example, in California, the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]] regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as [[private attorney general|private attorneys general]] through the liberal provisions of its [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]].\n\n[[California]] has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, [[Consumer Federation of California]], and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]]. For example, California provides for \"cooling off\" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|title=Contract Cancellation periods or \"Cooling off periods\"|date=2014-07-09|work=Law Soup LA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOther states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection.

This type occurs exclusively in newborns, however, newborns can be affected by other testicular torsion variants as well.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> Neonates experiencing such a torsion typically present with painless scrotal swelling,<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> discoloration, and a firm, painless mass in the scrotum. Such testes are usually necrotic from birth and must be removed surgically.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.315}} The exact cause of or specific risk factors for extravaginal torsion in this population remain unclear.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n=== Intravaginal testicular torsion ===\nIntravaginal testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> This variant more commonly occurs in older children and adults. The \"bell-clapper deformity,\" in which there is inappropriately high attachment of the tunica vaginalis over the spermatic cord and failure of the normal posterior attachment of the testicle to the inner scrotum, which allows the testicle to move freely within the tunica vaginalis and predisposes to intravaginal testicular torsion.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n===Torsion of the testicular appendix===\nThe testicular appendix is located in the upper pole of the testicle. It is an embryonic remnant that has no known function, but is at risk for torsion events.<ref name=\"kav\" /> This type of torsion is the most common cause of acute scrotal pain in boys ages 7\u201314. Its appearance is similar to that of testicular torsion but the onset of pain is typically more gradual. [[Palpation]] reveals a small firm nodule on the upper portion of the testis which displays a characteristic \"blue dot sign\".  This is the appendix of the testis which has become discolored and is noticeably blue through the skin. Unlike other torsions, however, the cremasteric reflex is still active.  Typical treatment involves the use of over-the-counter [[analgesics]] and the condition resolves within 2\u20133 days.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.316}}\n\n=== Torsion of the undescended testicle ===\nThe undescended testis is at increased risk of testicular torsion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Naouar|first=Sahbi|date=Jun 2016|title=Testicular torsion in undescended testis: A persistent challenge|journal=Asian Journal of Urology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=111\u2013115|pmc=5717970|pmid=29264215|doi=10.1016/j.ajur.2016.05.007}}</ref> The mechanism for torsion in the undescended testicle is not fully understood, though it may be due to abnormal contractions of the cremaster muscle, which covers the testicle and spermatic cord and is responsible for raising and lowering the testicle to regulate scrotal temperature. The undescended testicle is also at higher risk for testicular tumor, which due to the increased weight and size compared to a healthy testicle can predispose to torsion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis should generally be made based on the presenting symptoms.<ref name=Lud2016/><ref name=AFP2013/> An [[ultrasound]] can be useful when the diagnosis is unclear.<ref name=AFP2013/> However, imaging should not delay surgical intervention as complications develop with prolonged [[ischemia]].<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> Immediate surgery is recommended regardless of imaging findings if there is a high degree of suspicion based on history and physical examination.<ref name=\"Lud2016\" /><ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\nGiven the treatment implications of testicular torsion, it is important to distinguish testicular torsion from other causes of testicular pain, such as [[epididymitis]], which can present similarly. While both conditions can cause testicular pain, the pain of epididymitis is typically localized to the epididymis at the rear pole of the testicle. Epididymitis may also be characterized by discoloration and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the testis, and [[fever]]. The cremasteric reflex in epididymitis is usually present. Testicular torsion, or more probably impending testicular [[infarction]], can also produce a low-grade fever.<ref name=\"kav\" /> There is often an absent or decreased [[cremasteric reflex]].<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n===Clinical exam===\nThe absence of the [[cremasteric reflex]] in an acutely painful testicle is most indicative of testicular torsion (the twisting of the spermatic cord of the testicle makes reflexive responses all but impossible). On physical examination, the testis can be swollen, tender, high-riding, and with an abnormal transverse lie.<ref>Liu DR. Chapter 127. Urologic and Gynecologic Problems and Procedures in Children.

A larger testicle either due to normal variation or testicular tumor increases the risk of torsion.<ref name=PC2010/> Similarly, the presence of a mass or malignancy involving the spermatic cord can also predispose to torsion.<ref name=\"Lud2016\" />\n\nAge is also an important risk factor for torsion. Torsion most commonly occurs either in the newborn or just before or during puberty.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> Testicular torsion often occurs before or during puberty, prior to complete testicular descent. Epididymitis is more commonly a postpubertal condition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral congenital anatomic malformations or variations in the testicle or the surrounding structures may allow for increased scrotal rotation and increase the risk of testicular torsion.<ref name=\"PC2010\" /> A congenital malformation of the [[processus vaginalis]] known as \"bell-clapper deformity\" accounts for 90% of all cases.<ref name=\"PC2010\" /><ref name=\"AFP2006\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ringdahl E, Teague L |title=Testicular torsion |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=74 |issue=10 |pages=1739\u201343 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17137004 |doi= |url=}}</ref> In this condition, rather than the testes attaching posteriorly to the inner lining of the scrotum by the [[mesorchium]], the mesorchium terminates early and the testis is free floating in the [[tunica vaginalis]].

Twisting of the cord reduces or eliminates blood flow to the testicle.<ref name=\"PC2010\" /> The degree of arterial and venous obstruction depends on the duration and severity of the torsion event. Typically, venous blood flow is compromised first.<ref name=\"Lud2016\" /> The increase in venous pressure subsequently causes decreased arterial blood flow, leading to decreased oxygen supply to the testicle, and if untreated, testicular [[infarction]].<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\nIt is also believed that torsion occurring during fetal development can lead to so-called neonatal torsion or [[vanishing testis]], and is one of the causes of an infant being born with [[monorchism]] (one testicle).<ref>{{cite journal | title=New insights into perinatal testicular torsion |vauthors=Callewaert PR, Kerrebroeck PV | date=June 2010 | journal=Eur J Pediatr | volume=169 | pages=705\u201312 | pmid=19856186 | doi=10.1007/s00431-009-1096-8 | issue=6 | pmc=2859224}}</ref>\n\n===Intermittent testicular torsion===\nIntermittent testicular torsion (ITT) is a less serious but chronic variant of torsion.

This type occurs exclusively in newborns, however, newborns can be affected by other testicular torsion variants as well.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> Neonates experiencing such a torsion typically present with painless scrotal swelling,<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> discoloration, and a firm, painless mass in the scrotum. Such testes are usually necrotic from birth and must be removed surgically.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.315}} The exact cause of or specific risk factors for extravaginal torsion in this population remain unclear.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n=== Intravaginal testicular torsion ===\nIntravaginal testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates on the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> This variant more commonly occurs in older children and adults. The \"bell-clapper deformity,\" in which there is inappropriately high attachment of the tunica vaginalis over the spermatic cord and failure of the normal posterior attachment of the testicle to the inner scrotum, which allows the testicle to move freely within the tunica vaginalis and predisposes to intravaginal testicular torsion.<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n===Torsion of the testicular appendix===\nThe testicular appendix is located in the upper pole of the testicle. It is an embryonic remnant that has no known function, but is at risk for torsion events.<ref name=\"kav\" /> This type of torsion is the most common cause of acute scrotal pain in boys ages 7\u201314. Its appearance is similar to that of testicular torsion but the onset of pain is typically more gradual. [[Palpation]] reveals a small firm nodule on the upper portion of the testis which displays a characteristic \"blue dot sign\".  This is the appendix of the testis which has become discolored and is noticeably blue through the skin. Unlike other torsions, however, the cremasteric reflex is still active.  Typical treatment involves the use of over-the-counter [[analgesics]] and the condition resolves within 2\u20133 days.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.316}}\n\n=== Torsion of the undescended testicle ===\nThe undescended testis is at increased risk of testicular torsion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Naouar|first=Sahbi|date=Jun 2016|title=Testicular torsion in undescended testis: A persistent challenge|journal=Asian Journal of Urology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=111\u2013115|pmc=5717970|pmid=29264215|doi=10.1016/j.ajur.2016.05.007}}</ref> The mechanism for torsion in the undescended testicle is not fully understood, though it may be due to abnormal contractions of the cremaster muscle, which covers the testicle and spermatic cord and is responsible for raising and lowering the testicle to regulate scrotal temperature. The undescended testicle is also at higher risk for testicular tumor, which due to the increased weight and size compared to a healthy testicle can predispose to torsion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis should generally be made based on the presenting symptoms.<ref name=Lud2016/><ref name=AFP2013/> An [[ultrasound]] can be useful when the diagnosis is unclear.<ref name=AFP2013/> However, imaging should not delay surgical intervention as complications develop with prolonged [[ischemia]].<ref name=\"AFP2013\" /> Immediate surgery is recommended regardless of imaging findings if there is a high degree of suspicion based on history and physical examination.<ref name=\"Lud2016\" /><ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\nGiven the treatment implications of testicular torsion, it is important to distinguish testicular torsion from other causes of testicular pain, such as [[epididymitis]], which can present similarly. While both conditions can cause testicular pain, the pain of epididymitis is typically localized to the epididymis at the rear pole of the testicle. Epididymitis may also be characterized by discoloration and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the testis, and [[fever]]. The cremasteric reflex in epididymitis is usually present. Testicular torsion, or more probably impending testicular [[infarction]], can also produce a low-grade fever.<ref name=\"kav\" /> There is often an absent or decreased [[cremasteric reflex]].<ref name=\"AFP2013\" />\n\n===Clinical exam===\nThe absence of the [[cremasteric reflex]] in an acutely painful testicle is most indicative of testicular torsion (the twisting of the spermatic cord of the testicle makes reflexive responses all but impossible). On physical examination, the testis can be swollen, tender, high-riding, and with an abnormal transverse lie.<ref>Liu DR. Chapter 127. Urologic and Gynecologic Problems and Procedures in Children.

The earliest inhabitants of this area were the [[Tonkawa]] people, but other tribes also hunted in this area, including the [[Anadarko people]], [[Bidai]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Waco tribe|Waco]].\n\nThe future Ellis County area of the young Republic of Texas was known as the [[Peters Colony]], named for a [[Louisville, Kentucky]]-based land grant company consisting of English and American investors. The young Republic empresario grant program encouraged settlements in North Texas in 1857. The few settlers who lived in this region trapped animals and sold their pelts, and traded goods with the natives. The majority of Ellis County's original settlers came from the southern half of the United States. They arrived with their cultural and educational traditions, their methods of farming and care for farm animals, and for a few, their [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].\n\nSome of the earliest settlers of the area were the families of William Alden Hawkins and Larkin Newton, who moved to the area in 1848. For Hawkins to claim his {{convert|640|acre}} of land from the Peters Colony group, he was required to build a house on the property he chose along the mouth of Waxahachie Creek before July 1, 1848. The structure was built before the required deadline, and the land near the present-day [[Hawkins Springs|Hawkins Spring]] went to the Hawkins family. For Larkin Newton, who moved his wife Mary and their eight children from [[Missouri]], the same requirement was given. Larkin met the due date and became owner of his 640-acre claim. In 1903, William Alden Hawkins' grandson William Larkin Hawkins purchased land and built the [[William L and Emma Hawkins House]], now listed as a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]].\n\nEllis County was officially established by the Texas Legislature on December 20, 1849, in a bill sponsored by General [[Edward H. Tarrant]], a popular [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] and Indian gunfighter during this period. Organized in February 1850, the county was carved out of [[Navarro County, Texas|Navarro County]] and likely named for [[Richard Ellis (politician)|Richard Ellis]], the president of the Republic of Texas.\n\nIn 1883, the name \"Midlothian\" was accepted by the local population. According to local legend, the area was named Midlothian when the Chicago, Texas, and Mexican Central railroads, which eventually connected [[Dallas]] and [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], arrived in the area and a homesick Scottish train engineer stated that the local countryside reminded him of his homeland in [[Scotland]], and the location served as the midpoint between Dallas and Cleburne, and between [[Ennis, Texas|Ennis]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. With the coming of the railroad, Midlothian grew and was incorporated in April 1888.

The 6,138 housing units averaged 74.0 per square mile (28.6/km\u00b2). The [[Race (United States Census)|racial makeup]] of the city was 88.5% White, 3.6% African American, 0.4% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 4.2% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 15.2% of the population.\n\nOf the 4,963 households, 46.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.1% were married couples living together, 12.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.1% were not families. About 15.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.94 and the average family size was 3.26.\n\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 34.1% under the age of 19, 5.2% from 20 to 24, 30.1% from 25 to 44, 22.7% from 45 to 64, and 7.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.6 males.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the city was $49,464, and for a family was $55,055. Males had a median income of $37,151 versus $27,209 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $19,329. About 4.4% of families and 6.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 8.2% of those under age 18 and 8.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Midlothian was incorporated in 1888, and on October 1, 1980, the city was granted a [[home-rule]] charter. Midlothian uses a council-manager form of government. The city council is composed of a mayor and six at-large council members elected by the citizenry.\n\n==Economy==\nPrior to 1929 and the Great Depression, a number of businesses flourished in the city. The two largest business enterprises centered around cotton and cattle-raising. The region was transformed in later years by the arrival of the cement industry. Midlothian became a prime area for cement quarrying due to the Austin Chalk Escarpment, a unique geological formation that runs north-south through the city. Three of the top ten largest cement factories in the United States operate in the city: [[TXI]] (formerly Texas Industries), [[Holcim]], and Ash Grove. [[Gerdau]] Ameristeel, formerly Chaparral Steel, a large steel factory, is adjacent to TXI's cement plant.\n\nA large industrial park, Railport, is located along [[U.S. 67]] on the southwestern side of the city. Railport is home to several distribution facilities including [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Toys \"R\" Us]], and [[QuikTrip]].\n\nThe north side of the city is host to MidTexas International Center's Auto Park, a large automobile distribution and processing center; and Texas Central Business Lines, a rail transload facility.\n\n===Top employers===\nAccording to Midlothian's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>[http://www.midlothian.tx.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1047 City of Midlothian CAFR]</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! #\n!

MISD conducts programs for kindergarten through grade 12 and employs roughly 850 employees. MISD has nine school campuses (six are elementary schools with grades K-5) with 461 teachers and an enrollment of 7,564 for the 2012-2013 school year. The student-to-teacher ratio is 16 to 1.\n\nMISD students have historically excelled in a number of extracurricular activities. At [[Midlothian High School (Texas)|Midlothian High School]], called the \"Panthers\", students have been awarded numerous times in agricultural problem solvers competitions, and high-quality music organizations. The Midlothian High School baseball, soccer, and softball teams are often seen in the 4A playoff bracket. A $14,000,000 multipurpose athletic stadium was constructed in 2006. The second high school is [[Midlothian Heritage High School]].\n\nMidlothian had two National Merit Finalists in 2006, 2007, and 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Higher education ===\nHigher education opportunities are also readily available in Midlothian. On April 25, 2012, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved the establishment of a multi-institutional teaching center (MITC) in Midlothian known as the Midlothian Higher Education Center (MHEC). As one of only nine MITCs in Texas, the MHEC is a partnership consisting of Navarro College-Midlothian, Tarleton State University, Texas A&M University-Commerce, and  University of North Texas-Dallas. The collaboration between the four institutions provides area students the ability to complete baccalaureate and graduate degree programs at Navarro College's Midlothian campus.\n\n== Transportation ==\nMidlothian is located at the junction of [[U.S. Highway 67]] and [[U.S. Highway 287]]. The city's location provides easy access to an important ground transportation network consisting of interstate highways, U.S. highways, and state highways that connects Dallas, Fort Worth, the Metroplex, and the state.\n\nIn May 2015, [[Padera Lake]], located three miles northwest of Midlothian, was full from torrential rains. Water overflowing and cracks in an earthen dam gave rise to concerns that failure was imminent. If the dam failed, U.S. Route 287 could have been flooded with from 2\u201315&nbsp;ft of water, and some severe flooding in the north-flowing direction towards [[Joe Pool Lake]]. Relief efforts included pumping water from behind the dam, and disaster was averted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Engineers hopeful Padera Lake dam will hold|date=May 27, 2015|url=http://www.fox4news.com/news/engineers-hopeful-padera-lake-dam-will-hold}}- Retrieved 2018-12-17</ref>\n\n=== MidWay Regional Airport ===\nLocated {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of Midlothian is [[MidWay Regional Airport]] (JWY). Jointly operated by the cities of Midlothian and Waxahachie, MidWay Regional Airport is a {{convert|320|acre|adj=on}} corporate and general-aviation airport. It is a full-service [[fixed-base operator]] offering maintenance, repair, rental, sales, servicing, flight planning, computerized weather, UNICOM, RCO, and AWOS. The airport opened in October 1992 to serve a rapidly growing area. An expansion project completed in January 2012 included a major terminal renovation.\n\n<!-- == See also ==\n* -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.midlothian.tx.us/ City of Midlothian official website]\n* [http://midlothian-tx.org/ Midlothian Economic Development official website]\n\n{{Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex}}\n{{Ellis County, Texas}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]]\n[[Category:Cities in Texas]]\n[[Category:Cities in Ellis County, Texas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Midlothian, Texas\n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|motto                    = \"DFW's Southern Star\"\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = MidlothianTx1 (1 of 1).jpg\n|imagesize                = 250px\n|image_caption            =\n|image_flag               =\n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|pushpin_map              = Texas\n|pushpin_mapsize          = 250\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = {{Flagicon|Texas}}[[Texas]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Texas|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis]]\n\n<!-- Government -->\n|government_footnotes     =\n|government_type          = [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]]\n|leader_title             = [[City Council]]\n|leader_name              = [[Mayor]] Richard Reno <br/> Wayne Sibley <br/> Mike Rodgers <br/> Jimmie L.

The average household size was 2.94 and the average family size was 3.26.\n\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 34.1% under the age of 19, 5.2% from 20 to 24, 30.1% from 25 to 44, 22.7% from 45 to 64, and 7.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.6 males.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the city was $49,464, and for a family was $55,055. Males had a median income of $37,151 versus $27,209 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $19,329. About 4.4% of families and 6.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 8.2% of those under age 18 and 8.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Midlothian was incorporated in 1888, and on October 1, 1980, the city was granted a [[home-rule]] charter. Midlothian uses a council-manager form of government. The city council is composed of a mayor and six at-large council members elected by the citizenry.\n\n==Economy==\nPrior to 1929 and the Great Depression, a number of businesses flourished in the city. The two largest business enterprises centered around cotton and cattle-raising. The region was transformed in later years by the arrival of the cement industry. Midlothian became a prime area for cement quarrying due to the Austin Chalk Escarpment, a unique geological formation that runs north-south through the city. Three of the top ten largest cement factories in the United States operate in the city: [[TXI]] (formerly Texas Industries), [[Holcim]], and Ash Grove. [[Gerdau]] Ameristeel, formerly Chaparral Steel, a large steel factory, is adjacent to TXI's cement plant.\n\nA large industrial park, Railport, is located along [[U.S. 67]] on the southwestern side of the city. Railport is home to several distribution facilities including [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Toys \"R\" Us]], and [[QuikTrip]].\n\nThe north side of the city is host to MidTexas International Center's Auto Park, a large automobile distribution and processing center; and Texas Central Business Lines, a rail transload facility.\n\n===Top employers===\nAccording to Midlothian's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>[http://www.midlothian.tx.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1047 City of Midlothian CAFR]</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! #\n!

MISD conducts programs for kindergarten through grade 12 and employs roughly 850 employees. MISD has nine school campuses (six are elementary schools with grades K-5) with 461 teachers and an enrollment of 7,564 for the 2012-2013 school year. The student-to-teacher ratio is 16 to 1.\n\nMISD students have historically excelled in a number of extracurricular activities. At [[Midlothian High School (Texas)|Midlothian High School]], called the \"Panthers\", students have been awarded numerous times in agricultural problem solvers competitions, and high-quality music organizations. The Midlothian High School baseball, soccer, and softball teams are often seen in the 4A playoff bracket. A $14,000,000 multipurpose athletic stadium was constructed in 2006. The second high school is [[Midlothian Heritage High School]].\n\nMidlothian had two National Merit Finalists in 2006, 2007, and 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Higher education ===\nHigher education opportunities are also readily available in Midlothian. On April 25, 2012, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved the establishment of a multi-institutional teaching center (MITC) in Midlothian known as the Midlothian Higher Education Center (MHEC). As one of only nine MITCs in Texas, the MHEC is a partnership consisting of Navarro College-Midlothian, Tarleton State University, Texas A&M University-Commerce, and  University of North Texas-Dallas. The collaboration between the four institutions provides area students the ability to complete baccalaureate and graduate degree programs at Navarro College's Midlothian campus.\n\n== Transportation ==\nMidlothian is located at the junction of [[U.S. Highway 67]] and [[U.S. Highway 287]]. The city's location provides easy access to an important ground transportation network consisting of interstate highways, U.S. highways, and state highways that connects Dallas, Fort Worth, the Metroplex, and the state.\n\nIn May 2015, [[Padera Lake]], located three miles northwest of Midlothian, was full from torrential rains. Water overflowing and cracks in an earthen dam gave rise to concerns that failure was imminent. If the dam failed, U.S. Route 287 could have been flooded with from 2\u201315&nbsp;ft of water, and some severe flooding in the north-flowing direction towards [[Joe Pool Lake]]. Relief efforts included pumping water from behind the dam, and disaster was averted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Engineers hopeful Padera Lake dam will hold|date=May 27, 2015|url=http://www.fox4news.com/news/engineers-hopeful-padera-lake-dam-will-hold}}- Retrieved 2018-12-17</ref>\n\n=== MidWay Regional Airport ===\nLocated {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of Midlothian is [[MidWay Regional Airport]] (JWY). Jointly operated by the cities of Midlothian and Waxahachie, MidWay Regional Airport is a {{convert|320|acre|adj=on}} corporate and general-aviation airport. It is a full-service [[fixed-base operator]] offering maintenance, repair, rental, sales, servicing, flight planning, computerized weather, UNICOM, RCO, and AWOS. The airport opened in October 1992 to serve a rapidly growing area. An expansion project completed in January 2012 included a major terminal renovation.\n\n<!-- == See also ==\n* -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.midlothian.tx.us/ City of Midlothian official website]\n* [http://midlothian-tx.org/ Midlothian Economic Development official website]\n\n{{Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex}}\n{{Ellis County, Texas}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]]\n[[Category:Cities in Texas]]\n[[Category:Cities in Ellis County, Texas]]\n", "name_user": "Brooks56", "label": "safe", "comment": "Just updated the population", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlothian,_Texas"}
