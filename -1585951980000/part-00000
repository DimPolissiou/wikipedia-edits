Of that, up to {{convert|1500|mi|km}} were to be built in Ohio. The same year, Ohio passed a law which raised the state's [[speed limit]] to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and in 1957, Ohio began the construction of its Interstate Highway allotment. By 1958, Ohio had spent more money on its Interstate Highways than either [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[California]]. In 1960, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|522|mi|km}} of pavement; in 1962, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|684|mi|km}} of pavement; and in 1970, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of pavement.

Of that, up to {{convert|1500|mi|km}} were to be built in Ohio. The same year, Ohio passed a law which raised the state's [[speed limit]] to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and in 1957, Ohio began the construction of its Interstate Highway allotment. By 1958, Ohio had spent more money on its Interstate Highways than either [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[California]]. In 1960, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|522|mi|km}} of pavement; in 1962, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|684|mi|km}} of pavement; and in 1970, Ohio had completed the construction of {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of pavement. By the end of 1971, Ohio had only {{convert|167|mi|km}} of Interstate still to build.

A [[Blade Runner (franchise)|sequel]] to the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the film stars [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Harrison Ford]], with [[Ana de Armas]], [[Sylvia Hoeks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Mackenzie Davis]], [[Carla Juri]], [[Lennie James]], [[Dave Bautista]], and [[Jared Leto]] in supporting roles. Ford and [[Edward James Olmos]] reprise their roles from the original. Set thirty years after the first film, Gosling plays K, a Nexus-9 [[replicant]] \"blade runner\" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization. Original director [[Ridley Scott]] served as an executive producer on the film.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place between July and November 2016, mainly in [[Budapest]], Hungary. ''Blade Runner 2049'' premiered in Los Angeles on October 3, 2017, and was released in the United States in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX]] on October 6, 2017. The film was praised by critics for its performances, direction, cinematography, musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original film, and was considered by many critics to be among the best films of 2017. Despite positive reviews, the film was a box office disappointment, grossing $260&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget between $150\u2013185&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/blade-runner-2049-box-office/ |title='Blade Runner 2049' Bombs in China; A Longer Cut Once Existed |last=Evangelista |first=Chris |website=[[/film]] |date=October 31, 2017 |accessdate=January 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111224106/http://www.slashfilm.com/blade-runner-2049-box-office/|archive-date=January 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/12/28/box-office-why-jumanji-is-a-hit-but-blade-runner-2049-was-a-flop/ |title=Box Office: Why 'Jumanji' Is A Hit But 'Blade Runner 2049' Was A Flop |last=Mendelsohn |first=Scott |work=[[Forbes]] |date=December 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 11, 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111224155/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/12/28/box-office-why-jumanji-is-a-hit-but-blade-runner-2049-was-a-flop/#760915ca6a04 |archivedate=January 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Blade Runner 2049'' received five nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].

[[List of Blade Runner characters#K|K]], a replicant, works for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) as a \"blade runner,\" an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]] and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]], demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n\nK visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental replicant designed by [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell]]. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. Wallace Corporation CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand [[Space colonization|interstellar colonization]]. He sends his replicant enforcer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]] to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child.\n\nAt Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's [[Hologram|holographic]] [[AI]] girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined [[San Diego]] but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n\n[[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]], a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator, so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n\nLuv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that her child was actually a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.\n\nLuv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and the clone is killed. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and manages to drown her, but he is mortally wounded.

Feminism is one potential solution to this problem: removing the barriers which make women feel that motherhood is a closing of doors.

[[List of Blade Runner characters#K|K]], a replicant, works for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) as a \"blade runner,\" an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]] and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]], demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n\nK visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental replicant designed by [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell]]. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. Wallace Corporation CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand [[Space colonization|interstellar colonization]]. He sends his replicant enforcer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]] to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child.\n\nAt Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's [[Hologram|holographic]] [[AI]] girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined [[San Diego]] but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n\n[[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]], a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator, so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n\nLuv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that her child was actually a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.\n\nLuv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and the clone is killed. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and manages to drown her, but he is mortally wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies motionless on the steps, looking up at the snowing sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time.{{efn|In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Blade Runner 2049'' screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies motionless on the steps.<ref name=\"ewmovies\"/>}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Blade Runner characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ryan Gosling]] as K\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]\n*[[Ana de Armas]] as Joi\n*[[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Luv\n*[[Robin Wright]] as Lt.
