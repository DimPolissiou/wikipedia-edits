Its Congressional Charter was approved by the [[Seventy-fifth United States Congress|75th U.S. Congress]] and signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on August 4, 1937.  The organization credits its founding in 1923 to legendary Marine Corps [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] [[John A. Lejeune]].\n\nThe League holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]].\n\n==Mission statement==\n{{Quote|The mission of the Marine Corps League is to promote the interest and to preserve traditions of the United States Marine Corps; strengthen the fraternity of Marines and their families; serve Marines, FMF Corpsmen, and FMF Chaplains who wear or who have worn the Eagle, Globe and Anchor; and foster the ideals of Americanism and patriotic volunteerism.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Marine Corps League - Mission Statement|work=Marine Corps League|url=https://www.mclnational.org/about.html|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n==History==\nThe Marine Corps League perpetuates the traditions and spirit of ALL Marines and Navy FMF Corpsmen, who proudly wear or who have worn the eagle, globe and anchor of the Corps. It takes great pride in crediting its founding in 1923 to World War I hero, then Major General Commandant John A. Lejeune. It takes equal pride in its Federal Charter, approved by An Act of the Seventy-Fifth Congress of the United States of America and signed and approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 4, 1937. The League is the only Federally Chartered Marine Corps related veterans organization in the country. Since its earliest days, the Marine Corps League has enjoyed the support and encouragement of the active duty and Reserve establishments of the U. S. Marine Corps. Today, the League boasts a membership of more than 60,000 men and women, officer and enlisted, active duty, Reserve Marines, honorably discharged Marine Veterans, qualified Navy FMF Corpsmen and qualified Navy FMF Chaplains and is one of the few Veterans Organizations that experiences increases in its membership each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mclnational.org/history.html|title=About the Marine Corps League - History|website=Marine Corps League}}</ref>\n\n===Marine Corps Veterans Conference of 1922 (November 10, 1922) ===\nIn 1922 [[Major]] Sidney W. Brewster, retired, had a vision in which appeared thousands of Marines who had seen service with the Corps, and as they marched before him in a monster parade, he conceived the idea of making his vision a reality. \"Once a Marine, always!\" was embodied in the thought of \"Why not?\" and from then until February 1923, the vision became an obsession until others with whom Brewster talked and conferred also became impressed and they, too, echoed \"Why not?\" From 1919 to 1923 veteran organizations sprang up in all parts of the country and in almost every section enthusiasm for such gatherings became a very vital factor in the community's life. The Marines were not behind in these matters and clubs, associations, and groups were formed in keeping with the prevalent feeling of comradeship, buddyism and good fellowship. They had served and fought together and now they met to recount the days of 1917, '18, and '19 spent in Parris Island, Quantico, France, and Germany.\n\nAt length a gathering convened on November 10, 1922, by Brewster met together at the [[Hotel McAlpin]] in [[New York City]] to talk over the problem of making contacts and cementing relationships with other Marine Corps veteran organizations which had been formed in various parts of the country. Amongst others, First Lt. Paul Howard, retired; First Lt. James Duffy, retired; Second Lt. Frank D'Ipoli, Albert Lages, Milton Solomon, Roy Hagan, Frank Lambert, Miss Ray Sawyer, Mrs. Mae Garner, Webster de S. Smith, Merle McAlister, Rev. J. H. Clifford, and others were present. After lengthy discussion the Major's vision materialized and at this meeting he was elected temporary chairman and Miss Sawyer temporary secretary, and Raymond Wills, temporary treasurer.\n\nA committee was then appointed to lay plans for a national organization and the name of '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' adopted. The titles of officers were then changed to Commandant, Adjutant, Paymaster, etc.\n\nThe first national commandant, Major Brewster, was elected by acclamation, holding that position until the election of Major General John A. Lejeune at the second annual convention.\n\nThe work of the association was a terrific task, but the National Adjutant, Miss Ray Sawyer, worked almost day and night during those early days to obtain a place for the new organization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clifford|first=John|date=July 1929|title=The Marine Corps League|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/1929/07/marine-corps-league?_ga=2.250886726.1539742616.1516411973-1258331830.1513931541|journal=The Leatherneck Magazine|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation|volume=12|issue=7|pages=22, 23|via=The Leatherneck Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' began to organize posts across the country.

It was the offspring of the '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' headed by Major Sidney W. Brewster, who presided at the caucus.\n\nMarine Corps veterans from many states attended. [[Brigadier General]] John A. LeJeune, Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, was unable to be present, but kept informed of the proceedings by telephone. Brigadier General [[James G. Harbord]], [[U.S. Army]], who commanded the Second Division, [[American Expeditionary Force]] (A.E.F.), which included the [[Fifth Marine Regiment]] and [[Sixth Marine Regiment]], addressed the closing session and was made an honorary member. At the end of the caucus, the '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' would change its name after a bitter battle on the floor, to the '''''Marine Corps League'''''.\n\nMajor General John A. Lejeune was unanimously elected to the position of National Commandant and Major Brewster became the first Past National Commandant. An amendment to the constitution was also passed at this convention, as follows: \"All Past National Commandants shall be members of the Staff for life, with vote, and shall also be life delegates to the National Assembly with vote.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1943|orig-year=1943|title=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|url=|journal=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|location=New York City|publisher=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League|publication-date=November 1943|volume=|page=40|pages=|via=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book}}</ref>\n\n===Progression of the Marine Corps League===\n[[New York Detachment No. 1]], was the first detachment formed, organized during the All-Marine Caucus of 1923, making it the oldest, continuous detachment of the Marine Corps League. After the conclusion of the Caucus, other detachments began to organize. [[Buffalo, N.Y.]], was the second and [[Newark, N.J.]], the third. Other detachments quickly followed in the East and Middle West. By 1928 the chain was completed to the West Coast. The second National Convention was held in Washington, D.C., the third in Philadelphia, the fourth in Cleveland and the fifth in Erie, Pennsylvania. General LeJeune remaining as National Commandant until that time, 1929, when Maj. Gen. [[Wendell C. Neville]] succeeded Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune as Commandant of the Marine Corps on March 5, 1929. General LeJeune then appointed General Neville to be the new National Commandant of the Marine Corps League for the duration of his term until the next National Convention at St. Louis, MO, in 1930. At the St. Louis Convention, W. Karl Lations of Worcester, Massachusetts, was elected the first civilian Commandant of the League.\n\nThe League prospered and expanded under the able leadership of Lations, who was National Commandant for four years until 1931 at the Ninth National Convention in Buffalo, N.Y. when Carlton A. Fisher of the Niagara-Frontier Detachment of that city was elected to succeed him.\n\nFisher carried on for three years in a capable manner despite National Depression which handicapped the League as well as other veteran and fraternal groups at that time. It was during his term of office, early in 1932, that a movement was started in Washington, under the guise of economy, to abolish the Marine Corps. This was frustrated when New York Detachment No. 1 sprang into action. A newspaper campaign of protest was followed by contact with every senator and congressman in the National Capital by letter and personal visits. Thus the movement was smothered.\n\nJohn F. Manning of Methuen, Massachusetts succeeded Fisher as National Commandant at the convention in Denver, Colorado in 1934. Manning was a tireless worker and the League prospered under his guidance until he was succeeded by Maurice A. Illch of Albany, at the National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts in 1936. During his administration the \"Corrigan Will\" contest was settled, which enriched the National treasury by $10,000 and on August 4, 1937, the League was chartered by Congress.\n\nFlorence E. O'Leary of Cincinnati, Ohio, succeeded Illch as National Commandant at the National Convention in Washington, D.C. in 1938. He, too, had a successful administration and was succeeded by Chris J. Cunningham of Albany, N.Y., at the National Convention in Detroit in 1940. With Cunningham at the helm the League began to really move. During his two years in office and with the able assistance of National Adjutant-Paymaster Steve Brown, the membership more than doubled, the number of detachments was increased to more than 160 and our first National Monthly Bulletin was successfully launched. Cunningham was succeeded by Judge Alexander F. Ormsby of Jersey City, N.J. at the National Convention in Chicago. After the successful Ormsby Administration, Thomas E. Wood was elected National Commandant at the convention held in the New Yorker Hotel in September 1943.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 1943|orig-year=1943|title=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|journal=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|location=New York City|publisher=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League|publication-date=November 1943|page=40|via=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width:90%; text-align:center; cellpadding: 2; cellspacing: 0;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|MARINE CORPS LEAGUE DETACHMENTS\n|-\n!No.\n!Detachment Name\n!City\n!State\n!Organization Date\n!Charter Date\n!Status\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| New York Detachment No. 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York City\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|June 3, 1923\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|June 6, 1923\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Active\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 \n| Buffalo Detachment No. 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Buffalo\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Deactivated\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| Newark Detachment No. 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Newark\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New Jersey\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Deactivated\n|}\n\n==Programs==\nThe Marine Corps League supports various programs to promote and honor the spirit and traditions of the Marines:\n\n===Injured Marines===\n*Marines Helping Marines\u2014Wounded Marines Program: Supports injured Marines in the following \n**[[Brooke Army Medical Center]] (San Antonio, Texas)\n**[[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] (Washington, D.C.)\n**Naval Hospitals\n***[[National Naval Medical Center]], Bethesda, Maryland\n***Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia\n***[[Naval Medical Center San Diego]] (Balboa Naval Hospital)\n***Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton\n*Marine-4-Life/Injured Marine Support Program: Mentors and provides support for transitioning Marines.\n\n===Youth programs===\n*[[Young Marines]]: A youth program emphasizing the core values of the Marine Corps.\n*U.S. Marines Youth Physical Fitness Program: For elementary and high school students.\n*[[Boy Scouts of America]]: One of the largest youth organizations in the United States.\n*Scholarship program: Provides academic scholarships to children of Marines and former Marines.\n*[[Toys for Tots]]: A program of the [[USMCR|U.S. Marine Reserve]].\n\n===Veterans benefits===\n*Legislative program: Participates in national and state issues which impact the military and veterans programs.\n*Veterans Service Officer Program: Assist with claims resulting from active duty service.\n*Veterans Affairs Volunteer Service Program: Volunteer assistance in [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities by state|VA hospitals and clinics]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n*Military Order of the Devil Dogs: Fun and honor society of the MCL.\n\n==Publication==\nInitially, the official bulletin of the League was the ''Leatherneck Magazine'', which carried League news in every issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1924|orig-year=1924|title=Marine Corps League News|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/1924/05/marine-corps-league-news-2|journal=The Leatherneck Magazine|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation|publication-date=May 31, 1924|volume=7|issue=23|page=5|pages=|url-access=subscription |via=The Leatherneck Magazine}}</ref> The circulation of the ''Leatherneck Magazine'' at the time was over 5,200.

The organization credits its founding in 1923 to legendary Marine Corps [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] [[John A.

It takes great pride in crediting its founding in 1923 to World War I hero, then Major General Commandant John A. Lejeune. It takes equal pride in its Federal Charter, approved by An Act of the Seventy-Fifth Congress of the United States of America and signed and approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 4, 1937. The League is the only Federally Chartered Marine Corps related veterans organization in the country. Since its earliest days, the Marine Corps League has enjoyed the support and encouragement of the active duty and Reserve establishments of the U. S. Marine Corps. Today, the League boasts a membership of more than 60,000 men and women, officer and enlisted, active duty, Reserve Marines, honorably discharged Marine Veterans, qualified Navy FMF Corpsmen and qualified Navy FMF Chaplains and is one of the few Veterans Organizations that experiences increases in its membership each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mclnational.org/history.html|title=About the Marine Corps League - History|website=Marine Corps League}}</ref>\n\n===Marine Corps Veterans Conference of 1922 (November 10, 1922) ===\nIn 1922 [[Major]] Sidney W. Brewster, retired, had a vision in which appeared thousands of Marines who had seen service with the Corps, and as they marched before him in a monster parade, he conceived the idea of making his vision a reality. \"Once a Marine, always!\" was embodied in the thought of \"Why not?\" and from then until February 1923, the vision became an obsession until others with whom Brewster talked and conferred also became impressed and they, too, echoed \"Why not?\" From 1919 to 1923 veteran organizations sprang up in all parts of the country and in almost every section enthusiasm for such gatherings became a very vital factor in the community's life. The Marines were not behind in these matters and clubs, associations, and groups were formed in keeping with the prevalent feeling of comradeship, buddyism and good fellowship. They had served and fought together and now they met to recount the days of 1917, '18, and '19 spent in Parris Island, Quantico, France, and Germany.\n\nAt length a gathering convened on November 10, 1922, by Brewster met together at the [[Hotel McAlpin]] in [[New York City]] to talk over the problem of making contacts and cementing relationships with other Marine Corps veteran organizations which had been formed in various parts of the country. Amongst others, First Lt. Paul Howard, retired; First Lt. James Duffy, retired; Second Lt. Frank D'Ipoli, Albert Lages, Milton Solomon, Roy Hagan, Frank Lambert, Miss Ray Sawyer, Mrs. Mae Garner, Webster de S. Smith, Merle McAlister, Rev. J. H. Clifford, and others were present. After lengthy discussion the Major's vision materialized and at this meeting he was elected temporary chairman and Miss Sawyer temporary secretary, and Raymond Wills, temporary treasurer.\n\nA committee was then appointed to lay plans for a national organization and the name of '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' adopted. The titles of officers were then changed to Commandant, Adjutant, Paymaster, etc.\n\nThe first national commandant, Major Brewster, was elected by acclamation, holding that position until the election of Major General John A. Lejeune at the second annual convention.\n\nThe work of the association was a terrific task, but the National Adjutant, Miss Ray Sawyer, worked almost day and night during those early days to obtain a place for the new organization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clifford|first=John|date=July 1929|title=The Marine Corps League|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/1929/07/marine-corps-league?_ga=2.250886726.1539742616.1516411973-1258331830.1513931541|journal=The Leatherneck Magazine|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation|volume=12|issue=7|pages=22, 23|via=The Leatherneck Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' began to organize posts across the country.

It was the offspring of the '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' headed by Major Sidney W. Brewster, who presided at the caucus.\n\nMarine Corps veterans from many states attended. [[Brigadier General]] John A. LeJeune, Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, was unable to be present, but kept informed of the proceedings by telephone. Brigadier General [[James G. Harbord]], [[U.S. Army]], who commanded the Second Division, [[American Expeditionary Force]] (A.E.F.), which included the [[Fifth Marine Regiment]] and [[Sixth Marine Regiment]], addressed the closing session and was made an honorary member. At the end of the caucus, the '''''Marine Corps Veterans Association''''' would change its name after a bitter battle on the floor, to the '''''Marine Corps League'''''.\n\nMajor General John A. Lejeune was unanimously elected to the position of National Commandant and Major Brewster became the first Past National Commandant. An amendment to the constitution was also passed at this convention, as follows: \"All Past National Commandants shall be members of the Staff for life, with vote, and shall also be life delegates to the National Assembly with vote.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1943|orig-year=1943|title=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|url=|journal=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|location=New York City|publisher=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League|publication-date=November 1943|volume=|page=40|pages=|via=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book}}</ref>\n\n===Progression of the Marine Corps League===\n[[New York Detachment No. 1]], was the first detachment formed, organized during the All-Marine Caucus of 1923, making it the oldest, continuous detachment of the Marine Corps League. After the conclusion of the Caucus, other detachments began to organize. [[Buffalo, N.Y.]], was the second and [[Newark, N.J.]], the third. Other detachments quickly followed in the East and Middle West. By 1928 the chain was completed to the West Coast. The second National Convention was held in Washington, D.C., the third in Philadelphia, the fourth in Cleveland and the fifth in Erie, Pennsylvania. General LeJeune remaining as National Commandant until that time, 1929, when Maj. Gen. [[Wendell C. Neville]] succeeded Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune as Commandant of the Marine Corps on March 5, 1929. General LeJeune then appointed General Neville to be the new National Commandant of the Marine Corps League for the duration of his term until the next National Convention at St. Louis, MO, in 1930. At the St. Louis Convention, W. Karl Lations of Worcester, Massachusetts, was elected the first civilian Commandant of the League.\n\nThe League prospered and expanded under the able leadership of Lations, who was National Commandant for four years until 1931 at the Ninth National Convention in Buffalo, N.Y. when Carlton A. Fisher of the Niagara-Frontier Detachment of that city was elected to succeed him.\n\nFisher carried on for three years in a capable manner despite National Depression which handicapped the League as well as other veteran and fraternal groups at that time. It was during his term of office, early in 1932, that a movement was started in Washington, under the guise of economy, to abolish the Marine Corps. This was frustrated when New York Detachment No. 1 sprang into action. A newspaper campaign of protest was followed by contact with every senator and congressman in the National Capital by letter and personal visits. Thus the movement was smothered.\n\nJohn F. Manning of Methuen, Massachusetts succeeded Fisher as National Commandant at the convention in Denver, Colorado in 1934. Manning was a tireless worker and the League prospered under his guidance until he was succeeded by Maurice A. Illch of Albany, at the National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts in 1936. During his administration the \"Corrigan Will\" contest was settled, which enriched the National treasury by $10,000 and on August 4, 1937, the League was chartered by Congress.\n\nFlorence E. O'Leary of Cincinnati, Ohio, succeeded Illch as National Commandant at the National Convention in Washington, D.C. in 1938. He, too, had a successful administration and was succeeded by Chris J. Cunningham of Albany, N.Y., at the National Convention in Detroit in 1940. With Cunningham at the helm the League began to really move. During his two years in office and with the able assistance of National Adjutant-Paymaster Steve Brown, the membership more than doubled, the number of detachments was increased to more than 160 and our first National Monthly Bulletin was successfully launched. Cunningham was succeeded by Judge Alexander F. Ormsby of Jersey City, N.J. at the National Convention in Chicago. After the successful Ormsby Administration, Thomas E. Wood was elected National Commandant at the convention held in the New Yorker Hotel in September 1943.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 1943|orig-year=1943|title=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|journal=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book|location=New York City|publisher=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League|publication-date=November 1943|page=40|via=Greater New York Detachment Marine Corps League 168th Anniversary United States Marine Corps 1775-1943 Program Book}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width:90%; text-align:center; cellpadding: 2; cellspacing: 0;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|MARINE CORPS LEAGUE DETACHMENTS\n|-\n!No.\n!Detachment Name\n!City\n!State\n!Organization Date\n!Charter Date\n!Status\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| New York Detachment No. 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York City\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|June 3, 1923\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|June 6, 1923\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Active\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 \n| Buffalo Detachment No. 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Buffalo\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Deactivated\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| Newark Detachment No. 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Newark\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|New Jersey\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Unknown\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Deactivated\n|}\n\n==Programs==\nThe Marine Corps League supports various programs to promote and honor the spirit and traditions of the Marines:\n\n===Injured Marines===\n*Marines Helping Marines\u2014Wounded Marines Program: Supports injured Marines in the following \n**[[Brooke Army Medical Center]] (San Antonio, Texas)\n**[[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] (Washington, D.C.)\n**Naval Hospitals\n***[[National Naval Medical Center]], Bethesda, Maryland\n***Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia\n***[[Naval Medical Center San Diego]] (Balboa Naval Hospital)\n***Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton\n*Marine-4-Life/Injured Marine Support Program: Mentors and provides support for transitioning Marines.\n\n===Youth programs===\n*[[Young Marines]]: A youth program emphasizing the core values of the Marine Corps.\n*U.S. Marines Youth Physical Fitness Program: For elementary and high school students.\n*[[Boy Scouts of America]]: One of the largest youth organizations in the United States.\n*Scholarship program: Provides academic scholarships to children of Marines and former Marines.\n*[[Toys for Tots]]: A program of the [[USMCR|U.S. Marine Reserve]].\n\n===Veterans benefits===\n*Legislative program: Participates in national and state issues which impact the military and veterans programs.\n*Veterans Service Officer Program: Assist with claims resulting from active duty service.\n*Veterans Affairs Volunteer Service Program: Volunteer assistance in [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities by state|VA hospitals and clinics]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n*Military Order of the Devil Dogs: Fun and honor society of the MCL.\n\n==Publication==\nInitially, the official bulletin of the League was the ''Leatherneck Magazine'', which carried League news in every issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1924|orig-year=1924|title=Marine Corps League News|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/1924/05/marine-corps-league-news-2|journal=The Leatherneck Magazine|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation|publication-date=May 31, 1924|volume=7|issue=23|page=5|pages=|url-access=subscription |via=The Leatherneck Magazine}}</ref> The circulation of the ''Leatherneck Magazine'' at the time was over 5,200. Through the ''Leatherneck Magazine'' and the recruiting service of the U.S. Marine Corps, the information of the League's activities was disseminated and through these mediums the Major General Commandant's hope of building the Marine Corps Reserve to an appreciable size.\n\nEventually, the League would produce its own official publication, known as the ''Semper Fi Magazine'', but every now and then, the League is allowed to contribute articles to the ''Leatherneck Magazine''. The ''Semper Fi Magazine'' is published on a quarterly basis.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Marine Corps League is headed by an elected National Commandant, with 14 elected National Staff Officers who serve as trustees. The National Board of Trustees coordinates the efforts of 48 department, or state, entities and the activities of over 1,000 community-based detachments located throughout the United States and overseas. The day-to-day operations of the League are under the control of the Chief Operating Officer (formerly known as National Executive Director) with the responsibility for the management and direction of all programs, activities, and affairs of the Marine Corps League as well as supervising the National Headquarters staff.\n\n===National===\nThe prime authority of the League is derived from its Congressional charter and from its annual National Convention held each August in different major U.S. cities throughout the nation. It is a not-for-profit organization within the provisions of the Internal Revenue Service Code 501(c) (4), with a special group exemption letter which allows for contributions to the Marine Corps League, its Auxiliary and subsidiary units, to be tax deductible by the donor.\n\n===Divisions===\nTo obtain more effective administrative functioning, the United States is divided into geographical units called Divisions. The function of Divisions is administrative only. The duties and authority of the National Vice Commandants of Divisions are covered in the National Bylaws.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.mclnational.org/uploads/1/0/3/1/103183322/complete_2016_national_bylaws____administrative_procedures.pdf|title=Marine Corps League National Bylaws & Administrative Procedures|last=|first=|publisher=Marine Corps League|year=2017|isbn=|edition=1987|location=|page=AP 4-1|pages=|chapter=Chapter 4 - Divisions|orig-year=1987}}</ref> The Divisions of the Marine Corps League are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width:90%; text-align:center; cellpadding: 2; cellspacing: 0;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"10\"|MARINE CORPS LEAGUE DIVISIONS\n|-\n!Central\n!Mideast\n!Midwest\n!New England\n!Northeast\n!Northwest\n!Rocky Mountain\n!Southeast\n!Southern\n!Southwest\n|-\n|}\n\n*(1) Central Division - Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kentucky\n*(2) Mideast Division - Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom\n*(3) Midwest Division - Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota\n*(4) New England Division - Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island\n*(5) Northeast Division - New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania\n*(6) Northwest Division - Alaska, Washington, Montana, Oregon, Idaho\n*(7)  Rocky Mountain Division - Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming\n*(8) Southeast Division - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee\n*(9) Southern Division - Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas\n*(10) Southwest Division - Arizona, California, Nevada, Hawaii, Okinawa\n\n===Departments===\nA State in which there are three or more Detachments with a combined membership of sixty (60) or more members may be chartered as a Department by the National Board of Trustees upon receiving a written request from such Detachments via the jurisdictional National Division Vice Commandant.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.mclnational.org/uploads/1/0/3/1/103183322/complete_2016_national_bylaws____administrative_procedures.pdf|title=Marine Corps League National Bylaws & Administrative Procedures|last=|first=|publisher=Marine Corps League|year=2017|isbn=|edition=1987|location=|page=AP 5-1|pages=|chapter=Chapter 5 - Departments|orig-year=1987}}</ref>\n\n===Area===\nThe function of an Area is administrative only and is formed at the discretion of the Department. The Area Vice Commandant will be responsible for the Area.\n\n===Detachments===\nThe Detachment is the basic unit of the League and usually represents a small geographic area such as a single town or part of a county. There are over 1000 community-based Detachments located throughout the United States and overseas, supporting veterans and their families while being active and involved in the local community. The Detachment is used for formal business such as meetings and a coordination point for community service projects. A Detachment member is distinguished by a Red garrison cap with gold piping.\n\n==Notable members==\n* [[Sidney W. Brewster]]\n* [[Rev. John H. Clifford]]\n* [[James G. Harbord]]\n* [[Frank X.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent.

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Littleton, Cynthia |date=May 20, 1996 |title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html |journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /><ref>https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/afv-30th-anniversary-youtube-tiktok-alfonso-ribeiro-vin-di-bona-interview-1203421045/</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues.

A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007).

Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\"\n\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=America's Funniest Home Videos Accepts Submission Via Internet |date=February 16, 2008 |publisher=24-7PressRelease |url=https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/41231/americas-funniest-home-videos-accepts-submissions-via-internet |last1=Lindenbaum |first1=Sybil |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> During the 2011\u201312 season, the ''AFV'' [[iOS]] app was released on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], allowing users of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] mobile devices to record and upload videos for submission to the show; a version of the app was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices the following season. In the final six seasons of Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \"Funny Since 1989\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, with Saget returning to ''AFV'' for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling. The pinatas resembled the looks of the two hosts. On March 7, 2014, Bergeron announced on his [[Twitter]] account that his tenure as host of ''AFV'' would end after season 25.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/abc-the-bachelor-1201176554/ |title=ABC Renews 'The Bachelor,' 'Shark Tank,' 'Funniest Home Videos' |date=May 9, 2014 |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |access-date=May 9, 2014 |periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> ''AFV'' aired a 25th Anniversary Celebrity Celebration special in February 2015. Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=\"VarietyRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos' |date=May 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html |title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode |last=Nick Venable |date=May 18, 2015 |website=Cinema Blend |access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]).<ref name=\"THRRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/alfonso-ribeiro-host-americas-funniest-796980/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro Set as New Host of ABC's America's Funniest Home Videos |date=May 19, 2015 |publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media |access-date=May 19, 2015 |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV/><ref name=\"TheWrapRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/alfonso-ribeiro-to-replace-tom-bergeron-as-host-of-americas-funniest-home-videos/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro to Replace Tom Bergeron as Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos' |last=Jeff Sneider |date=May 19, 2015 |website=TheWrap |publisher=The Wrap News Inc. |access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches.\n\nIn May 2017, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 28th season and, in June 2017 (and continuing that summer scheduling format even in 2018), started airing summer reruns of current season episodes of ''AFV'' on Saturday nights at 8/7 central (until college football starts up in the fall) and Sunday nights at 7/6 central. For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12\u201314.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\" />\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |last=Levin |first=Josh |date=August 24, 2006 |publisher=Slate.com |access-date=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd |title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14\u201322, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McClellan, Steve |date=October 3, 1994 |title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\" |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html |journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1\u20135 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6\u20138 (1994\u201397). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1\u20135 aired on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] from 2004 to 2007, [[Nick at Nite]] from April 2007 to October 2013 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2013. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the TBS airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6\u20138 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2006 to October 2010 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6\u20138) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94\u201397 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003\u20132015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===VHS/DVD===\nABC, [[Shout!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Littleton, Cynthia |date=May 20, 1996 |title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html |journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /><ref>https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/afv-30th-anniversary-youtube-tiktok-alfonso-ribeiro-vin-di-bona-interview-1203421045/</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html |title='Funniest Home Videos' Outstrips '60 Minutes' |date=February 28, 1990 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Home video material that involves staged accidents, or/and adults, children, or babies getting seriously injured or the abuse of animals, or overall does not meet ABC network [[standards and practices]] are generally not accepted and will not appear on the show.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ernest Tucker |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html |title=Saget aims to clip hurtful video bits |date=April 27, 1990 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=March 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Every week, the producers choose three videos that the studio audience will vote on.

while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Series overview\n| auxA       = Host(s)\n| infoA      = Rank\n| infoB      = Average viewers<br />(in millions)\n\n| color0S    = #\n| linkT0S    = Special\n| auxA0S     = [[Bob Saget]]\n| episodes0S = 1\n| start0S    = {{Start date|1989|11|26}}\n| infoA0S    = {{N/a}}\n| infoB0S    = 32.0<ref name=\"LATimesJul2017\">{{Cite news |last=Battaglio |first=Stephen |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-abc-funniest-videos-20170718-story.html |title=Even in the age of YouTube, 'America's Funniest Home Videos' is still an ABC hit |date=July 18, 2017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=April 16, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416034607/https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-abc-funniest-videos-20170718-story.html |archive-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n| color1     = #\n| episodes1  = 15\n| start1     = {{Start date|1990|1|14}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1990|5|20}}\n| infoA1     = 5\n| infoB1     = 20.9<ref name=\"1989-92TopShows\">{{Cite book |last=Brooks |first=Tim |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA1692 |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946\u2013Present |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |date=2007 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4 |edition=9th |pages=1692\u20131693 |author-link=Tim Brooks (television historian) |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n| color2     = #\n| episodes2  = 25\n| start2     = {{Start date|1990|9|16}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1991|5|12}}\n| infoA2     = 7\n| infoB2     = 16.7<ref name=\"1989-92TopShows\" />\n\n| color3     = #\n| episodes3  = 25\n| start3     = {{Start date|1991|9|22}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1992|5|17}}\n| infoA3     = 20\n| infoB3     = 14.5<ref name=\"1989-92TopShows\" /><ref name=\"1991-92AvgRatings\">{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/4678a051626ef6cb1d41c646dc259126 |title=The Season's Top-Rated Shows for 1991-92 With AM-Nielsen-Season Ratings |date=April 14, 1992 |work=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=April 16, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.is/H2tJ9 |archive-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n| color4     = #\n| episodes4  = 25\n| start4     = {{Start date|1992|9|20}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1993|5|16}}\n| infoA4     = {{N/a}}\n| infoB4     = {{N/a}}\n\n| color5     = #\n| episodes5  = 22\n| start5     = {{Start date|1993|9|19}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1994|5|22}}\n| infoA5     = {{N/a}}\n| infoB5     = {{N/a}}\n\n| color6     = #\n| episodes6  = 23\n| start6     = {{Start date|1994|9|18}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1995|5|21}}\n| infoA6     = {{N/a}}\n| infoB6     = {{N/a}}\n\n| color7     = #\n| episodes7  = 22\n| start7     = {{Start date|1995|9|17}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1996|5|19}}\n| infoA7     = {{N/a}}\n| infoB7     = {{N/a}}\n\n| color8     = #\n| episodes8  = 30\n| start8     = {{Start date|1996|9|22}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1997|5|18}}\n| infoA8     = {{N/a}}\n| infoB8     = {{N/a}}\n\n| color9     = #\n| auxA9      = [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]]\n| episodes9  = 23\n| start9     = {{Start date|1998|1|5}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1998|5|20}}\n| infoA9     = 63\n| infoB9     = 11.3<ref name=\"1997-98AvgRatings\">{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/05/29/what-ranked-and-what-tanked/ |title=What ranked and what tanked |date=May 29, 1998 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200420163355/https://ew.com/article/1998/05/29/what-ranked-and-what-tanked/ |archive-date=April 20, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n| color10     = #\n| episodes10  = 23\n| start10     = {{Start date|1998|9|20}}\n| end10       = {{End date|1999|5|20}}\n| infoA10     = 109\n| infoB10     = 7.1<ref name=\"1999-99AvgRatings\">{{Cite web |url=http://geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html |title=TV Winners & Losers: Numbers Racket A Final Tally Of The Season's Show (Final ratings for the 1998-1999 TV season) |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020115727/http://geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html |archive-date=October 20, 2009 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |agency=[[Yahoo!

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors.

Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=\"VarietyRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos' |date=May 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html |title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode |last=Nick Venable |date=May 18, 2015 |website=Cinema Blend |access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]).<ref name=\"THRRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/alfonso-ribeiro-host-americas-funniest-796980/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro Set as New Host of ABC's America's Funniest Home Videos |date=May 19, 2015 |publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media |access-date=May 19, 2015 |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV/><ref name=\"TheWrapRibeiroAFV\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/alfonso-ribeiro-to-replace-tom-bergeron-as-host-of-americas-funniest-home-videos/ |title=Alfonso Ribeiro to Replace Tom Bergeron as Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos' |last=Jeff Sneider |date=May 19, 2015 |website=TheWrap |publisher=The Wrap News Inc. |access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches.\n\nIn May 2017, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 28th season and, in June 2017 (and continuing that summer scheduling format even in 2018), started airing summer reruns of current season episodes of ''AFV'' on Saturday nights at 8/7 central (until college football starts up in the fall) and Sunday nights at 7/6 central. For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12\u201314.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\" />\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |last=Levin |first=Josh |date=August 24, 2006 |publisher=Slate.com |access-date=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd |title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14\u201322, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McClellan, Steve |date=October 3, 1994 |title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\" |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html |journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1\u20135 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6\u20138 (1994\u201397). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1\u20135 aired on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] from 2004 to 2007, [[Nick at Nite]] from April 2007 to October 2013 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2013. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the TBS airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6\u20138 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2006 to October 2010 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6\u20138) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94\u201397 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003\u20132015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===VHS/DVD===\nABC, [[Shout!
