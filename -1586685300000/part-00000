Situated {{convert|341|km}} by road northeast of [[Mombasa]] that ends at [[Mokowe]] Jetty, from where the sea channel has to be crossed to reach Lamu Island. It is the headquarters of [[Lamu County]] and a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]].\n\nThe town contains the [[Lamu Fort]] on the seafront, constructed under [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], and was completed after his death in the early 1820s. Lamu is also home to 23 mosques, including the Riyadha Mosque, built in 1900, and a donkey sanctuary.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe original name of the town is Amu <ref>Romero, Patricia (1997). ''Lamu. History, Society, and Family in an East African Port City''. Marcus Wiener Publishers, p. 10</ref>, which the Arabs termed Al-Amu (\u0622\u0627\u0645\u0648) and the Portuguese \"Lamon\". The Portuguese applied the name to the entire island as Amu was the chief settlement.\n\nLamu Town on Lamu Island is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited town, and was one of the original [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlements along coastal East Africa. It is believed to have been established in 1370.<ref name=\"TIK\">{{cite book|title=This is Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUtrgTb9hZ8C&pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-84537-151-7|page=18}}</ref>\n\nToday, the majority of Lamu's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>Oded, Arye (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nThe town was first attested in writing by an Arab traveller Abu-al-Mahasini, who met a judge from Lamu visiting [[Mecca]] in 1441.\n\nIn 1506, the [[Portuguese]] fleet under [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] sent a ship to blockade Lamu, a few days later the rest of the fleet arrived forcing the king of the town to quickly concede to pay an annual tribute to them with 600 Meticals immediately.<ref>[[Strandes, Justus]] (1971). \"The Portuguese in East Africa\". East African Literature Bureau. p.66.</ref>  The Portuguese action was prompted by the nation's successful mission to control trade along the coast of the Indian Ocean. For a considerable time, Portugal had a monopoly on shipping along the East African coast and imposed export taxes on pre-existing local channels of commerce. In the 1580s, prompted by Turkish raids, Lamu led a rebellion against the Portuguese. In 1652, Oman assisted Lamu to resist Portuguese control.{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=89}}\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\n[[File:LamuFort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Lamu Fort]]]]\nLamu's years as an Omani protectorate during the period from the late 17th century to the early 19th century mark the town's golden age. Lamu was governed as a republic under a council of elders known as the ''Yumbe'' who ruled from a palace in the town; little exists of the palace today other than a ruined plot of land.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  During this period, Lamu became a center of poetry, politics, arts and crafts as well as trade. Many of the buildings of the town were constructed during this period in a distinct classical style.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  Aside from its thriving arts and crafts trading, Lamu became a literary and scholastic centre. Woman writers such as the poet [[Mwana Kupona]] \u2013 famed for her ''Advice on the Wifely Duty'' \u2013 had a higher status in Lamu than was the convention in Kenya at the time.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\nIn 1812, a coalition Pate-[[Mazrui]] army invaded the archipelago during the [[Battle of Shela]]. They landed at Shela with the intention of capturing Lamu and completing the fort which had begun to be constructed, but were violently suppressed by the locals in their boats on the beach as they tried to flee.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}} In fear of future attacks, Lamu appealed to the Omanis for a [[Busaidi]] garrison to operate at the new fort and help protect the area from Mazrui rebels along the Kenyan coast.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\n===Colonial period===\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Lamu came under the political influence of the [[sultan of Zanzibar]].\nThe Germans claimed [[Wituland]] in June 1885.{{sfn|McIntyre|McIntyre|2013|p=22}} The Germans considered Lamu to be of strategical importance and an ideal place for a base.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} From 22 November 1888 to 3 March 1891, there was a German post office in Lamu to facilitate communication within the German protectorate in the sultanate. It was the first post office to be established on the East African coast; today there is a museum in Lamu dedicated to it: the German Post Office Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/53/24/|title=Lamu: German Post Office Historical \u2013 Background|publisher=National Museums of Kenya|accessdate=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624142945/http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/53/24/|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1890, Lamu and Kenya fell under [[British Kenya|British colonial rule]] by the terms of the [[Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty]].

The old city is inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] as \"the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa\".\n\nOnce a center for the [[slave trade]], the population of Lamu is ethnically diverse. Lamu was on the main Arabian trading routes, and as a result, the population is largely [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} To respect the Muslim inhabitants, tourists in town are expected to wear more than shorts or bikinis.\n\nThere are several museums, including the [[Lamu Museum]], home to the island's ceremonial [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] (called ''siwa'');{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=343}} other museums are dedicated to [[Swahili culture]] and to the local [[Mail|postal service]]. Notable buildings in Lamu town include:\n\n===Lamu Fort===\n\nLamu Fort is a fort in the town. [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], started to build the fort on the seafront, to protect members of his unpopular government. He died in 1809, before the first storey of the fort was completed. The fort was completed by the early 1820s.\n\n===Riyadha Mosque===\n[[File:LAMU Riyadha Mosque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Riyadha Mosque]]\n[[Habib Salih]], a [[Sharif]] with family connections to the [[Hadramaut]], [[Yemen]], settled on Lamu in the 1880s, and became a highly respected religious teacher. Habib Salih had great success gathering students around him, and in 1900 the Riyadha Mosque was built.{{sfn|Briggs|2010|p=204}} He introduced [[Simthud Durar|Habshi ''Maulidi'']], where his students sang verse passages accompanied by tambourines. After his death in 1935 his sons continued the [[madrassa]], which became one of the most prestigious centres for Islamic studies in East Africa. The Mosque is the centre for the Maulidi Festival, which are held every year during the last week of the month of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s birth. During this festival, pilgrims from [[Sudan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Tanzania]] join the locals to sing the praise of Mohammad. Mnarani Mosque is also of note.\n\n===Donkey sanctuary===\nSince the island has no motorised vehicles, transportation and other heavy work is done with the help of donkeys. There are some 3000 donkeys on the island.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} Dr. [[Elisabeth Svendsen]] of [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] in England first visited Lamu in 1985. Worried by the conditions for the donkeys, the Sanctuary was opened in 1987.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} The Sanctuary provides treatment to all donkeys free of charge.\n\n==Culture==\nLamu is home to the [[Maulidi]] Festival, held in January or February, which celebrates Mohammed's birth. It features a range of activities from \"donkey races to [[dhow]]-sailing events and swimming competitions\".{{sfn|Bain|Bruyn|Williams|2010|p=284}} The Lamu Cultural Festival, a colourful carnival, {{Sfn|Ham|Butler|Starnes|2012|p=215}} is usually held in the last week of August, which since 2000 has featured traditional dancing, crafts including ''kofia'' embroidery, and dhow races.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} The Donkey Awards, with prizes given to the finest donkeys, are given in March/April.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} Women's music in the town is also of note and they perform the ''[[chakacha]]'', a wedding dance. Men perform the ''hanzua'' (a sword dance) and wear ''[[kanzu]]s''.{{sfn|Senoga-Zake|1986|p=68}}\n\nLamu Old Town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001, based on 3 criteria:\n* The architecture and urban structure of Lamu graphically demonstrate the cultural influences that have come together there over several hundred years from Europe, [[Arabia]], and [[India]], utilising traditional Swahili techniques to produce a distinct culture.\n* The growth and decline of the seaports on the East African coast and interaction between the [[Bantu people|Bantu]], Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], Indians, and Europeans represents a significant cultural and economic phase in the history of the region which finds its most outstanding expression in Lamu Old Town.\n* Its paramount trading role and its attraction for scholars and teachers gave Lamu an important religious function in the region, which it maintains to this day.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1055 Lamu Old Town], UNESCO</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lamu eseltransport.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Locals using a donkey for transport]]\nIn 2011, proposals were being advanced to build a deep-water port which would have much greater capacity in terms of depth of water, number of berths, and ability for vessels to arrive and depart at the same time than the country's main port at [[Mombasa]].<ref>''[[African Business]]'', May 2011</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Lamu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwsmith.com/ |title=Artist, Christian, Worship Leader \u2013 Community, News, Tour Dates, Cruise and More |publisher=Michael W.

Situated {{convert|341|km}} by road northeast of [[Mombasa]] that ends at [[Mokowe]] Jetty, from where the sea channel has to be crossed to reach Lamu Island. It is the headquarters of [[Lamu County]] and a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]].\n\nThe town contains the [[Lamu Fort]] on the seafront, constructed under [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], and was completed after his death in the early 1820s. Lamu is also home to 23 mosques, including the Riyadha Mosque, built in 1900, and a donkey sanctuary.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nLamu Town on Lamu Island is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited town, and was one of the original [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlements along coastal East Africa. It is believed to have been established in 1370.<ref name=\"TIK\">{{cite book|title=This is Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUtrgTb9hZ8C&pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-84537-151-7|page=18}}</ref>\n\nToday, the majority of Lamu's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>Oded, Arye (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nThe town was first attested in writing by an Arab traveller Abu-al-Mahasini, who met a judge from Lamu visiting [[Mecca]] in 1441.\n\nIn 1506, the [[Portuguese]] fleet under [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] sent a ship to blockade Lamu, a few days later the rest of the fleet arrived forcing the king of the town to quickly concede to pay an annual tribute to them with 600 Meticals immediately.<ref>[[Strandes, Justus]] (1971). \"The Portuguese in East Africa\". East African Literature Bureau. p.66.</ref>  The Portuguese action was prompted by the nation's successful mission to control trade along the coast of the Indian Ocean. For a considerable time, Portugal had a monopoly on shipping along the East African coast and imposed export taxes on pre-existing local channels of commerce. In the 1580s, prompted by Turkish raids, Lamu led a rebellion against the Portuguese. In 1652, Oman assisted Lamu to resist Portuguese control.{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=89}}\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\n[[File:LamuFort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Lamu Fort]]]]\nLamu's years as an Omani protectorate during the period from the late 17th century to the early 19th century mark the town's golden age. Lamu was governed as a republic under a council of elders known as the ''Yumbe'' who ruled from a palace in the town; little exists of the palace today other than a ruined plot of land.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  During this period, Lamu became a center of poetry, politics, arts and crafts as well as trade. Many of the buildings of the town were constructed during this period in a distinct classical style.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  Aside from its thriving arts and crafts trading, Lamu became a literary and scholastic centre. Woman writers such as the poet [[Mwana Kupona]] \u2013 famed for her ''Advice on the Wifely Duty'' \u2013 had a higher status in Lamu than was the convention in Kenya at the time.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\nIn 1812, a coalition Pate-[[Mazrui]] army invaded the archipelago during the [[Battle of Shela]]. They landed at Shela with the intention of capturing Lamu and completing the fort which had begun to be constructed, but were violently suppressed by the locals in their boats on the beach as they tried to flee.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}} In fear of future attacks, Lamu appealed to the Omanis for a [[Busaidi]] garrison to operate at the new fort and help protect the area from Mazrui rebels along the Kenyan coast.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\n===Colonial period===\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Lamu came under the political influence of the [[sultan of Zanzibar]].\nThe Germans claimed [[Wituland]] in June 1885.{{sfn|McIntyre|McIntyre|2013|p=22}} The Germans considered Lamu to be of strategical importance and an ideal place for a base.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} From 22 November 1888 to 3 March 1891, there was a German post office in Lamu to facilitate communication within the German protectorate in the sultanate.

The old city is inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] as \"the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa\".\n\nOnce a center for the [[slave trade]], the population of Lamu is ethnically diverse. Lamu was on the main Arabian trading routes, and as a result, the population is largely [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} To respect the Muslim inhabitants, tourists in town are expected to wear more than shorts or bikinis.\n\nThere are several museums, including the [[Lamu Museum]], home to the island's ceremonial [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] (called ''siwa'');{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=343}} other museums are dedicated to [[Swahili culture]] and to the local [[Mail|postal service]]. Notable buildings in Lamu town include:\n\n===Lamu Fort===\n\nLamu Fort is a fort in the town. [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], started to build the fort on the seafront, to protect members of his unpopular government. He died in 1809, before the first storey of the fort was completed. The fort was completed by the early 1820s.\n\n===Riyadha Mosque===\n[[File:LAMU Riyadha Mosque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Riyadha Mosque]]\n[[Habib Salih]], a [[Sharif]] with family connections to the [[Hadramaut]], [[Yemen]], settled on Lamu in the 1880s, and became a highly respected religious teacher. Habib Salih had great success gathering students around him, and in 1900 the Riyadha Mosque was built.{{sfn|Briggs|2010|p=204}} He introduced [[Simthud Durar|Habshi ''Maulidi'']], where his students sang verse passages accompanied by tambourines. After his death in 1935 his sons continued the [[madrassa]], which became one of the most prestigious centres for Islamic studies in East Africa. The Mosque is the centre for the Maulidi Festival, which are held every year during the last week of the month of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s birth. During this festival, pilgrims from [[Sudan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Tanzania]] join the locals to sing the praise of Mohammad. Mnarani Mosque is also of note.\n\n===Donkey sanctuary===\nSince the island has no motorised vehicles, transportation and other heavy work is done with the help of donkeys. There are some 3000 donkeys on the island.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} Dr. [[Elisabeth Svendsen]] of [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] in England first visited Lamu in 1985. Worried by the conditions for the donkeys, the Sanctuary was opened in 1987.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} The Sanctuary provides treatment to all donkeys free of charge.\n\n==Culture==\nLamu is home to the [[Maulidi]] Festival, held in January or February, which celebrates Mohammed's birth. It features a range of activities from \"donkey races to [[dhow]]-sailing events and swimming competitions\".{{sfn|Bain|Bruyn|Williams|2010|p=284}} The Lamu Cultural Festival, a colourful carnival, {{Sfn|Ham|Butler|Starnes|2012|p=215}} is usually held in the last week of August, which since 2000 has featured traditional dancing, crafts including ''kofia'' embroidery, and dhow races.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} The Donkey Awards, with prizes given to the finest donkeys, are given in March/April.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} Women's music in the town is also of note and they perform the ''[[chakacha]]'', a wedding dance. Men perform the ''hanzua'' (a sword dance) and wear ''[[kanzu]]s''.{{sfn|Senoga-Zake|1986|p=68}}\n\nLamu Old Town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001, based on 3 criteria:\n* The architecture and urban structure of Lamu graphically demonstrate the cultural influences that have come together there over several hundred years from Europe, [[Arabia]], and [[India]], utilising traditional Swahili techniques to produce a distinct culture.\n* The growth and decline of the seaports on the East African coast and interaction between the [[Bantu people|Bantu]], Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], Indians, and Europeans represents a significant cultural and economic phase in the history of the region which finds its most outstanding expression in Lamu Old Town.\n* Its paramount trading role and its attraction for scholars and teachers gave Lamu an important religious function in the region, which it maintains to this day.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1055 Lamu Old Town], UNESCO</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lamu eseltransport.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Locals using a donkey for transport]]\nIn 2011, proposals were being advanced to build a deep-water port which would have much greater capacity in terms of depth of water, number of berths, and ability for vessels to arrive and depart at the same time than the country's main port at [[Mombasa]].<ref>''[[African Business]]'', May 2011</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Lamu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwsmith.com/ |title=Artist, Christian, Worship Leader \u2013 Community, News, Tour Dates, Cruise and More |publisher=Michael W.

It was founded in 1532, the first year of Tenbun, on the twenty-fourth of the sixth [[lunar month]] by Takenouchi Ch\u016bnagon Daij\u014d Nakatsukasadaiy\u016b Hisamori, the lord of Ichinose Castle in [[Mimasaka Province|Sakush\u016b]]. Although it is famous for its j\u016bjutsu, Takenouchi Ry\u016b is actually a complete [[martial art]] including armed grappling (yoroi kumiuchi), staff (''[[b\u014djutsu]]''), sword (''[[kenjutsu]]''), sword drawing (''[[iaijutsu]]''), glaive (''[[naginatajutsu]]''), iron fan (''[[tessenjutsu]]''), restraining rope (''[[hoj\u014djutsu]]''), and resuscitation techniques (''sakkatsuh\u014d''). Its j\u016bjutsu techniques have been influential in the founding of many other schools in Japan. Takenouchi Ry\u016b is still actively transmitted today by members of the Takenouchi family, as well as by other groups both within and outside Japan.\n\nTogether with the [[Y\u014dshin-ry\u016b]] (\u694a\u5fc3\u6d41), and the [[Ry\u014di Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]], the Takenouchi-ry\u016b (\u7af9\u5185\u6d41) was one of the three largest, most important and influential J\u016bjutsu schools of the [[Edo period]] (\u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3 Edo jidai 1603 - 1868) before the rise of [[Judo]].<ref>Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu. by Serge Mol (2001)</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the ''Takenouchi Keisho Kogo Den'', the document recording the establishment and development of the school, Takenouchi Hisamori retired to the mountains near the Sannomiya shrine to train his martial skills. He practiced there for six days and six nights, wielding a ''[[bokken]]'' (wooden sword) two ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' and four ''sun'' in length (about 2&nbsp;ft. 4 in. or 72&nbsp;cm), a relatively long weapon for his purportedly short stature. On the sixth night he fell asleep from exhaustion using his ''bokken'' as a pillow. He was woken by a mountain priest with white hair and a long beard who seemed so fearsome to Hisamori that he thought it must be an incarnation of the god [[Atago Gongen|Atago]]. Hisamori attacked the stranger, but was defeated. The priest said to him \"When you meet the enemy, in that instant, life and death are decided. That is what is called ''hy\u014dh\u014d'' (military strategy).\" He then took Hisamori's ''bokken'', told him that long weapons were not useful in combat, and broke it into two daggers one ''shaku'' and two ''sun'' long. The priest told Hisamori to put these in his belt and call them ''kogusoku'', and taught him how to use them in grappling and [[close combat]]. These techniques became called ''koshi no mawari'', literally \"around the hips\". The priest then taught Hisamori how to bind and restrain enemies with rope, using a vine from a tree. Then the priest disappeared mysteriously amidst wind and lightning.\n\nTakenouchi Hisamori's second son Hitachinosuke Hisakatsu became the second head of Takenouchi Ry\u016b after his father formally passed him the tradition at the age of 64. He and his successor and son Kaganosuke Hisayoshi added their own techniques to the curriculum, extending it into a complete ''s\u014dg\u014d bujutsu'' system.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b is best known for its j\u016bjutsu, over which it covers an extensive ground. Its unarmed j\u016bjutsu techniques include ''tehodoki'' (grip breaking), ''ukemi'' (tumbling), ''nagewaza'' (throwing), ''kansetsuwaza'' (joint dislocation), ''atemi'' (striking weak points), ''shimewaza'' (choking),  ''newaza'' (ground techniques), and ''kapp\u014d'' (resuscitation). These are combined to form [[kata]] for the various sections of j\u016bjutsu taught, including ''toride'' (capturing and restraining), ''hade'' (attacking vital points unarmed), and ''kumiuchi'' (grappling). These unarmed kata are the best known of the Takenouchi Ry\u016b j\u016bjutsu, but they are not truly its foundation. As related in the establishment myth of the school, the central forms of j\u016bjutsu in Takenouchi Ry\u016b are the ''kogusoku koshi no mawari'', techniques of armed grappling using the short sword ''kogusoku'' against armed opponents. It is upon this foundation that the rest of the j\u016bjutsu techniques were developed by Hisakatsu and Hisayoshi, the second and third heads of the school.\n\nBeyond the core of j\u016bjutsu, many different weapons are taught. These include the sword, the staff, rope tying, the naginata, and more. The sword curriculum is divided into major sections, with ''kenjutsu'' covering basic swordsmanship against a similarly armed opponent, ''saide'' covering grappling with the sword, and ''iai'' covering the techniques of rapid sword drawing and striking. The staff is central to Takenouchi Ry\u016b's study of movement, and as such forms an important part of the curriculum. Staff work addresses various lengths of staff, in particular ''b\u014djutsu'' for the six ''shaku'' staff and ''shinb\u014d'' for a slightly shorter staff. Other sizes taught include ''j\u014djutsu'' for the common four ''shaku'' two ''sun'' staff, and ''hanb\u014d'' for shorter sticks around three ''shaku'' in length. Rope restraints are an important adjunct to the arresting arts of ''toride'', and the techniques of tying up opponents called ''hoj\u014djutsu'' or ''hobaku'' are taught using the ''haya nawa'' which is a two ''shaku'' five ''sun'' rope, traditionally of a purple color.\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b is perhaps lesser known for its other weapons techniques, but as a true ''s\u014dg\u014d bujutsu'' it retains a number of weapons for use both on and off the battlefield. The ''naginata'' and ''kusarigama'' are covered, as well as the ''jutte'' truncheon, ''shuriken'' throwing darts, and the ''tessen'' iron fan. Some kata feature rather peculiar weapons intended to show the use of everyday objects for defense against sword attacks. These include the ''kasa'', a Japanese style umbrella, and the ''nabebuta'', a wooden lid for a cooking pot.\n\n== Influence ==\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b has exerted a strong influence in the development of j\u016bjutsu. The  branches of the Takenouchi Ry\u016b have subsequently have influenced schools directly or indirectly and thus many techniques found in modern [[judo|j\u016bd\u014d]] and [[aikido|aikid\u014d]] can be traced back to their roots in Takenouchi Ry\u016b in one way or another.\nA number of important j\u016bjutsu kory\u016b were founded by students of the school, such as the Rikishin Ry\u016b, [[Fusen-ry\u016b|Fusen Ry\u016b]], [[Sosuishitsu-ryu|S\u014dsuishitsu Ry\u016b]], Takagi Ry\u016b and its branches (such as [[Hontai Yoshin-ryu|Hontai Y\u014dshin Ry\u016b]]), and Araki Ry\u016b. These ry\u016bha have incorporated many techniques from Takenouchi Ry\u016b either directly from the school or by analyzing the techniques of its exponents.\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b has documents by its founder on the use and teaching of rokushakubojutsu [{{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} stick]. This makes it the oldest verifiable school to teach these skills and it is believed to have had a great influence on other arts teaching rokushakubojutsu. Other arts have long histories and claim to have been teaching rokushakubo, but so far no documents from the period have been found. It may be that these other schools added it later on to their teachings.\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nAs with any kory\u016b, the lineage of Takenouchi Ry\u016b is a matter of importance and pride to its members. Since the tradition was maintained in the family a careful account of the successive leaders of the school has been kept over the centuries.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%<!--|Add alternative name here-->}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart | | | TNH | | | TNH=1.

This was done to ensure that the blood line and tradition would be preserved.\n\n=== Bitch\u016b Den===\nBesides the two divisions of the school given above, there are multiple groups claiming lineage of Takenouchi Ry\u016b. Among them, one group is called the Bitch\u016b Den Takenouchi Ry\u016b (\u7af9\u5185\u6d41 \u5099\u4e2d\u4f1d). The group claims that they directly originate from Bitchu Takenouchi-ryu, a branch of Takenouchi-ryu that spread at the early 17th century.\n\nThe Bitchu Takenouchi-ryu lineage was developed through Takeuchi Seidaiy\u016b Masatsugu, a disciple of the third headmaster of the family line of Takenouchi Ry\u016b, who moved to Okayama, the capital of [[Bitchu Province|Bitch\u016b Province]] (now western [[Okayama Prefecture]]).\n\nBitch\u016b Den lineage:\n: 4.

This school is extinct, but the writings of its last master Hideki Shimada are studied by the Bitch\u016b Den.<ref>[https://kogenbudo.org/takeuchi-santo-ryu/ Takeuchi Santo-ryu], Kogenbudo</ref>\n\n== International branches of Takenouchi-ryu Bitch\u016bden ==\nTwo varieties of training groups are authorized: dojo and study circles. Authorized dojo are usually headed by someone ranked Daigeiko or higher, have full teaching authority and limited authority to award rank. Study circles train with the permission of the head of Ch\u014dfukan Dojo, have limited teaching authority and no authority to award rank.

It was founded in 1532, the first year of Tenbun, on the twenty-fourth of the sixth [[lunar month]] by Takenouchi Ch\u016bnagon Daij\u014d Nakatsukasadaiy\u016b Hisamori, the lord of Ichinose Castle in [[Mimasaka Province|Sakush\u016b]]. Although it is famous for its j\u016bjutsu, Takenouchi Ry\u016b is actually a complete [[martial art]] including armed grappling (yoroi kumiuchi), staff (''[[b\u014djutsu]]''), sword (''[[kenjutsu]]''), sword drawing (''[[iaijutsu]]''), glaive (''[[naginatajutsu]]''), iron fan (''[[tessenjutsu]]''), restraining rope (''[[hoj\u014djutsu]]''), and resuscitation techniques (''sakkatsuh\u014d''). Its j\u016bjutsu techniques have been influential in the founding of many other schools in Japan. Takenouchi Ry\u016b is still actively transmitted today by members of the Takenouchi family, as well as by other groups both within and outside Japan.\n\nTogether with the [[Y\u014dshin-ry\u016b]] (\u694a\u5fc3\u6d41), and the [[Ry\u014di Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]], the Takenouchi-ry\u016b (\u7af9\u5185\u6d41) was one of the three largest, most important and influential J\u016bjutsu schools of the [[Edo period]] (\u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3 Edo jidai 1603 - 1868) before the rise of [[Judo]].<ref>Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu. by Serge Mol (2001)</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the ''Takenouchi Keisho Kogo Den'', the document recording the establishment and development of the school, Takenouchi Hisamori retired to the mountains near the Sannomiya shrine to train his martial skills. He practiced there for six days and six nights, wielding a ''[[bokken]]'' (wooden sword) two ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' and four ''sun'' in length (about 2&nbsp;ft. 4 in. or 72&nbsp;cm), a relatively long weapon for his purportedly short stature. On the sixth night he fell asleep from exhaustion using his ''bokken'' as a pillow. He was woken by a mountain priest with white hair and a long beard who seemed so fearsome to Hisamori that he thought it must be an incarnation of the god [[Atago Gongen|Atago]]. Hisamori attacked the stranger, but was defeated. The priest said to him \"When you meet the enemy, in that instant, life and death are decided. That is what is called ''hy\u014dh\u014d'' (military strategy).\" He then took Hisamori's ''bokken'', told him that long weapons were not useful in combat, and broke it into two daggers one ''shaku'' and two ''sun'' long. The priest told Hisamori to put these in his belt and call them ''kogusoku'', and taught him how to use them in grappling and [[close combat]]. These techniques became called ''koshi no mawari'', literally \"around the hips\". The priest then taught Hisamori how to bind and restrain enemies with rope, using a vine from a tree. Then the priest disappeared mysteriously amidst wind and lightning.\n\nTakenouchi Hisamori's second son Hitachinosuke Hisakatsu became the second head of Takenouchi Ry\u016b after his father formally passed him the tradition at the age of 64. He and his successor and son Kaganosuke Hisayoshi added their own techniques to the curriculum, extending it into a complete ''s\u014dg\u014d bujutsu'' system.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b is best known for its j\u016bjutsu, over which it covers an extensive ground. Its unarmed j\u016bjutsu techniques include ''tehodoki'' (grip breaking), ''ukemi'' (tumbling), ''nagewaza'' (throwing), ''kansetsuwaza'' (joint dislocation), ''atemi'' (striking weak points), ''shimewaza'' (choking),  ''newaza'' (ground techniques), and ''kapp\u014d'' (resuscitation). These are combined to form [[kata]] for the various sections of j\u016bjutsu taught, including ''toride'' (capturing and restraining), ''hade'' (attacking vital points unarmed), and ''kumiuchi'' (grappling). These unarmed kata are the best known of the Takenouchi Ry\u016b j\u016bjutsu, but they are not truly its foundation. As related in the establishment myth of the school, the central forms of j\u016bjutsu in Takenouchi Ry\u016b are the ''kogusoku koshi no mawari'', techniques of armed grappling using the short sword ''kogusoku'' against armed opponents. It is upon this foundation that the rest of the j\u016bjutsu techniques were developed by Hisakatsu and Hisayoshi, the second and third heads of the school.\n\nBeyond the core of j\u016bjutsu, many different weapons are taught. These include the sword, the staff, rope tying, the naginata, and more. The sword curriculum is divided into major sections, with ''kenjutsu'' covering basic swordsmanship against a similarly armed opponent, ''saide'' covering grappling with the sword, and ''iai'' covering the techniques of rapid sword drawing and striking. The staff is central to Takenouchi Ry\u016b's study of movement, and as such forms an important part of the curriculum. Staff work addresses various lengths of staff, in particular ''b\u014djutsu'' for the six ''shaku'' staff and ''shinb\u014d'' for a slightly shorter staff. Other sizes taught include ''j\u014djutsu'' for the common four ''shaku'' two ''sun'' staff, and ''hanb\u014d'' for shorter sticks around three ''shaku'' in length. Rope restraints are an important adjunct to the arresting arts of ''toride'', and the techniques of tying up opponents called ''hoj\u014djutsu'' or ''hobaku'' are taught using the ''haya nawa'' which is a two ''shaku'' five ''sun'' rope, traditionally of a purple color.\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b is perhaps lesser known for its other weapons techniques, but as a true ''s\u014dg\u014d bujutsu'' it retains a number of weapons for use both on and off the battlefield. The ''naginata'' and ''kusarigama'' are covered, as well as the ''jutte'' truncheon, ''shuriken'' throwing darts, and the ''tessen'' iron fan. Some kata feature rather peculiar weapons intended to show the use of everyday objects for defense against sword attacks. These include the ''kasa'', a Japanese style umbrella, and the ''nabebuta'', a wooden lid for a cooking pot.\n\n== Influence ==\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b has exerted a strong influence in the development of j\u016bjutsu. The  branches of the Takenouchi Ry\u016b have subsequently have influenced schools directly or indirectly and thus many techniques found in modern [[judo|j\u016bd\u014d]] and [[aikido|aikid\u014d]] can be traced back to their roots in Takenouchi Ry\u016b in one way or another.\nA number of important j\u016bjutsu kory\u016b were founded by students of the school, such as the Rikishin Ry\u016b, [[Fusen-ry\u016b|Fusen Ry\u016b]], [[Sosuishitsu-ryu|S\u014dsuishitsu Ry\u016b]], Takagi Ry\u016b and its branches (such as [[Hontai Yoshin-ryu|Hontai Y\u014dshin Ry\u016b]]), and Araki Ry\u016b. These ry\u016bha have incorporated many techniques from Takenouchi Ry\u016b either directly from the school or by analyzing the techniques of its exponents.\n\nTakenouchi Ry\u016b has documents by its founder on the use and teaching of rokushakubojutsu [{{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} stick]. This makes it the oldest verifiable school to teach these skills and it is believed to have had a great influence on other arts teaching rokushakubojutsu. Other arts have long histories and claim to have been teaching rokushakubo, but so far no documents from the period have been found. It may be that these other schools added it later on to their teachings.\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nAs with any kory\u016b, the lineage of Takenouchi Ry\u016b is a matter of importance and pride to its members. Since the tradition was maintained in the family a careful account of the successive leaders of the school has been kept over the centuries.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%<!--|Add alternative name here-->}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart | | | TNH | | | TNH=1.

This was done to ensure that the blood line and tradition would be preserved.\n\n=== Bitch\u016b Den===\nBesides the two divisions of the school given above, there are multiple groups claiming lineage of Takenouchi Ry\u016b. Among them, one group is called the Bitch\u016b Den Takenouchi Ry\u016b (\u7af9\u5185\u6d41 \u5099\u4e2d\u4f1d). The group claims that they directly originate from Bitchu Takenouchi-ryu, a branch of Takenouchi-ryu that spread at the early 17th century. \n\nThe Bitchu Takenouchi-ryu lineage was developed through Takeuchi Seidaiy\u016b Masatsugu, a disciple of the third headmaster of the family line of Takenouchi Ry\u016b, who moved to Okayama, the capital of [[Bitchu Province|Bitch\u016b Province]] (now western [[Okayama Prefecture]]).\n\nBitch\u016b Den lineage:\n: 4.

This school is extinct, but the writings of its last master Hideki Shimada are studied by the Bitch\u016b Den.<ref>[https://kogenbudo.org/takeuchi-santo-ryu/ Takeuchi Santo-ryu], Kogenbudo</ref>\n\n== International branches of Takenouchi-ryu Bitch\u016bden ==\nTwo varieties of training groups are authorized: dojo and study circles. Authorized dojo are usually headed by someone ranked Daigeiko or higher, have full teaching authority and limited authority to award rank.

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (rugby league)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (rugby league)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

The story begins by introducing the characters (\"Prologue\"), and then sets up the character Pierre, an old, sad, wealthy aristocrat, who is having an existential crisis, living a slothful life of wine, philosophy, and inaction (\"Pierre\"). He is best friends with Prince Andrey Bolkonsky (also sometimes spelt as Andrei), who has left to go to war. Andrey has recently become engaged to the young, beautiful countess Natasha Rostova. Natasha and her cousin Sonya arrive in Moscow to stay the winter with Natasha's godmother, Marya D., while Natasha waits for Andrey to return from the war. Marya D. is an old friend of Pierre's (\"Moscow\"). Marya D. advises Natasha that she must visit her future in-laws, the demented old Prince Bolkonsky and his pitiable [[spinster]] daughter Mary (\"The Private and Intimate Life of the House\"), to win their affection in advance of the marriage, which is critical to the status and fortune of the Rostov family. However, Natasha's visit with Mary and Bolkonsky ends in disaster (\"Natasha & Bolkonskys\"), as Mary finds Natasha vain, Natasha finds Mary cold, and Bolkonsky behaves bizarrely. Natasha leaves their home missing Andrey more than ever (\"No One Else\").\n\nThe next night Natasha is introduced to decadent Moscow society and watches an amazing performance with Marya and Sonya (\"The Opera\"). There she meets Prince Anatole Kuragin, a young and handsome man, who turns out to be a notorious rogue. He comes to visit Natasha's box and leaves her with feelings she has never experienced before (\"Natasha & Anatole\").\n\nAnatole comes home after the opera and he, his friend Dolokhov, and Pierre go out drinking; they are met by Pierre's unpleasant wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who taunts Pierre and flirts with Dolokhov. Anatole plots with Dolokhov and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to have the young woman he just met, although he is already married. Dolokhov taunts Pierre, toasting to the wives of society and their lovers. Pierre finds his wife's familiarity with Dolokhov offensive and drunkenly challenges him to a duel, accidentally wounding Dolokhov. When it is Dolokhov's turn to shoot, Pierre stands openly in front of the bullet, but Dolokhov miraculously misses him (\"The Duel\"). Before they all leave, Anatole asks H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to convince Natasha to come to the costume ball that she is hosting that evening. She agrees and they leave Pierre. Alone, Pierre reflects on his near-death experience and realizes that despite wasting his life, he wishes to live (\"Dust and Ashes\").\n\nNatasha and her family go to church the next morning. She is confused about her interaction with Anatole the night before, and questions if she is spoiled of Andrey's love (\"Sunday Morning\"). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne does as her brother asks and visits Natasha. She invites her to the ball that she is hosting that night,\nand eventually Natasha agrees to come (\"Charming\"). That night, Natasha meets Anatole, and they dance. Anatole tells Natasha that he loves her, but she protests, reminding Anatole that she is betrothed to Andrey. Ignoring this, Anatole kisses her, leading her to fall in love with him in return (\"The Ball\").\n\n===Act 2===\nAnatole and Natasha make plans to elope\u2014she still does not know that he is married\u2014and Natasha tearfully breaks off her engagement with Andrey, while Pierre writes to him of his belief that Napoleon is the biblical [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of Revelation]], and that he is destined to be Napoleon's assassin (\"Letters\"). Sonya finds out about the plan and realizes it will mean Natasha's ruin (\"Sonya & Natasha\"); Sonya determines to save Natasha from herself even if it means she will lose her closest friend (\"Sonya Alone\"). That evening Anatole and Dolokhov plan for the elopement (\"Preparations\"), and Dolokhov tries to change Anatole's mind with no success. Balaga, their trusted troika driver (\"Balaga\"), soon arrives to take them to Natasha's house and a wild party ensues as Anatole bids farewell to his friends. However, they are thwarted at the last moment by Marya D. (\"The Abduction\"). Marya D. scolds Natasha but then tries to comfort her with Sonya's help. Natasha screams at them, breaks down and waits for Anatole to come back for her all night (\"In My House\").\n\nMarya D. calls on Pierre in the middle of the night (\"A Call to Pierre\"), begging him to handle the crisis, and Pierre finally learns that the object of Anatole's conquest is Natasha. Marya D. finds out that Anatole is married and tells a grief-stricken Natasha. Pierre, outraged, searches for Anatole (\"Find Anatole\"). When Pierre finds Anatole, he comes close to attacking him in rage, but instead gives him money and orders him to leave Moscow (\u201dPierre & Anatole\u201d). Natasha poisons herself with arsenic (\"Natasha Very Ill\") but lives. The next day Andrey returns. Pierre explains the scandal to him and asks him to be compassionate, but Andrey is unable to forgive Natasha and will not ask for her hand in marriage again (\"Pierre & Andrey\"). Finally, Pierre visits Natasha (\"Pierre & Natasha\") and he comforts the distraught girl, giving her hope. After their meeting, Pierre experiences a moment of enlightenment himself while seeing [[Great Comet of 1811|The Great Comet of 1812]] in the night sky (\u201cThe Great Comet of 1812\u201d).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Original Cast Recording [CD booklet].

The story begins by introducing the characters (\"Prologue\"), and then sets up the character Pierre, an old, sad, wealthy aristocrat, who is having an existential crisis, living a slothful life of wine, philosophy, and inaction (\"Pierre\"). He is best friends with Prince Andrey Bolkonsky (also sometimes spelt as Andrei), who has left to go to war. Andrey has recently become engaged to the young, beautiful countess Natasha Rostova. Natasha and her cousin Sonya arrive in Moscow to stay the winter with Natasha's godmother, Marya D., while Natasha waits for Andrey to return from the war. Marya D. is an old friend of Pierre's (\"Moscow\"). Marya D. advises Natasha that she must visit her future in-laws, the demented old Prince Bolkonsky and his pitiable [[spinster]] daughter Mary (\"The Private and Intimate Life of the House\"), to win their affection in advance of the marriage, which is critical to the status and fortune of the Rostov family. However, Natasha's visit with Mary and Bolkonsky ends in disaster (\"Natasha & Bolkonskys\"), as Mary finds Natasha vain, Natasha finds Mary cold, and Bolkonsky behaves bizarrely. Natasha leaves their home missing Andrey more than ever (\"No One Else\").\n\nThe next night Natasha is introduced to decadent Moscow society and watches an amazing performance with Marya and Sonya (\"The Opera\"). There she meets Prince Anatole Kuragin, a young and handsome man, who turns out to be a notorious rogue. He comes to visit Natasha's box and leaves her with feelings she has never experienced before (\"Natasha & Anatole\").\n\nAnatole comes home after the opera and he, his friend Dolokhov, and Pierre go out drinking; they are met by Pierre's unpleasant wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who taunts Pierre and flirts with Dolokhov. Anatole plots with Dolokhov and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to have the young woman he just met, although he is already married. Dolokhov taunts Pierre, toasting to the wives of society and their lovers. Pierre finds his wife's familiarity with Dolokhov offensive and drunkenly challenges him to a duel, accidentally wounding Dolokhov. When it is Dolokhov's turn to shoot, Pierre stands openly in front of the bullet, but Dolokhov miraculously misses him (\"The Duel\"). Before they all leave, Anatole asks H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to convince Natasha to come to the costume ball that she is hosting that evening. She agrees and they leave Pierre. Alone, Pierre reflects on his near-death experience and realizes that despite wasting his life, he wishes to live (\"Dust and Ashes\").\n\nNatasha and her family go to church the next morning. She is confused about her interaction with Anatole the night before, and questions if she is spoiled of Andrey's love (\"Sunday Morning\"). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne does as her brother asks and visits Natasha. She invites her to the ball that she is hosting that night,\nand eventually Natasha agrees to come (\"Charming\"). That night, Natasha meets Anatole, and they dance. Anatole tells Natasha that he loves her, but she protests, reminding Anatole that she is betrothed to Andrey. Ignoring this, Anatole kisses her, leading her to fall in love with him in return (\"The Ball\").\n\n===Act 2===\nAnatole and Natasha make plans to elope\u2014she still does not know that he is married\u2014and Natasha tearfully breaks off her engagement with Andrey, while Pierre writes to him of his belief that Napoleon is the biblical [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of Revelation]], and that he is destined to be Napoleon's assassin (\"Letters\"). Sonya finds out about the plan and realizes it will mean Natasha's ruin (\"Sonya & Natasha\"); Sonya determines to save Natasha from herself even if it means she will lose her closest friend (\"Sonya Alone\"). That evening Anatole and Dolokhov plan for the elopement (\"Preparations\"), and Dolokhov tries to change Anatole's mind with no success. Balaga, their trusted troika driver (\"Balaga\"), soon arrives to take them to Natasha's house and a wild party ensues as Anatole bids farewell to his friends. However, they are thwarted at the last moment by Marya D. (\"The Abduction\"). Marya D. scolds Natasha but then tries to comfort her with Sonya's help. Natasha screams at them, breaks down and waits for Anatole to come back for her all night (\"In My House\").\n\nMarya D. calls on Pierre in the middle of the night (\"A Call to Pierre\"), begging him to handle the crisis, and Pierre finally learns that the object of Anatole's conquest is Natasha. Marya D. finds out that Anatole is married and tells a grief-stricken Natasha. Pierre, outraged, searches for Anatole (\"Find Anatole\"). When Pierre finds Anatole, he comes close to attacking him in rage, but instead gives him money and orders him to leave Moscow (\u201dPierre & Anatole\u201d). Natasha poisons herself with arsenic (\"Natasha Very Ill\") but lives. The next day Andrey returns. Pierre explains the scandal to him and asks him to be compassionate, but Andrey is unable to forgive Natasha and will not ask for her hand in marriage again (\"Pierre & Andrey\"). Finally, Pierre visits Natasha (\"Pierre & Natasha\") and he comforts the distraught girl, giving her hope. After their meeting, Pierre experiences a moment of enlightenment himself while seeing [[Great Comet of 1811|The Great Comet of 1812]] in the night sky (\u201cThe Great Comet of 1812\u201d).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Original Cast Recording [CD booklet].
