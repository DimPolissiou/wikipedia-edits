Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/>\n\nGoal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.<ref name=\"who.int\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/|title=WHO - UN Sustainable Development Summit 2015|website=WHO}}</ref> Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15\u201319.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Data for girls of greatest concern \u2013 those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/>\n\nSimilarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000\u20132016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15\u201319.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/>  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].\n\nGoal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.<ref name=\"who.int\"/> It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.<ref name=\"who.int\"/> 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the [[measles vaccine]] (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively.

In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.\n\nAdditionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.\n\n[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/> Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.<ref name=\"SDGChildren2018\"/>\n\nAchieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Goal 05.

The nation's holistic goal is the pursuit of [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH),<ref>https://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/</ref> a term coined in 1972 by the Fourth King of Bhutan, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], which has the principal guiding philosophy for the long term journey as a nation. Therefore, the SDGs find a natural and spontaneous place within the framework of GNH sharing a common vision of prosperity, peace, and harmony where no one is left behind. Just as GNH is both an ideal to be pursued and a practical tool so too the SDGs inspire and guide sustainable action.\nGuided by the development paradigm of GNH, Bhutan is committed to achieving the goals of SDGs by 2030 since its implementation in September 2015. In line with Bhutan's commitment to the implementation of the SDGs and sustainable development, Bhutan has participated in the Voluntary National Review in the 2018 High-Level Political Forum.<ref>https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/memberstates/bhutan</ref> \nAs the country has progressed in its 12th [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five year plan]] (2019-2023), the national goals have been aligned with the SDGs and every agency plays a vital role in its own ways to collectively achieving the committed goals of SDGs.\n\n==Communicating the Sustainable Development Goals ==\n[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]\nUN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience.

(2019): Sustainable Development Report 2019. New York: Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.<ref>http://www.sustainablesids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NGOs-leading-SDGs-Sustainable-Brands.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Competing goals ===\n\n{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}\nSome of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] can make it difficult to attain [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nContinued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global [[eco-economic decoupling]] is far higher than any country has achieved in the past.<ref name=\":15\" /> Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target [[resource]] use per capita, with \"substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations.\"<ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal | last=Hickel | first=Jason | title=The contradiction of the sustainable development goals: Growth versus ecology on a finite planet | journal=Sustainable Development | publisher=Wiley | date=2019-04-15 | issn=0968-0802 | doi=10.1002/sd.1947 | page=}}</ref>\n\n=== Too many goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as \"sprawling, misconceived\" and \"a mess\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals. In addition, Bhargava (2019) has emphasized the inter-dependence between the numerous sub-goals and the role played by population growth in developing countries in hampering their operationalization.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Weak on environmental sustainability ===\n\nEnvironmental constraints and [[planetary boundaries]] are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper \"Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wackernagel|first=Mathis|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Lin|first3=David|date=2017|title=Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2017.00018|issn=2296-598X}}</ref>\" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs ''per se'', but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 said that the SDGs are \"a mess\" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.<ref name=\":5\" /> The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development.{{Clarify|reason=What's the difference between \"development\" and \"sustainable development\"?|date=June 2019}} Finally, the MDGs used a sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nWhilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Another core feature of the SDGs is their focus on means of implementation, or the mobilization of financial resources, along with capacity building and technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Action for Climate Empowerment]]\n* [[Economics of climate change mitigation]]\n* [[Education 2030 Agenda]]\n* [[Planetary management]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals and Iran]]\n\n==Further reading==\nBhargava, A.

Therefore, the SDGs find a natural and spontaneous place within the framework of GNH sharing a common vision of prosperity, peace, and harmony where no one is left behind. Just as GNH is both an ideal to be pursued and a practical tool so too the SDGs inspire and guide sustainable action.\nGuided by the development paradigm of GNH, Bhutan is committed to achieving the goals of SDGs by 2030 since its implementation in September 2015.

(2019): Sustainable Development Report 2019. New York: Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.<ref>http://www.sustainablesids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NGOs-leading-SDGs-Sustainable-Brands.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Competing goals ===\n\n{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}\nSome of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] can make it difficult to attain [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nContinued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global [[eco-economic decoupling]] is far higher than any country has achieved in the past.<ref name=\":15\" /> Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target [[resource]] use per capita, with \"substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations.\"<ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal | last=Hickel | first=Jason | title=The contradiction of the sustainable development goals: Growth versus ecology on a finite planet | journal=Sustainable Development | publisher=Wiley | date=2019-04-15 | issn=0968-0802 | doi=10.1002/sd.1947 | page=}}</ref>\n\n=== Too many goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as \"sprawling, misconceived\" and \"a mess\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals. In addition, Bhargava (2019) has emphasized the inter-dependence between the numerous sub-goals and the role played by population growth in developing countries in hampering their operationalization.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Weak on environmental sustainability ===\n\nEnvironmental constraints and [[planetary boundaries]] are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper \"Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wackernagel|first=Mathis|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Lin|first3=David|date=2017|title=Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2017.00018|issn=2296-598X}}</ref>\" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs ''per se'', but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals ===\nA commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 said that the SDGs are \"a mess\" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.<ref name=\":5\" /> The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development.{{Clarify|reason=What's the difference between \"development\" and \"sustainable development\"?|date=June 2019}} Finally, the MDGs used a sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nWhilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Another core feature of the SDGs is their focus on means of implementation, or the mobilization of financial resources, along with capacity building and technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Action for Climate Empowerment]]\n* [[Economics of climate change mitigation]]\n* [[Education 2030 Agenda]]\n* [[Planetary management]]\n* [[Social Progress Index]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals and Iran]]\n\n==Further reading==\nBhargava, A.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot]]: \"History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\"</ref><ref name=Pettegree3>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. \"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market\u2014and by the sixteenth century it was a real market\u2014was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\"</ref> Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.<ref name=Park675>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 675\u2013676. \"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\"</ref> News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past\u2014or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, na\u00efve empiricism could not last.\"</ref> News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nParadoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. \"Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often\u2014whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder\u2014to shock.\"</ref><ref name=SKH>{{cite journal | last1 = Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck | first1 = Jesper | last2 = Karlsson | first2 = Michael | last3 = Hopmann | first3 = Nicolas | year = 2012 | title = Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news | url = | journal = Journalism Studies | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 5\u20136 }}</ref> This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105\u2013106.</ref> A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, \"if it bleeds, it leads\".<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.</ref>\n\n===Newsworthiness===\nNewsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.</ref> War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of telecommunication}}\n\n===Folk news===\nEvidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. \"The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing\u2014let alone printing presses or computers\u2014to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. [\u2026] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange.\"</ref> Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.</ref> Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, [[town crier]]s, etc.<ref>Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available. The history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was introduced in England in the 16th century.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. \"A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth\u2014the coffeehouse\u2014flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television.\"</ref> In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.<ref>Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.</ref> In late medieval Britain, reports (\"tidings\") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.<ref>Lim, \"Take Writing\" (2006), pp. 1\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Government proclamations===\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 St\u00e4ndebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]\n\nBefore the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.<ref>[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=19 May 2011}}</ref> The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Bleumer|first=Gerrit|title=Electronic Postage Systems: Technology, Security, Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCdvPCBHCjwC&pg=PA2|year=2007|page=2|isbn=9780387446066}}</ref> [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming dictator of Rome began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988).\"</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at mosques, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33\u201338.</ref> The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58\u201372, 133\u2013136. \"In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3).

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1-4165-4861-4|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref> Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.<ref>Sara Shipley Hiles & Amanda Hinnart, \"Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming\"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.</ref>\n\nSome commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.<ref>John Soloski, \"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\", from ''Media, Culture & Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143\u2013145.</ref> This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: \"Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words.\"<ref>Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.</ref> In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.</ref> News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: \"The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead.

News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. \"Rituals of objectivity\", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.<ref>James S.

The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10.

To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary.

News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests.

The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

Similar rollers are used also at landfills or in agriculture.\n\nRoad rollers are frequently referred to as [[steamroller]]s, regardless of their method of propulsion.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|Steamroller}}\n\n[[Image:Deutsches Stra\u00dfenmuseum, Germersheim. Horse-drawn road roller 01.jpg|thumb|Horse-drawn road roller from 1800]]\n[[Image:Steam engine Lausanne 2.jpg|thumb| [[Steam engine|Steam]]-powered roller]]\n[[Image:ZettelmeyerWalze.jpg|thumb|[[Zettelmeyer]] diesel-powered road roller]]\n\nThe first road rollers were [[horse]]-drawn, and were probably just borrowed farm implements'' (see [[Roller (agricultural tool)|Roller]])''.\n\nSince the effectiveness of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were [[steam roller]]s. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs with [[low gear|low gearing]] to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls in much the same way as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as \"chip chasers\" which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.\n\nAs internal combustion engine technology improved during the 20th century, [[kerosene]]-, [[gasoline]]- (petrol), and [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered rollers gradually replaced their [[steam]]-powered counterparts. The first internal-combustion powered road rollers were very similar to the steam rollers they replaced. They used similar mechanisms to transmit power from the engine to the wheels, typically large, exposed spur gears. Some users did not like them in their infancy, as the engines of the era were typically difficult to start, particularly the kerosene-powered ones.\n\nVirtually all road rollers in commercial use now use diesel power.\n\n==Uses on a road==\nRoad rollers use the weight of the vehicle to compress the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial [[Soil compaction|compaction]] of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways, a four-wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed, and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads, a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used.\n\nThe next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface.\n\nThe next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller, or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (there is, however, an exception if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine).\n\nThe final wear course of [[asphalt concrete]] (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.\n\nRollers are also used in [[landfill]] compaction.

Similar rollers are used also at landfills or in agriculture.\n\nRoad rollers are frequently referred to as [[steamroller]]s, regardless of their method of propulsion.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|Steamroller}}\n\n[[Image:Deutsches Stra\u00dfenmuseum, Germersheim. Horse-drawn road roller 01.jpg|thumb|Horse-drawn road roller from 1800]]\n[[Image:Steam engine Lausanne 2.jpg|thumb| [[Steam engine|Steam]]-powered roller]]\n[[Image:ZettelmeyerWalze.jpg|thumb|[[Zettelmeyer]] diesel-powered road roller]]\n\nThe first road rollers were [[horse]]-drawn, and were probably just borrowed farm implements'' (see [[Roller (agricultural tool)|Roller]])''.\n\nSince the effectiveness of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were [[steam roller]]s. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs with [[low gear|low gearing]] to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls in much the same way as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as \"chip chasers\" which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.\n\nAs internal combustion engine technology improved during the 20th century, [[kerosene]]-, [[gasoline]]- (petrol), and [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered rollers gradually replaced their [[steam]]-powered counterparts. The first internal-combustion powered road rollers were very similar to the steam rollers they replaced. They used similar mechanisms to transmit power from the engine to the wheels, typically large, exposed spur gears. Some users did not like them in their infancy, as the engines of the era were typically difficult to start, particularly the kerosene-powered ones.\n\nVirtually all road rollers in commercial use now use diesel power.\n\n==Uses on a road==\nRoad rollers use the weight of the vehicle to compress the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial [[Soil compaction|compaction]] of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways, a four-wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed, and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads, a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used.\n\nThe next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface.\n\nThe next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller, or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (there is, however, an exception if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine).\n\nThe final wear course of [[asphalt concrete]] (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.\n\nRollers are also used in [[landfill]] compaction. Such compactors typically have padfoot or \"sheep's foot\" drums, and do not achieve a smooth surface. The pads aid in compression, due to the smaller area contacting the ground.\n\n==Configurations==\n[[File:Construction site near Yass site cleared and bull dozed cleared steam roller in background.JPG|thumb|Flattened and leveled construction site with road roller in the background]]\n\nThe roller can be a simple drum with a handle that is operated by one person and weighs {{convert|100|lb|order=flip}} or as large as a ride-on road roller weighing {{convert|20|t}} and costing more than [[United States dollar|US$]]150,000.
