In 1930 he enrolled in the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|University of Washington Program in Architecture]], graduating in 1935 with a Bachelor of Architecture ([[B.Arch.]]).  In this period he also worked in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].  After apprenticing in a number of private Seattle firms and serving in the military during [[World War II]], he joined the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Washington]] in 1946.  He also initiated his own practice and, over the next two decades, designed a series of regional-modernist residences, built with indigenous materials suited to the climate.\n\nSteinbrueck's focus on the character of Seattle's architecture and urban places dates from the early 1950s when he authored ''A Guide to Seattle Architecture'', published for  [[American Institute of Architects]] national convention held in Seattle in 1953.

In this period he also worked in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].  After apprenticing in a number of private Seattle firms and serving in the military during [[World War II]], he joined the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Washington]] in 1946.  He also initiated his own practice and, over the next two decades, designed a series of regional-modernist residences, built with indigenous materials suited to the climate.\n\nSteinbrueck's focus on the character of Seattle's architecture and urban places dates from the early 1950s when he authored ''A Guide to Seattle Architecture'', published for  [[American Institute of Architects]] national convention held in Seattle in 1953.

Duels in this form were chiefly practiced in [[early modern Europe]] with precedents in the medieval code of [[chivalry]], and continued into the modern period (18th to late 19th centuries, if not beyond) especially among [[Officer (armed forces)|military officers]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), duels were mostly fought with [[sword]]s (the [[rapier]], and later the [[small sword]]), but beginning in the late 18th century in [[England]], duels were more commonly fought using [[pistol]]s. [[Fencing]] and pistol duels continued to co-exist throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe duel was based on a code of [[honour|honor]]. Duels were fought not so much to kill the opponent as to gain \"satisfaction\", that is, to restore one's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one's life for it, and as such the tradition of dueling was originally reserved for the male members of [[nobility]]; however, in the modern era it extended to those of the [[upper classes]] generally. On occasion, duels with [[pistol]]s or swords were fought between women.<ref>Hopton, p.182</ref><ref>Hopton, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nLegislation against dueling goes back to the medieval period. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) outlawed duels,<ref>IV Lateran c. 18, Peter R. Coss, ''The Moral World of the Law'',  Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 78</ref> and civil legislation in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against dueling was passed in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=\"Liszt\"/>\nFrom the early 17th century, duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced. Dueling largely fell out of favor in England by the mid-19th century and in [[Continental Europe]] by the turn of the 20th century. Dueling declined in the [[Eastern United States]] in the 19th century and by the time the [[American Civil War]] broke out, dueling had begun to wane even in the \n[[Southern United States|South]].<ref name=uuooooav>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/dueling.html The History of Dueling in America] PBS.org, Accessed February 8, 2014</ref> Public opinion, not legislation, caused the change.<ref name=uuooooav />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and Middle Ages===\n[[File:Gerichtlicher Zweikampf.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a judicial combat in the Dresden codex of the ''Sachsenspiegel'' (early to mid-14th century), illustrating the provision that the two combatants must \"share the sun\", i.e. align themselves perpendicular to the Sun so that neither has an advantage.]]\n{{Further|Single combat}}\n[[File:Manifesto disfida di barletta.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative poster for the fourth centennial of the ''Disfida di Barletta'', the [[Challenge of Barletta]], fought on 13 February 1503 between 13 Italian and 13 French [[knights]] all shown wearing full [[plate armour]].]]\n\nIn [[Western world|Western]] society, the formal concept of a duel developed out of the [[mediaeval|medieval]] [[judicial duel]] and older pre-Christian practices such as the [[Viking Age]] ''[[holmgang]]''. In Medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Boydell Press (November 18, 2010). pp. 157-160. {{ISBN|978-1843835967}}</ref> Countries like [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Ireland]] practiced this tradition. Judicial combat took two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms was used to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The battle was fought as a result of a slight or challenge to one party's [[honor]] which could not be resolved by a court. Weapons were standardized and typical of a knight's armoury, for example longswords, polearms etc., however, weapon quality and augmentations were at the discretion of the knight, for example, a spiked hand guard or an extra grip for half-swording. The parties involved would wear their own armour; for example, one knight wearing full plate might face another wearing chain mail. The duel lasted until one party could no longer fight back. In early cases, the defeated party was then executed. This type of duel soon evolved into the more [[Chivalry|chivalric]] ''[[pas d'armes]],'' or \"passage of arms\", a chivalric [[hastilude]] that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. A knight or group of knights (''tenans'' or \"holders\") would stake out a travelled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (''venans'' or \"comers\") must first fight, or be disgraced.<ref>Hubbard, Ben. ''Gladiators: From Spartacus to Spitfires''. Canary Press (August 15, 2011). Chapter: Pas D'armes. ASIN: B005HJTS8O.</ref> If a traveling ''venans'' did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the ''venans'' chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] was critical of dueling throughout medieval history, frowning both on the traditions of [[judicial combat]] and on the duel on points of [[honour|honor]] among the nobility.\nJudicial duels were deprecated by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215, but the judicial duel persisted in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into the 15th century.<ref>\nIn 1459 (''MS Thott 290 2'') [[Hans Talhoffer]] reported that in spite of Church disapproval, there were nevertheless seven capital crimes that were still commonly accepted as resolvable by means of a judicial duel.</ref> The word duel comes from the Latin 'duellum', cognate with 'bellum', meaning 'war'.\n\n===Renaissance and early modern Europe ===\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], dueling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]] and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes. [[File:Dueling engraving.jpg|thumb|240px|Dueling remained highly popular in European society, despite various attempts at banning the practice.]]\n\nThe first published ''[[code duello]]'', or \"code of dueling\", appeared in [[Renaissance Italy]]. The first formalized national code was [[France]]'s, during the [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the 17th century, duelling had become regarded as a prerogative of the [[aristocracy]], throughout Europe, and attempts to discourage or suppress it generally failed. For example, King [[Louis XIII]] of [[France]] outlawed dueling in 1626, a law which remained in force afterwards, and his successor [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] intensified efforts to wipe out the duel. Despite these efforts, dueling continued unabated, and it is estimated that between 1685 and 1716, French officers fought 10,000 duels, leading to over 400 deaths.<ref>Lynn, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], as late as 1777, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]]. A copy of the code, known as 'The twenty-six commandments', was to be kept in a gentleman's pistol case for reference should a dispute arise regarding procedure.<ref name=\"Hamilton 1829\">{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Joseph |title=The only approved guide through all the stages of a quarrel |publisher=Millikin |location=Dublin |year=1829 |edition=(Internet Archive) |url=https://archive.org/details/onlyapprovedguid00hami |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment-era opposition===\nBy the late 18th century, [[Enlightenment era]] values began to influence society with new self-conscious ideas about [[politeness]], [[civil society|civil behaviour]] and new attitudes towards [[violence]]. The cultivated art of politeness demanded that there should be no outward displays of anger or violence, and the concept of honor became more personalized.\n\nBy the 1770s the practice of dueling was increasingly coming under attack from many sections of enlightened society, as a violent relic of Europe's medieval past unsuited for modern life. As England began to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialize]] and benefit from urban planning and more effective [[Metropolitan police|police forces]], the culture of street violence in general began to slowly wane. The growing [[middle class]] maintained their reputation with recourse to either bringing charges of [[libel]], or to the fast-growing print media of the early 19th century, where they could defend their honor and resolve conflicts through correspondence in newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|title=The Death of Dueling|accessdate=2014-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107223937/http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInfluential new intellectual trends at the turn of the 19th century bolstered the anti-dueling campaign; the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] stressed that praiseworthy actions were exclusively restricted to those that maximize human welfare and happiness, and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] notion of the \"Christian conscience\" began to actively promote social activism. Individuals in the [[Clapham Sect]] and similar societies, who had successfully campaigned for the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], condemned dueling as ungodly violence and as an egocentric culture of honor.<ref>David W.

Between 1798 and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[US Navy]] lost two-thirds as many officers to dueling as it did in combat at sea, including naval hero [[Stephen Decatur]]. Many of those killed or wounded were [[midshipmen]] or junior officers. Despite prominent deaths, dueling persisted because of contemporary ideals of [[chivalry]], particularly in the [[Dueling in the United States South|South]], and because of the threat of ridicule if a challenge was rejected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/dueling.html |title=The American Experience &#124; The Duel &#124; Dueling, American Style |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111235400/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/dueling.html |archive-date=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author=Drake, Ross|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/duel.html|title=Duel!

Military establishments in most countries frowned on dueling because officers were the main contestants. Officers were often trained at military academies at government's expense; when officers killed or disabled one another it imposed an unnecessary financial and leadership strain on a military organization, making dueling unpopular with high-ranking officers.<ref>Holland, Barbara.

[[French Fourth Republic|After World War II]], duels had become rare even in France, and those that still occurred were covered in the press as eccentricities. Duels in France in this period, while still taken seriously as a matter of honor, were not fought to the death. They consisted of fencing with the \u00e9p\u00e9e mostly in a fixed distance with the aim of drawing blood from the opponent's arm.\nIn 1949, former Vichy-official [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]] fought school teacher Roger Nordmann.<ref>\"A French lawyer and a schoolteacher fought a duel today in a meadow near Paris.  Roger Nordmann the schoolteacher was reportedly pricked by the lawyer Jean-Louis Tixier- Vignancour's sword and the duel ended with everyone's honor intact. The feud started three weeks go when. Tixier-Vignancbur challenged Nordmann to a duel with pistols after he said Nordmann insulted him during a treason trial; Nordmann accepted the challenge but said he had never fired anything more potent than . a water pistol. He then chose two of his prettiest girl students, as seconds. The 'lawyer objected on the grounds that a second must be ready to take his principal's place and he could not lift his hand against a woman.

This isn't the \"jousting\" article.-->\nThe custom of \"flinging the gauntlet in the face of another Knight\" is illustrated in early Italian romances such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''\n(The Scots Magazine 89/90 (1822), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fFw3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA575 p. 575]), and the English phrase of  \"throwing down the gauntlet\" occurs in the context of [[Renaissance-era jousting|Tudor-era tournaments]] from the 1540s.\n<!--\nA reference to the supposedly medieval practice is found in the pseudo-medieval poetry of [[Thomas Chatterton]] (''The Tournament: An Interlude'', purportedly written in the 15th century by \"Thomas Rowley\"), ''there's mie gauntlette onn mie gaberdyne.''-->\n</ref>\n\nUsually challenges were delivered in writing by one or more close friends who acted as \"seconds\". The challenge, written in formal language, laid out the real or imagined grievances and a demand for satisfaction. The challenged party then had the choice of accepting or refusing the challenge. Grounds for refusing the challenge could include that it was frivolous, or that the challenger was not generally recognized as a \"gentleman\" since dueling was limited to persons of equal social station. However care had to be taken before declining a challenge, as it could result in accusations of cowardice or be perceived as an insult to the challenger's seconds if it was implied that they were acting on behalf of someone of low social standing. Participation in a duel could be honorably refused on account of a major difference in age between the parties and, to a lesser extent, in cases of social inferiority on the part of the challenger. Such inferiority had to be immediately obvious, however. As author [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] states, \"with social distinctions often difficult to measure,\" most men could not escape on such grounds without the appearance of cowardice.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. Southern Honor: Ethics & Behavior in the Old South. Oxford University Press, 2007, p.355-356</ref>\n\nOnce a challenge was accepted, if not done already, both parties (known as \"principals\") would appoint trusted representatives to act as their seconds with no further direct communication between the principals being allowed until the dispute was settled. The seconds had a number of responsibilities, of which the first was to do all in their power to avert bloodshed provided their principal's honor was not compromised. This could involve back and forth correspondence about a mutually agreeable lesser course of action, such as a formal apology for the alleged offense.\n\nIn the event that the seconds failed to persuade their principals to avoid a fight they then attempted to agree on terms for the duel that would limit the chance of a fatal outcome, consistent with the generally accepted guidelines for affairs of honor. The exact rules or etiquette for dueling varied by time and locale but were usually referred to as the [[code duello]]. In most cases the challenged party had the choice of weapons, with swords being favored in many parts of continental Europe and pistols in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nIt was the job of the seconds to make all of the arrangements in advance, including how long the duel would last and what conditions would end the duel. Often sword duels were only fought until blood was drawn, thus severely limiting the likelihood of death or grave injury since a scratch could be considered as satisfying honor. In pistol duels, the number of shots to be permitted and the range were set out. Care was taken by the seconds to ensure the ground chosen gave no unfair advantage to either party. A doctor or surgeon was usually arranged to be on hand. Other things often arranged by the seconds could go into minute details that might seem odd in the modern world, such as the dress code (duels were often formal affairs), the number and names of any other witnesses to be present and whether or not refreshments would be served.<ref>Lynn, p. 255, 257.</ref>\n\n===Field of honor===\n{{Redirect|Field of honor||Field of Honor (disambiguation){{!}}Field of Honor}}\nThe chief criteria for choosing the field of honor were isolation, to avoid discovery and interruption by the authorities; and jurisdictional ambiguity, to avoid legal consequences. Islands in rivers dividing two jurisdictions were popular dueling sites; the cliffs below Weehawken on the Hudson River where the [[Hamilton-Burr duel]] occurred were a popular field of honor for New York duellists because of the uncertainty whether New York or New Jersey jurisdiction applied. Duels traditionally took place at dawn, when the poor light would make the participants less likely to be seen, and to force an interval for reconsideration or sobering-up.\n\nFor some time before the mid-18th century, swordsmen dueling at dawn often carried lanterns to see each other. This happened so regularly that fencing manuals integrated lanterns into their lessons. An example of this is using the lantern to parry blows and blind the opponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/Angelo.php |title=How to Defend a Monopoly |publisher=Classicalfencing.com |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back, which is still one of the traditional positions for the off hand in modern fencing.<ref>[http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525024932/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png|date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions===\nAt the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions:\n* To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.\n* Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.\n* To the death (or \"\u00e0 l'outrance\"), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.\n* In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied, the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric and, on the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUnder the latter conditions, one or both parties could intentionally miss in order to fulfill the conditions of the duel, without loss of either life or honor. However, doing so, known as [[delope|deloping]], could imply that one's opponent was not worth shooting. This practice occurred despite being expressly banned by the [[Code duello|Code Duello]] of 1777. Rule XII stated: \"No dumb shooting or firing in the air is admissible in any case... children's play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904223840/http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\nPractices varied, however, but unless the challenger was of a higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in the duel. The offended party could stop the duel at any time if he deemed his honor satisfied. In some duels, the seconds would take the place of the primary dueller if the primary was not able to finish the duel. This was usually done in duels with swords, where one's expertise was sometimes limited. The second would also act as a witness.\n\n===Pistol duel===\n[[File:Yevgeny Onegin by Repin.jpg|thumb|right|The fictional pistol duel between [[Eugene Onegin]] and Vladimir Lensky. Watercolour by [[Ilya Repin]] (1899)]]\nFor a pistol duel, the two would typically start at a pre-agreed length of ground, which would be measured out by the seconds and marked, often with swords stuck in the ground (referred to as \"points\"). At a given signal, often the dropping of a handkerchief, the principals could advance and fire at will. This latter system reduced the possibility of cheating, as neither principal had to trust the other not to turn too soon. Another system involved alternate shots being taken, beginning with the challenged firing first.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMany historical duels were prevented by the difficulty of arranging the ''\"methodus pugnandi\"''.

These stressed the need to protect one's reputation and social mask and prescribed the circumstances under which an insulted party should issue a challenge.\nThe word ''duel'' was introduced in the 1590s, modelled after [[Medieval Latin]] ''duellum'' (an archaic Latin form of ''bellum'' \"war\", but associated by popular etymology with ''duo'' \"two\", hence  \"one-on-one combat\").<ref>This usage apparently goes back to [[John of Legnano]], author of a 14th-century work on dueling, ''De Bello'', cited by [[du Cange]]\n''Pugna corporalis deliberata hinc inde duorum, ad purgationem, gloriam, vel odii aggregationem.''\n[http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/DUELLUM3 3.

Dueling was further propagated by the arrival of Italian fencing masters such as Rocco Bonetti and Vincento Saviolo. By the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] dueling was well entrenched within a militarised peerage&nbsp;\u2013 one of the most important duels being that between [[Lord Kinloss|Edward Bruce, 2nd Lord Kinloss]] and [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset|Edward Sackville]] (later the 4th Earl of Dorset) in 1613, during which Bruce was killed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DgEOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=Lord+Bruce+Earl+of+Dorset+1613+duel#v=onepage&q=Lord%20Bruce%20Earl%20of%20Dorset%201613%20duel&f=false|title=The Duel: A History of Duelling|first=Robert|last=Baldick|publisher=Chapman & Hall|year=1965|accessdate=19 April 2011|isbn=9780600328377}}</ref> James I encouraged [[Francis Bacon]] as Solicitor-General to prosecute would-be duellists in the [[Court of Star Chamber]], leading to about two hundred prosecutions between 1603 and 1625. He also issued an edict against dueling in 1614 and is believed to have supported production of an anti-dueling tract by the [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]]. Dueling however, continued to spread out from the court, notably into the army. In the mid-17th century it was for a time checked by the activities of the Parliamentarians whose Articles of War specified the death penalty for would-be duellists. Nevertheless, dueling survived and increased markedly with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Among the difficulties of anti-dueling campaigners was that although monarchs uniformly proclaimed their general hostility to dueling, they were nevertheless very reluctant to see their own favourites punished. In 1712 both the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] and [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Charles 4th Baron Mohun]] were killed in a [[Hamilton\u2013Mohun Duel|celebrated duel]] induced by political rivalry and squabbles over an inheritance.\n\nBy the 1780s, the values of the duel had spread into the broader and emerging society of gentlemen. Research shows that much the largest group of later duellists were military officers, followed by the young sons of the metropolitan elite (see Banks, ''A Polite Exchange of Bullets''). Dueling was also popular for a time among doctors and, in particular, in the legal professions. Quantifying the number of duels in Britain is difficult, but there are about 1,000 attested between 1785 and 1845 with fatality rates at least 15% and probably somewhat higher. The last duel in England was fought in 1852 between two French political exiles.<ref name=KEG/>\n\nIn 1777, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels.

Dueling quickly became so popular \u2013 and the number of casualties among the commanding ranks so high \u2013 that, in 1715, Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the First]] was forced to forbid the practice on pain of having both duellists hanged. Despite this official ban, dueling became a significant military tradition in the Russian Empire with a detailed unwritten [[w:ru:\u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441|dueling code]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was eventually written down by V. Durasov and released in print in 1908.<ref>V. Durasov \"The Dueling Code\" {{ISBN|5-7905-1634-3}}</ref> This code forbade duels between people of different [[Table of Ranks|ranks]]. For instance, an infantry captain could not challenge a major but could easily pick on a Titular Counsellor. On the other hand, a higher ranked person could not stoop to challenge lower ranks; so, it was up to his subordinates or servants to take revenge on their master's behalf.\n\nDueling was also common among prominent Russian writers, poets, and politicians. Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] fought 29 duels, challenging many prominent figures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-push.net/ |title=Pushkin duels.

In [[Argentina]], during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for ''[[gaucho]]s''\u2014cowboys\u2014to resolve their disputes in a fight using working knives called ''[[Fac\u00f3n|facones]]''. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the fac\u00f3n as a close-combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly as a tool. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments \"of honor\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping when one could no longer see clearly through the blood.\n\nIn Peru there were several high-profile duels by politicians in the early part of the 20th century including one in 1957 involving [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]], who went on to become President.

Second, because of this congruence between upper and lower concepts of [[honor]], dueling was not at all undemocratic. It enabled lesser men to enter, however imperfectly, the ranks of leaders, and allowed followers to manipulate leaders to their taste.

Many [[kshatriya]] considered it shameful to die in bed, and in their old age often arranged for a ''yuddha-dhan'', literally meaning \"combat charity\". According to this practice when a warrior felt he did not have much time to live, he would go along with a few attendants and ask another king for a duel or a small scale battle. In this way he chooses his own time and manner of death and is assured that he will die fighting. Duels to the death were legal in some periods, and punishable by execution in others.<ref name=Auboyer>{{cite book |title=Daily Life in Ancient India |author=Jeanine Auboyer |year=1965 |pp=58 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=France}}</ref>\n\nAncient epics and texts like the ''[[Dharmashastra]]'' tell that duels took place under strict rules of conduct, and to violate them was both shameful and sinful. According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The ''[[Manusm\u1e5bti]]'' tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duellists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University|author=Kaushik Roy}}</ref> In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.<ref name=Auboyer/>\n\nThe Portuguese traveller [[Duarte Barbosa]] tells that dueling was a common practice among the nobles of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], and it was the only legal manner in which \"murder\" could be committed. After fixing a day for the duel and getting permission from the king or minister, the duellists would arrive at the appointed field \"with great pleasure\". Duellists would wear no armour and were bare from the waist up. From the waist down they wore cotton cloth tightly round with many folds. The weapons used for dueling were swords, shields and daggers which the king would appoint them of equal length. Judges decided what rewards would be given to duellists; the winner may even acquire the loser's estate.<ref>{{cite book |title= Travels of Duerte Barbosa |author=M.L. Dames |year=1918 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuels in [[Manipur]] were first recorded in the ''Chainarol-Puya'' which details the ethics of dueling. When a fighter was challenged, the day for the bout would be fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death, and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was still expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser's body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Various taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn [[Kerala]], duels known as [[ankam]] were fought by the [[kalari]]-trained [[Chekavar]] caste on behalf of their local rulers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=Chekavan+|title= Communal Road to a Secular Kerala.Page 30|work=George Mathew|publisher=Concept Pub.Co, 1989|isbn=978-81-7022-282-8|accessdate=2007-12-28|year= 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xNAI9F8IBOgC&pg=PA27&dq=Chekavar+Sevakan|title= Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia.Page 27|work=Bardwell L.

When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other within the confined space of a single sarong.<ref name=\"Sitobo Lalang Lipa\">{{cite web |url=http://mirror.unpad.ac.id/koran/mediaindonesia/2010-09-18/mediaindonesia_2010-09-18_021.pdf |title=Tomanurung Perang Sejati Orang Bugis |publisher=Media Indonesia |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike the more typical [[kris]] duel of Javanese and Malay culture, the Bugis-Makassar community instead wield [[badik]], the local single-edge knife.

The offender would have the choice whether to accept or decline the challenge. In the past, choice of weapons was not limited. But most often, [[Bolo knife|bolos]], rattan canes, and knives were the preferred weapons. Duels were either first-blood, submission, or to the last man standing. Duels to death were known as ''huego-todo'' (without bounds).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The older generation of [[Filipino martial art]]ists still tell of duels which occurred during their youth.\n\nDuels with the [[bolo knife]] were prominent in North and Central Philippines, common in farmlands where the machete-like bolo is commonly used as a domestic tool. A duel reported internationally occurred on 14 April 1920 by Prescott Journal Miner which was known as \"The First Bolo Duel in Manila since the American Occupation\". It happened when \u00c1ngel Umali and Tranquilino Paglinawan met with friends in a vacant lot near the city centre before dusk to settle a feud; Paglinawan lost his left hand.

Duels in this form were chiefly practiced in [[early modern Europe]] with precedents in the medieval code of [[chivalry]], and continued into the modern period (18th to late 19th centuries, if not beyond) especially among [[Officer (armed forces)|military officers]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), duels were mostly fought with [[sword]]s (the [[rapier]], and later the [[small sword]]), but beginning in the late 18th century in [[England]], duels were more commonly fought using [[pistol]]s. [[Fencing]] and pistol duels continued to co-exist throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe duel was based on a code of [[honour|honor]]. Duels were fought not so much to kill the opponent as to gain \"satisfaction\", that is, to restore one's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one's life for it, and as such the tradition of dueling was originally reserved for the male members of [[nobility]]; however, in the modern era it extended to those of the [[upper classes]] generally. On occasion, duels with [[pistol]]s or swords were fought between women.<ref>Hopton, p.182</ref><ref>Hopton, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nLegislation against dueling goes back to the medieval period. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) outlawed duels,<ref>IV Lateran c. 18, Peter R. Coss, ''The Moral World of the Law'',  Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 78</ref> and civil legislation in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against dueling was passed in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=\"Liszt\"/>\nFrom the early 17th century, duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced. Dueling largely fell out of favor in England by the mid-19th century and in [[Continental Europe]] by the turn of the 20th century. Dueling declined in the [[Eastern United States]] in the 19th century and by the time the [[American Civil War]] broke out, dueling had begun to wane even in the \n[[Southern United States|South]].<ref name=uuooooav>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/sfeature/dueling.html The History of Dueling in America] PBS.org, Accessed February 8, 2014</ref> Public opinion, not legislation, caused the change.<ref name=uuooooav />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and Middle Ages===\n[[File:Gerichtlicher Zweikampf.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a judicial combat in the Dresden codex of the ''Sachsenspiegel'' (early to mid-14th century), illustrating the provision that the two combatants must \"share the sun\", i.e. align themselves perpendicular to the Sun so that neither has an advantage.]]\n{{Further|Single combat}}\n[[File:Manifesto disfida di barletta.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative poster for the fourth centennial of the ''Disfida di Barletta'', the [[Challenge of Barletta]], fought on 13 February 1503 between 13 Italian and 13 French [[knights]] all shown wearing full [[plate armour]].]]\n\nIn [[Western world|Western]] society, the formal concept of a duel developed out of the [[mediaeval|medieval]] [[judicial duel]] and older pre-Christian practices such as the [[Viking Age]] ''[[holmgang]]''. In Medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Boydell Press (November 18, 2010). pp. 157-160. {{ISBN|978-1843835967}}</ref> Countries like [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Ireland]] practiced this tradition. Judicial combat took two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms was used to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The battle was fought as a result of a slight or challenge to one party's [[honor]] which could not be resolved by a court. Weapons were standardized and typical of a knight's armoury, for example longswords, polearms etc., however, weapon quality and augmentations were at the discretion of the knight, for example, a spiked hand guard or an extra grip for half-swording. The parties involved would wear their own armour; for example, one knight wearing full plate might face another wearing chain mail. The duel lasted until one party could no longer fight back. In early cases, the defeated party was then executed. This type of duel soon evolved into the more [[Chivalry|chivalric]] ''[[pas d'armes]],'' or \"passage of arms\", a chivalric [[hastilude]] that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. A knight or group of knights (''tenans'' or \"holders\") would stake out a travelled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass (''venans'' or \"comers\") must first fight, or be disgraced.<ref>Hubbard, Ben. ''Gladiators: From Spartacus to Spitfires''. Canary Press (August 15, 2011). Chapter: Pas D'armes. ASIN: B005HJTS8O.</ref> If a traveling ''venans'' did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the ''venans'' chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] was critical of dueling throughout medieval history, frowning both on the traditions of [[judicial combat]] and on the duel on points of [[honour|honor]] among the nobility.\nJudicial duels were deprecated by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215, but the judicial duel persisted in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into the 15th century.<ref>\nIn 1459 (''MS Thott 290 2'') [[Hans Talhoffer]] reported that in spite of Church disapproval, there were nevertheless seven capital crimes that were still commonly accepted as resolvable by means of a judicial duel.</ref> The word duel comes from the Latin 'duellum', cognate with 'bellum', meaning 'war'.\n\n===Renaissance and early modern Europe ===\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], dueling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]] and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes. [[File:Dueling engraving.jpg|thumb|240px|Dueling remained highly popular in European society, despite various attempts at banning the practice.]]\n\nThe first published ''[[code duello]]'', or \"code of dueling\", appeared in [[Renaissance Italy]]. The first formalized national code was [[France]]'s, during the [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the 17th century, duelling had become regarded as a prerogative of the [[aristocracy]], throughout Europe, and attempts to discourage or suppress it generally failed. For example, King [[Louis XIII]] of [[France]] outlawed dueling in 1626, a law which remained in force afterwards, and his successor [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] intensified efforts to wipe out the duel. Despite these efforts, dueling continued unabated, and it is estimated that between 1685 and 1716, French officers fought 10,000 duels, leading to over 400 deaths.<ref>Lynn, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], as late as 1777, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]].

The cultivated art of politeness demanded that there should be no outward displays of anger or violence, and the concept of honor became more personalized.\n\nBy the 1770s the practice of dueling was increasingly coming under attack from many sections of enlightened society, as a violent relic of Europe's medieval past unsuited for modern life. As England began to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialize]] and benefit from urban planning and more effective [[Metropolitan police|police forces]], the culture of street violence in general began to slowly wane. The growing [[middle class]] maintained their reputation with recourse to either bringing charges of [[libel]], or to the fast-growing print media of the early 19th century, where they could defend their honor and resolve conflicts through correspondence in newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|title=The Death of Dueling|accessdate=2014-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107223937/http://castle.eiu.edu/historia/archives/2004/Ellett.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInfluential new intellectual trends at the turn of the 19th century bolstered the anti-dueling campaign; the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] stressed that praiseworthy actions were exclusively restricted to those that maximize human welfare and happiness, and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] notion of the \"Christian conscience\" began to actively promote social activism. Individuals in the [[Clapham Sect]] and similar societies, who had successfully campaigned for the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]], condemned dueling as ungodly violence and as an egocentric culture of honor.<ref>David W.

This isn't the \"jousting\" article.-->\nThe custom of \"flinging the gauntlet in the face of another Knight\" is illustrated in early Italian romances such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''\n(The Scots Magazine 89/90 (1822), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fFw3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA575 p. 575]), and the English phrase of  \"throwing down the gauntlet\" occurs in the context of [[Renaissance-era jousting|Tudor-era tournaments]] from the 1540s.\n<!--\nA reference to the supposedly medieval practice is found in the pseudo-medieval poetry of [[Thomas Chatterton]] (''The Tournament: An Interlude'', purportedly written in the 15th century by \"Thomas Rowley\"), ''there's mie gauntlette onn mie gaberdyne.''-->\n</ref>\n\nUsually challenges were delivered in writing by one or more close friends who acted as \"seconds\". The challenge, written in formal language, laid out the real or imagined grievances and a demand for satisfaction. The challenged party then had the choice of accepting or refusing the challenge. Grounds for refusing the challenge could include that it was frivolous, or that the challenger was not generally recognized as a \"gentleman\" since dueling was limited to persons of equal social station. However care had to be taken before declining a challenge, as it could result in accusations of cowardice or be perceived as an insult to the challenger's seconds if it was implied that they were acting on behalf of someone of low social standing. Participation in a duel could be honorably refused on account of a major difference in age between the parties and, to a lesser extent, in cases of social inferiority on the part of the challenger. Such inferiority had to be immediately obvious, however. As author [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] states, \"with social distinctions often difficult to measure,\" most men could not escape on such grounds without the appearance of cowardice.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. Southern Honor: Ethics & Behavior in the Old South. Oxford University Press, 2007, p.355-356</ref>\n\nOnce a challenge was accepted, if not done already, both parties (known as \"principals\") would appoint trusted representatives to act as their seconds with no further direct communication between the principals being allowed until the dispute was settled. The seconds had a number of responsibilities, of which the first was to do all in their power to avert bloodshed provided their principal's honor was not compromised. This could involve back and forth correspondence about a mutually agreeable lesser course of action, such as a formal apology for the alleged offense.\n\nIn the event that the seconds failed to persuade their principals to avoid a fight they then attempted to agree on terms for the duel that would limit the chance of a fatal outcome, consistent with the generally accepted guidelines for affairs of honor. The exact rules or etiquette for dueling varied by time and locale but were usually referred to as the [[code duello]]. In most cases the challenged party had the choice of weapons, with swords being favored in many parts of continental Europe and pistols in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nIt was the job of the seconds to make all of the arrangements in advance, including how long the duel would last and what conditions would end the duel. Often sword duels were only fought until blood was drawn, thus severely limiting the likelihood of death or grave injury since a scratch could be considered as satisfying honor. In pistol duels, the number of shots to be permitted and the range were set out. Care was taken by the seconds to ensure the ground chosen gave no unfair advantage to either party. A doctor or surgeon was usually arranged to be on hand. Other things often arranged by the seconds could go into minute details that might seem odd in the modern world, such as the dress code (duels were often formal affairs), the number and names of any other witnesses to be present and whether or not refreshments would be served.<ref>Lynn, p. 255, 257.</ref>\n\n===Field of honor===\n{{Redirect|Field of honor||Field of Honor (disambiguation){{!}}Field of Honor}}\nThe chief criteria for choosing the field of honor were isolation, to avoid discovery and interruption by the authorities; and jurisdictional ambiguity, to avoid legal consequences. Islands in rivers dividing two jurisdictions were popular dueling sites; the cliffs below Weehawken on the Hudson River where the [[Hamilton-Burr duel]] occurred were a popular field of honor for New York duellists because of the uncertainty whether New York or New Jersey jurisdiction applied. Duels traditionally took place at dawn, when the poor light would make the participants less likely to be seen, and to force an interval for reconsideration or sobering-up.\n\nFor some time before the mid-18th century, swordsmen dueling at dawn often carried lanterns to see each other. This happened so regularly that fencing manuals integrated lanterns into their lessons. An example of this is using the lantern to parry blows and blind the opponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/Angelo.php |title=How to Defend a Monopoly |publisher=Classicalfencing.com |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back, which is still one of the traditional positions for the off hand in modern fencing.<ref>[http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525024932/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/blyle/Angelo/46.png|date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions===\nAt the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions:\n* To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.\n* Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.\n* To the death (or \"\u00e0 l'outrance\"), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.\n* In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied, the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric and, on the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUnder the latter conditions, one or both parties could intentionally miss in order to fulfill the conditions of the duel, without loss of either life or honor. However, doing so, known as [[delope|deloping]], could imply that one's opponent was not worth shooting. This practice occurred despite being expressly banned by the [[Code duello|Code Duello]] of 1777. Rule XII stated: \"No dumb shooting or firing in the air is admissible in any case... children's play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904223840/http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/CodeDuello.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\nPractices varied, however, but unless the challenger was of a higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in the duel. The offended party could stop the duel at any time if he deemed his honor satisfied. In some duels, the seconds would take the place of the primary dueller if the primary was not able to finish the duel. This was usually done in duels with swords, where one's expertise was sometimes limited. The second would also act as a witness.\n\n===Pistol duel===\n[[File:Yevgeny Onegin by Repin.jpg|thumb|right|The fictional pistol duel between [[Eugene Onegin]] and Vladimir Lensky. Watercolour by [[Ilya Repin]] (1899)]]\nFor a pistol duel, the two would typically start at a pre-agreed length of ground, which would be measured out by the seconds and marked, often with swords stuck in the ground (referred to as \"points\"). At a given signal, often the dropping of a handkerchief, the principals could advance and fire at will. This latter system reduced the possibility of cheating, as neither principal had to trust the other not to turn too soon. Another system involved alternate shots being taken, beginning with the challenged firing first.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMany historical duels were prevented by the difficulty of arranging the ''\"methodus pugnandi\"''.

These stressed the need to protect one's reputation and social mask and prescribed the circumstances under which an insulted party should issue a challenge.\nThe word ''duel'' was introduced in the 1590s, modelled after [[Medieval Latin]] ''duellum'' (an archaic Latin form of ''bellum'' \"war\", but associated by popular etymology with ''duo'' \"two\", hence  \"one-on-one combat\").<ref>This usage apparently goes back to [[John of Legnano]], author of a 14th-century work on dueling, ''De Bello'', cited by [[du Cange]]\n''Pugna corporalis deliberata hinc inde duorum, ad purgationem, gloriam, vel odii aggregationem.''\n[http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/DUELLUM3 3.

Dueling was further propagated by the arrival of Italian fencing masters such as Rocco Bonetti and Vincento Saviolo. By the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] dueling was well entrenched within a militarised peerage&nbsp;\u2013 one of the most important duels being that between [[Lord Kinloss|Edward Bruce, 2nd Lord Kinloss]] and [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset|Edward Sackville]] (later the 4th Earl of Dorset) in 1613, during which Bruce was killed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DgEOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=Lord+Bruce+Earl+of+Dorset+1613+duel#v=onepage&q=Lord%20Bruce%20Earl%20of%20Dorset%201613%20duel&f=false|title=The Duel: A History of Duelling|first=Robert|last=Baldick|publisher=Chapman & Hall|year=1965|accessdate=19 April 2011|isbn=9780600328377}}</ref> James I encouraged [[Francis Bacon]] as Solicitor-General to prosecute would-be duellists in the [[Court of Star Chamber]], leading to about two hundred prosecutions between 1603 and 1625. He also issued an edict against dueling in 1614 and is believed to have supported production of an anti-dueling tract by the [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]]. Dueling however, continued to spread out from the court, notably into the army. In the mid-17th century it was for a time checked by the activities of the Parliamentarians whose Articles of War specified the death penalty for would-be duellists. Nevertheless, dueling survived and increased markedly with the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Among the difficulties of anti-dueling campaigners was that although monarchs uniformly proclaimed their general hostility to dueling, they were nevertheless very reluctant to see their own favourites punished. In 1712 both the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] and [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Charles 4th Baron Mohun]] were killed in a [[Hamilton\u2013Mohun Duel|celebrated duel]] induced by political rivalry and squabbles over an inheritance.\n\nBy the 1780s, the values of the duel had spread into the broader and emerging society of gentlemen. Research shows that much the largest group of later duellists were military officers, followed by the young sons of the metropolitan elite (see Banks, ''A Polite Exchange of Bullets''). Dueling was also popular for a time among doctors and, in particular, in the legal professions. Quantifying the number of duels in Britain is difficult, but there are about 1,000 attested between 1785 and 1845 with fatality rates at least 15% and probably somewhat higher. The last duel in England was fought in 1852 between two French political exiles.<ref name=KEG/>\n\nIn 1777, at the Summer [[assize]]s in the town of [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels.

In the 15th century, duels were fought between members of the nobility wearing full [[plate armour]]. During the late 16th and the 17th century, this tradition was gradually replaced with the modern fencing with the rapier following the [[Dardi school]], while at the same time the practice of dueling spread to the [[bourgeois]] classes, especially among [[academic fencing|students]].\n\nThe term ''Kampf'' is replaced by the modern German ''Duell'' during the same period, attested in the Latin form ''duellum'' from ca. 1600, and as ''Duell'' from the 1640s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologisches00klug |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache : Kluge, Friedrich, 1856-1926 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2012-10-22|publisher=Strassburg, Tr\u00fcbner }}</ref>\nA modern remnant of German dueling culture is found in the non-lethal [[Mensur]] tradition in [[Academic fencing]].\n\n====Greece====\nIn the [[Ionian Islands]] in the 19th century, there was a practice of formalised fighting between men over points of honor.\nKnives were the weapons used in such fights.

As soon as blood was drawn onlookers would intervene to separate the men.

Dueling quickly became so popular \u2013 and the number of casualties among the commanding ranks so high \u2013 that, in 1715, Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the First]] was forced to forbid the practice on pain of having both duellists hanged. Despite this official ban, dueling became a significant military tradition in the Russian Empire with a detailed unwritten [[w:ru:\u0414\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441|dueling code]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was eventually written down by V. Durasov and released in print in 1908.<ref>V. Durasov \"The Dueling Code\" {{ISBN|5-7905-1634-3}}</ref> This code forbade duels between people of different [[Table of Ranks|ranks]]. For instance, an infantry captain could not challenge a major but could easily pick on a Titular Counsellor. On the other hand, a higher ranked person could not stoop to challenge lower ranks; so, it was up to his subordinates or servants to take revenge on their master's behalf.\n\nDueling was also common among prominent Russian writers, poets, and politicians. Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] fought 29 duels, challenging many prominent figures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-push.net/ |title=Pushkin duels. Full list|publisher=D-push.net|accessdate=2012-10-22|language=ru}}</ref> before being killed in a duel with [[Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]] in 1837.

In [[Argentina]], during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for ''[[gaucho]]s''\u2014cowboys\u2014to resolve their disputes in a fight using working knives called ''[[Fac\u00f3n|facones]]''. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the fac\u00f3n as a close-combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly as a tool. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments \"of honor\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping when one could no longer see clearly through the blood.\n\nIn Peru there were several high-profile duels by politicians in the early part of the 20th century including one in 1957 involving [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]], who went on to become President.

Three ironies emerged from the dueling custom. First, though confined to a segment of the upper classes, dueling served essentially the same purpose as the lowest eye-gouging battle among [[Tennessee]] hog drivers. Second, because of this congruence between upper and lower concepts of [[honor]], dueling was not at all undemocratic. It enabled lesser men to enter, however imperfectly, the ranks of leaders, and allowed followers to manipulate leaders to their taste. Third, the promise of esteem and status that beckoned men to the field of honor did not always match the expectation, but often enough dueling served as a form of [[scapegoating]] for unresolved personal problems.<ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram. 1982.

Many [[kshatriya]] considered it shameful to die in bed, and in their old age often arranged for a ''yuddha-dhan'', literally meaning \"combat charity\". According to this practice when a warrior felt he did not have much time to live, he would go along with a few attendants and ask another king for a duel or a small scale battle. In this way he chooses his own time and manner of death and is assured that he will die fighting. Duels to the death were legal in some periods, and punishable by execution in others.<ref name=Auboyer>{{cite book |title=Daily Life in Ancient India |author=Jeanine Auboyer |year=1965 |pp=58 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=France}}</ref>\n\nAncient epics and texts like the ''[[Dharmashastra]]'' tell that duels took place under strict rules of conduct, and to violate them was both shameful and sinful. According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The ''[[Manusm\u1e5bti]]'' tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duellists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University|author=Kaushik Roy}}</ref> In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.<ref name=Auboyer/>\n\nThe Portuguese traveller [[Duarte Barbosa]] tells that dueling was a common practice among the nobles of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], and it was the only legal manner in which \"murder\" could be committed. After fixing a day for the duel and getting permission from the king or minister, the duellists would arrive at the appointed field \"with great pleasure\". Duellists would wear no armour and were bare from the waist up. From the waist down they wore cotton cloth tightly round with many folds. The weapons used for dueling were swords, shields and daggers which the king would appoint them of equal length. Judges decided what rewards would be given to duellists; the winner may even acquire the loser's estate.<ref>{{cite book |title= Travels of Duerte Barbosa |author=M.L. Dames |year=1918 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nDuels in [[Manipur]] were first recorded in the ''Chainarol-Puya'' which details the ethics of dueling. When a fighter was challenged, the day for the bout would be fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death, and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was still expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser's body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Various taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn [[Kerala]], duels known as [[ankam]] were fought by the [[kalari]]-trained [[Chekavar]] caste on behalf of their local rulers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=Chekavan+|title= Communal Road to a Secular Kerala.Page 30|work=George Mathew|publisher=Concept Pub.Co, 1989|isbn=978-81-7022-282-8|accessdate=2007-12-28|year= 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xNAI9F8IBOgC&pg=PA27&dq=Chekavar+Sevakan|title= Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia.Page 27|work=Bardwell L.

In [[Madura Island|Madura]], dueling is known as ''carok'' and was typically practiced with the sickle or [[celurit]].

The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and respectfully invites the other man to step into the sarong. The sarong itself is kept taut around both their waists. When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other within the confined space of a single sarong.<ref name=\"Sitobo Lalang Lipa\">{{cite web |url=http://mirror.unpad.ac.id/koran/mediaindonesia/2010-09-18/mediaindonesia_2010-09-18_021.pdf |title=Tomanurung Perang Sejati Orang Bugis |publisher=Media Indonesia |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Unlike the more typical [[kris]] duel of Javanese and Malay culture, the Bugis-Makassar community instead wield [[badik]], the local single-edge knife.

The offender would have the choice whether to accept or decline the challenge. In the past, choice of weapons was not limited. But most often, [[Bolo knife|bolos]], rattan canes, and knives were the preferred weapons. Duels were either first-blood, submission, or to the last man standing. Duels to death were known as ''huego-todo'' (without bounds).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The older generation of [[Filipino martial art]]ists still tell of duels which occurred during their youth.\n\nDuels with the [[bolo knife]] were prominent in North and Central Philippines, common in farmlands where the machete-like bolo is commonly used as a domestic tool. A duel reported internationally occurred on 14 April 1920 by Prescott Journal Miner which was known as \"The First Bolo Duel in Manila since the American Occupation\". It happened when \u00c1ngel Umali and Tranquilino Paglinawan met with friends in a vacant lot near the city centre before dusk to settle a feud; Paglinawan lost his left hand.

The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.\n\nThe actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.\n\nAlthough Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]], they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|title=Balance of power in presidential race|date=22 May 2007|publisher=[[NDTV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007104210/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|archivedate=7 October 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Oath or affirmation===\nThe president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the [[Chief Justice of India]]\u2014or in his absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court\u2014an oath or affirmation that he/she shall protect, preserve and defend the constitution as follows:<ref name=\"Pratiyogita Darpan 0 google books\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT67|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|author=Pratiyogita Darpan|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=67|accessdate=31 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135406/http://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT67|archivedate=8 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law, and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of India.|[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 60 .7BOath or affirmation by the President.7D|Article 60]], Constitution of India}}\n\n==Emoluments==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1ex 0 1ex 1ex;\"\n\n|+ '''Presidential pay'''\n!

In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n===Proving majority in the parliament===\n{{main|Vote of confidence}}\n\nIn 1979, Prime Minister [[Charan Singh]], did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament.<ref name=\"Darpan2007\"/> Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.\n\n===Proof of Majority to form a Government===\nSince the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister prove he has the support of the [[Lok Sabha]] (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/10/stories/2005111003281400.htm|title=K.R.

If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President [[A. P. J.

The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.\n\nThe actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.\n\nAlthough Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]], they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|title=Balance of power in presidential race|date=22 May 2007|publisher=[[NDTV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007104210/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|archivedate=7 October 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Oath or affirmation===\nThe president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the [[Chief Justice of India]]\u2014or in his absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court\u2014an oath or affirmation that he/she shall protect, preserve and defend the constitution as follows:<ref name=\"Pratiyogita Darpan 0 google books\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT67|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|author=Pratiyogita Darpan|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=67|accessdate=31 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135406/http://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT67|archivedate=8 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law, and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of India.|[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 60 .7BOath or affirmation by the President.7D|Article 60]], Constitution of India}}\n\n==Emoluments==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1ex 0 1ex 1ex;\"\n\n|+ '''Presidential pay'''\n!

He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament.<ref name=\"Darpan2007\"/> Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.\n\n===Proof of Majority to form a Government===\nSince the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister prove he has the support of the [[Lok Sabha]] (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/10/stories/2005111003281400.htm|title=K.R.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

{"title_page": "As the Stomach Turns", "text_new": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring.

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials).

In 1943, Vlasov gave Kromiadi command of his headquarters. Kromiadi made several attempts to attract white \u00e9migr\u00e9s to General Vlasov, and was finally successful by the time of the [[Prague Manifesto]], having secured the support of two branches of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nKromiadi's point of view was that the [[Russian Liberation Army]] was a 30-year Christian liberation war against Communism.<ref> 2018 Traitors, Collaborators and Deserters in Contemporary European Politics of Memory Forms of Betrayal Editors: Grinchenko, Gelinada, Narvselius, Eleonora (Eds.)

Entries on this list must meet three criteria:\n# They are active movements with active members;\n# They are seeking greater autonomy or [[self-determination]] for a geographic region (as opposed to [[National personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]);\n# They are citizens/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from another country.\n\nUnder each region listed is one or more of the following:\n* ''De facto'' state (de facto entity): for [[Diplomatic recognition|unrecognized]] regions with de facto autonomy;\n* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state;\n* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession;\n** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region;\n** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control;\n** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession;\n** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations;\n** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]];\n** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s).\n\nVarious ethnic groups in Europe are seeking greater autonomy or independence. In the [[European Union]] (EU), several of these groups are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA). In some cases, the group seeks to unify into a different state \u2013 in cases where this does not involve the creation of a new state entity, this is considered to be [[irredentism]]. Analogous irredentist movements are included in the [[list of active irredentist movements]].\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Azerbaijan==\n[[File:Location Nagorno-Karabakh en.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Location of

Entries on this list must meet three criteria:\n# They are active movements with active members;\n# They are seeking greater autonomy or [[self-determination]] for a geographic region (as opposed to [[National personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]);\n# They are citizens/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from another country.\n\nUnder each region listed is one or more of the following:\n* ''De facto'' state (de facto entity): for [[Diplomatic recognition|unrecognized]] regions with de facto autonomy;\n* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state;\n* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession;\n** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region;\n** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control;\n** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession;\n** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations;\n** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]];\n** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s).\n\nVarious ethnic groups in Europe are seeking greater autonomy or independence. In the [[European Union]] (EU), several of these groups are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA). In some cases, the group seeks to unify into a different state \u2013 in cases where this does not involve the creation of a new state entity, this is considered to be [[irredentism]].
