The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]],'' released in December 1993.<ref name=\"MeMyselfBob\">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

His first animation model was an [[anthropomorphic]] candy bar. When his wife suggested that parents might prefer a hero who promoted [[healthy diet|healthier eating habit]]s, he began designing the characters based on fruits and vegetables. The cast of voice actors of the early VeggieTales videos predominantly came from friends of Phil Vischer such as Dan Anderson ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]]) and Jim Poole ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Scooter|Scooter the Carrot]]) who collaborated with Vischer on dramas at their local church.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Episode 200: THE BIG 2-0-0!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzD_J03KcuY|via=YouTube|accessdate=January 22, 2017|date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Softimage 3D was used for further episodes until 1999 when it was replaced with [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Noell Wolfgram|title=VeggieTales: What's the Big Idea?|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Features/bigideap.html|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=Digital Media FX|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n[[Lyrick Studios]] sued Big Idea in January 2002 claiming Big Idea \"abruptly walked away\" from a 1997 deal to manufacture and distribute VeggieTales merchandise.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/01/21/story1.html|title=Lawsuit over verbal pact pits Lyrick Studios, VeggieTales|last=Patrick|first=Stephanie|work=[[Dallas Business Journal]]|date=January 20, 2002|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref> Big Idea, which had no written contract, made a new deal with [[Warner Home Video]].

Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.

Their aim was to produce children's videos which conveyed Christian moral themes and taught Biblical values and lessons. The animated feature involved stories told by a group of recurring fruit and vegetable characters who lived on a kitchen countertop. The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]],'' released in December 1993.<ref name=\"MeMyselfBob\">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

The ''Silly Songs'' are generally introduced with a [[title card]] and a [[voice-over]] saying, \"And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song.\" Some ''Silly Songs'' have alternate titles, such as \"Love Songs with Mr. Lunt,\" or \"Ukulele Karaoke with Bob,\" where another character sings the song instead.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales {{!}} Monkey Silly Song {{!}} Silly Songs With Larry {{!}} Kids Cartoon {{!}} Kids Videos {{!}} Kids Movies|date=April 30, 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv9YwNGUSSU|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> The ''Silly Song'', if one appears, is usually in the middle of the program, often at a [[cliffhanger]] moment or in between two stories (although the LarryBoy videos, in particular, often lack this segment, with the exception of ''League of Incredible Vegetables'').

Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.
