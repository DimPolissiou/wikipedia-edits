The ship was to have been the first {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}}-long ocean liner. She was intended to be the largest ocean liner for the White Star Line, thus she would have been larger than the earlier White Star giants, [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']], and [[RMS Majestic (1914)|''Majestic.'']]\n\n[[File:RMMV OCEANIC III Day version.jpg|thumb|Digital drawing representing the ''Oceanic''|left]]\n== History ==\nSeveral sets of plans for the ship's design were produced by Harland and Wolff for ''Oceanic'' between 1926 and 1930. One set, submitted in January 1926, showed a {{convert|900|ft|m|adj=on}}-long four-funnel liner. Another set, drawn later the same year, showed a 935 feet long and 100 feet wide liner with three funnels. It was roughly the same size as [[SS Europa (1928)|''Europa'']] and [[SS Bremen (1928)|''Bremen'']]. The final set showed the current {{convert|1,050|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} design with three funnels and cruiser stern typical of liners being built in the mid to late 1920s.\n\nThe order was placed on 18 June 1928 and construction began on 28 June 1928, when her keel was laid. The work was slowed by a dispute over her powerplant; Lord Kylsant which controlled the White Star Line wanted to use [[diesel-electric]] instead of the traditional [[Steamboat|steam]] power. White Star proposed having over 40 [[diesel generator]] sets driving four propellers through geared [[electric motors]]. Harland & Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted [[steam turbine]] propulsion. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|'cathedral' diesel engines]], each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made ''Oceanic'' the first quadruple-screw [[Motor ship]]. But by the time all parties had settled on the use of diesel, the [[Great Depression]] was hitting the shipping business.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nFurther work on ''Oceanic'' was postponed, and later cancelled due to the collapse of the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]], owners of the White Star Line, as a result of the financial problems of [[Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant|Sir Owen Philips, Lord Kylsant]]. The [[Royal Mail Case]], as it was known, led to the imprisonment and loss of title of Owen Philips, also due to substantial changes in accounting and auditing practice. Loans backed by the governments of England and Northern Ireland intended for the construction of ''Oceanic'' were diverted to the construction of the last two ships built for White Star, [[MV Britannic (1929)|''Britannic'']] and her near twin sister, [[MV Georgic (1931)|''Georgic'']]. These two liners may have been built with steel plate ordered for ''Oceanic'', whose partially built hull was subsequently dismantled and recycled after the aforementioned diversion of funds.\n\nBased on the third set design drawn by Harland and Wolff, the ship would have measured at least 1000 feet long with a tonnage of 80,000 tons and have three squat funnels, making her appear like a larger version of ''Georgic'' and roughly the same size as her rivals {{SS|Normandie}} and {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, along with powerful engines which would potentially have enabled the ship to gain the [[Blue Riband]] record for speed. Her extensive interiors were to have been, to a large degree, based on the popular [[Art Deco]] fashions of the day pioneered on ocean liners by the [[French Line]]'s {{SS|Ile de France}} just a few years earlier in 1927.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180210041047/http://www.titanic-whitestarships.com/Oceanic%20III.htm Proposed RMS Oceanic III]\n* [http://www.whitestarmoments.wixsite.com/whitestarmoments/mv-oceanic-iii M.V.

I-291 is roughly a northeast/southwest highway. It merges with I-91 at its southwestern terminus, via a flyover. The road meets the Mass Pike at its northeastern terminus. Getting onto the Pike from I-291 is straightforward, but getting from the Pike to I-291 requires a left turn at an at-grade traffic signal. I-291 travels directly through highly populated areas of Springfield, and passes under several overpasses. From its southwestern terminus to exit 5A, Interstate 291 is [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 20]].\n\nI-291 is only {{convert|22.4|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate 291]] in [[Connecticut]], and there are no intervening Interstate Highway interchanges between them. It can be easy for travelers to become confused between the two highways.{{fact|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Route description==\nInterstate 291 begins as a spur of Interstate 91 at Exit 8 in Springfield, concurrent with U.S. 20, which merges from the north. The two entry ramps from I-91 merge with each other after Exits 2A and 2B, where a sign for the beginning of I-291 east is posted. I-291 and U.S. 20 run eastbound concurrently until Exit 5A (U.S. 20 joins westbound at Exit 5), where U.S. 20 east leaves the highway for a junction with [[Massachusetts Route 20A|Route 20A]]. I-291 continues east into Chicopee, where it intersects the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 90]]).  I-291 ends at an odd intersection at a stoplight on Burnett Road, but I-291 east traffic can exit uninterrupted by way of a ramp to the Mass Pike. However, drivers coming from the Mass Pike must deal with this traffic light, as a left turn across the intersection is required to get on I-291 west.\n\nThe westbound interchange with I-91 is unusual in that the ramps for Exit 1A-B split before the ramps for Exits 2A-B do.  Traffic bound for Exit 2A (Chestnut Street) must first take the ramp for Exit 1A (I-91 South), and traffic bound for Exit 2B (Dwight St.) must first take the ramp for Exit 1B (I-91 North).\n\nTraffic bound for U.S. 20 West from I-291 takes Exit 1B. U.S. 20 does not actually join with I-91, but rather this exit splits, left for the on-ramp to I-91 North, the right to continue on the U.S. 20 access ramp.\n\n==History==\nI-291 was originally conceived in 1953, prior to the creation of the Interstate Highway System, as the Springfield Expressway, which would bypass [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] and connect to the [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|US 5 expressway]] (now I-91) and the proposed [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. I-291 follows the original planned alignment of the expressway, except for the stretch between exit 4 (St. James Avenue) and exit 5 (US 20/MA 20A/Page Boulevard). The original planned alignment had the route turn in almost a perfect 90 degree angle onto Roosevelt Avenue, but industrial development (including the relocation of [[Smith & Wesson]]'s corporate headquarters) had the highway turn more gently.

{"title_page": "Peeping Tom (theatre company)", "text_new": "{{peacock|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''Peeping Tom''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[theatre]] company founded by Argentinian choreographer Gabriela Carrizo (I/AR) and French choreographer Franck Chartier (F) in 2000. The pair met while working at several other Belgian companies, including Les Ballets C de la B. In 1999, they created a first location project that was set in a trailer home, Caravana, with would-be long-time collaborator Eurudike De Beul. This location project was followed by the film Une Vie Inutile (2000).\n\nPeeping Tom's style finds itself between dance, theatre, opera and performance. Their works start out from a hyperrealist aesthetic in a concrete set, like a garden (Le Jardin, 2002), a living room (Le Salon, 2004), two trailer homes in a snow-covered landscape (32 Rue Vandenbranden, 2009), a retirement home (Vader, 2014) or a forest (Kind, 2019). Then, the directors break open this realism and create an unstable universe that defies the logic of time and space. Isolation lead to an unconscious world of nightmares, fears and desires, which the creators deftly use to shed light on the dark side of a character or a community. The huis clos of family situations remains for Peeping Tom a major source of creativity. \n\nSince their foundation, the company has created 8 shows: Le Jardin (2002), Le Salon (2004), Le Sous Sol (2007), 32 Rue Vandenbranden (2009), A Louer (2011), Vader (2014), Moeder (2016) and Kind (2019). In addition, the choreographers have collaborated extensively with other companies across Europe as well. In 2013, Gabriela Carrizo created The Missing Door for [[Nederlands Dans Theater]] (NDT I), and in 2015 she directed ''The Land'' for the [[Residenz Theatre|Residenztheater]] in [[Munich]]. Franck Chartier directed 33 Rue Vandenbranden in 2013 for the [[Gothenburg opera house|G\u00f6teborg Opera]] in Sweden. It was an adaptation of the original piece by Peeping Tom, 32 Rue Vandenbranden. In 2015, he directed The Lost Room for [[Nederlands Dans Theater]], followed by The Hidden Floor in 2017. In 2018, Carrizo and Chartier co-directed 31 Rue Vandenbranden, an adaptation they made for the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon|Op\u00e9ra de Lyon]] which opened the 2018 Biennale de la Danse in Lyon. \n\n== Name and style ==\n\n=== Name ===\nAccording to one of Peeping Tom's co-founders, Gabriela Carrizo, they chose the name 'Peeping Tom' as a reference to voyeurism. It came from their first performance, ''Caravana'', during which the audience would look through the windows of the camping car. It was a way for them to plunge into the heart of the characters' intimacy.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://bachtrack.com/fr_FR/interview-gabriela-carizo-compagnie-peeping-tom-janvier-2017|title=Gabriela Carrizo-Peeping Tom|website=bachtrack.com|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe company has a distinct style. In a portrait for Contemporary Arts from Flanders, theatre scientist Lieve Dierckx describes it as:  \"[...]the organic interweaving between the daily life of the performers and their artistic work, a zoom in on fears and fantasies in relational constellations that are as familiar as they are intimate in hyper-realistic stage sets.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://dossiers.kunsten.be/dance/portrait/peeping-tom|title=Peeping Tom {{!}} Dans & Publiek|website=dossiers.kunsten.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In addition, \"Peeping Tom does not narrate specific stories that have a clear beginning, development and end, in their works; they create fragmentary and irrational worlds like one can experience in dreams.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Kerem \u00d6zel|first=Mehmet|url=https://www.unlimitedrag.com/art-unlimited|title=Memories about mother, drifting in time and space|date=November-December 2017|work=Art Unlimited|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nTo create their work, Peeping Tom also use cinematographic techniques, including sound, lights and the zoom from the camera.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jays|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/peeping-tom-moeder-london-mime-festival-barbican-d69hktldt|title=Peeping Tom bring Moeder to London International Mime Festival|access-date=2020-04-17|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Moreover, according to Carrizo and Chartier, a big inspiration in their work comes from the work of the photographer [[Gregory Crewdson]].<ref name=\":1\" /> And for their show ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'', they worked with Belgian cinematographer Nico Leunen, who worked as a dramaturge on the piece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/2|title=32 rue Vandenbranden / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n== Performances ==\n\n=== The first trilogy ===\nFrom 2002 till 2007, Peeping Tom created three shows that formed their first trilogy: ''Le Jardin, Le Salon'' (their international break-through) and ''Le Sous Sol''. According to Lieve Dierckx, \"In thematic terms this trilogy forms a house in which the performers take on the battle with the baggage they bring with them.\"<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==== ''Le Jardin'' (2002) ====\n''Le Jardin'' was Peeping Tom's first show for the theatre. It was created in 2002 by Gabriela Carrizo, Franck Chartier and Dutch actor Simon Versnel.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/1|title=Le Jardin / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The performance was divided into two parts. The first part was a film that showed a group of diverse and unusual characters who immerse themselves in the nightlife. It symbolises a dream or a nightmare.<ref name=\":2\" /> The second part was the live performance, with the three characters - Carrizo, Chartier and Versnel - in a beautifully tended garden. The show premiered on 13 June 2002 in Ghent (Belgium). \n\n==== ''Le Salon'' (2004) ====\n''Le Salon'' was created in 2004 by Carrizo, Chartier and Versnel, with Mezzo-Soprano Eurudike De Beul and dancer Samuel Lefeuvre joining the cast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/3|title=Le Salon / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The show meant the international break for the Belgian company. ''Le Salon'' has been described as showing the mental, physical and financial decay of what was once a wealthy family. A unique part of the show was Carrizo and Chartier's young child, Uma Chartier. The three developed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1SIUcfS1Zw a kissing dance], which since has becoming internationally famous. ''Le Salon'' premiered on 4 November 2004 at La Rose des Vents in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq|Villeneuve d'Ascq]] (France). \n\n==== ''Le Sous Sol (2007)'' ====\nThe first trilogy was closed by ''Le Sous Sol'', which included Carrizo, Chartier, Lefeuvre, De Beul and Spanish Butoh-dancer Maria Otal.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-low-countries.com/article/the-voyeuristic-universe-of-peeping-tom|title=The Voyeuristic Universe of Peeping Tom|website=the low countries|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In this piece, the members of the family are now dead and buried.

It was selected for the Belgian-Dutch Theaterfestival and was performed at the Kaaitheater in Brussels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kaaitheater.be/en/agenda/le-sous-sol|title=Le sous sol|website=Kaaitheater|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The final show took place on 24 July 2009 in [[Kalamata]] (Greece). \n\n=== ''32 Rue Vandenbranden and A Louer'' ===\nIn 2009, Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier left the stage and focused on the artistic direction of Peeping Tom and on co-directing their new pieces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For the first time, the company held wide-scale auditions, resulting in a few dancers joining the company who would stay with them for several years: Belgian dancer Marie Gyselbrecht, British dancer Jos Baker, Korean dancers Hun-mok Jung and Seoljin Kim, and later Brazilian dancer Maria Carolina Vieira.  \n\n==== ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' (2009) ====\n''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' was the first show that Carrizo and Chartier co-directed after leaving the stage. It premiered on 28 November 2009 at the Koninklijke Vlaamse Schouwburg in Brussels. The show puts two mobile homes in an inhospitable winter landscape, and exposes the unrest in (love) relationships. Isolation and loneliness are the dark side of the desire to be loved.<ref name=\":3\" /> In an interview with Luxemburg newspaper Le Quotidien, Chartier describes it as putting an address to the house of the previous trilogy, and the show is about how we act outside, how people live in a closed community and what happens when two strangers arrive to this village.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chimienti|first=Pablo|url=https://lequotidien.lu/|title=\u00abPour nous, la danse est essentielle\u00bb|date=31 May 2018|work=Le Quotidien|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=Dead}}</ref> ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' has opened up new countries and cities to Peeping Tom. They performed in London for the first time in 2015, during the International London Mime Festival, and went to the United States in 2019, performing at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] [[Next Wave Festival]]. \n\n==== ''A Louer'' (2011) ====\n''A Louer'' was created in 2011, with the premiere taking place on 15 October 2011 at KVS in Brussels. The piece addresses the theme of transience: a fading but talented opera diva wanders around in an overwhelming interior and struggles with the expectations of a bourgeois environment. Nothing is certain or permanent (including the decor), except for her own recurring fears. Fearsome sounds highlight the insignificance of the characters.<ref name=\":3\" /> For this creation, Carrizo and Chartier worked again with Simon Versnel (with whom they hadn't worked on a new creation since ''Le Salon'' in 2004), and invited Leo De Beul - the father of mezzo-soprano Eurudike De Beul - to join them on stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/8#introduction|title=A Louer / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n=== The second trilogy ===\n\nAfter the creation of ''A Louer'', Carrizo and Chartier took on offers outside of the company: Carrizo went to work on ''The missing door'' with Nederlands Dans Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndt.nl/en/team/gabriela-carizzo-2/|title=Gabriela Carizzo|website=Nederlands Dans Theater|language=en-EN|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, while Chartier recreated Peeping Tom's ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' for the G\u00f6teborg Opera, titled ''33 Rue Vandenbranden.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.opera.se/forestallningar/33-rue-vandenbranden-2012-2013/|title=33, rue Vandenbranden {{!}} The G\u00f6teborg Opera|website=en.opera.se|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Within the company, they started to work differently again, focusing each on another show to direct. According to Gabriela Carrizo, they wanted to change the dynamics and see how each could operate on their own.<ref name=\":4\" /> This would become the starting point for their second trilogy: ''Vader'' (2014), ''Moeder'' (2016) and ''Kind'' (2019). Moreover, the company added two new dancers to their ensemble: the Taiwanese dancer Yi-chun Liu and the Belgian dancer Brandon Lagaert. \n\n==== ''Vader'' (2014) ====\nFranck Chartier directed ''Vader'', with Gabriela Carrizo working alongside him as directorial assistant and dramaturge.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/9#introduction|title=Vader / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The piece is set in the visiting area of a retirement home, whose towering walls accentuate the fact that the action takes place deep underground. At the centre of this netherworld, somewhere between the world of the living and the dead, stands the figure of the father, who seems to be distancing himself gradually from the human community. His fading is drawn, not from the story of one individual, but from the mythology of the father, and in scenes that explode into action, and just as suddenly stop, this figure appears at once as God-like and ridiculous, as possessed of a rich mental life, and as disconnected, decaying, empty. His past may harbour a deep secret, or maybe he is simply mad or delusional. The other residents and the staff wonder at him, regarding him with amusement and hatred, affection and indifference.<ref name=\":5\" /> ''Vader'' premiered on 10 May 2014 in Ludwigshafen, Germany. \n\n==== ''Moeder'' (2016) ====\nFor the second part of their family trilogy, Carrizo and Chartier reversed their roles. Now Gabriela Carrizo was directing, with Franck Chartier acting as directorial assistant and dramaturge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/13|title=Moeder / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In an interview with Bachtrack, Gabriela Carrizo explained the idea behind ''Moeder'': \"''Moeder'' is not about one mother, but about several mothers. We talk about motherhood, the absence and the lack of it. The play searches the memory and the subconscious to reveal what the mother carries as desires, fears, sufferings or violence. [...] Moeder opens on a funeral and then winds up the thread of memories. Due to the aseptic and museum-like handling of the staging, and the distance between the characters, we also evoke the process of distancing in the memory, especially in intense moments of life. Moeder is not a catharsis, but it is certain that I have projected much of myself, also unconsciously. The idea of a museum is in particular a reference to my mother's funeral, where we had exhibited paintings..\"<ref name=\":4\" /> ''Moeder had its world premiere on 29 September 2016 in Ludwigshafen, Germany.'' \n\n==== ''Kind'' (2019) ====\nFor the final part of their family trilogy, Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier decided to co-direct again. ''KInd'' premiered on 23 April 2019 at Les Th\u00e9\u00e2tres de la Ville du Luxembourg, in [[Luxembourg|Luxemburg]]. The basis for ''Kind'' is the perspective of the child and children\u2019s internal and external world. Every action is driven by how children see the world, by their fears and desires. The choreographers investigate how a child\u2019s perspective changes as it grows and develops itself on its way to adolescence and adulthood, with all the associated choices, pressures, fears, doubts and physical changes, and how this translates into gestures and body language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/18#introduction|title=Kind / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n=== '''New creations''' ===\nIn 2019, the company announced a new round of international auditions, the first time since 2013. They stated that they were looking for an entirely new cast for a new creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://au-di-tions.com/peeping-tom-is-looking-for-dancers-f-m-for-an-adaptation-of-adrift-possible-future-projects/|title=Peeping Tom is Looking for Dancers (f/m), for an Adaptation of Adrift & Possible Future Projects|last=HGauditions|website=au-di-tions.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> This creation would start in the course of 2020. In the end, the company chose eight new performers: French dancers Konan Dayot and Fanny Sage, Spanish dancer Alejandro Moya, Australian dancer Lauren Langlois, Taiwanese dancer Wan-Lun Yu, Italian dancer Eliana Stragapede, Belgian dancer Fons Dhossche and Cypriot dancer Panos Malactos. \n\n==== ''Triptych: The missing door, The lost room and The hidden floor'' (2020) ====\nThe company announced the title for their new creation in 2019: ''Triptych: The missing door, The lost room and The hidden floor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fransbrood.com/en/productions/triptych-the-missing-door-the-lost-room-the-hidden-floor/|title=DIPTYCH / TRIPTYCH|website=Frans Brood Productions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> It is an adaptation of the three pieces that Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier created between 2013 and 2017 with Nederlands Dans Theater. Peeping Tom produces the show themselves and will tour it with the eight new castmembers. The show is scheduled to premiere in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fransbrood.com/en/productions/triptych-the-missing-door-the-lost-room-the-hidden-floor/|title=DIPTYCH / TRIPTYCH|website=Frans Brood Productions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> It is also available in a smaller format, called ''Diptych: The missing door and The lost room''. \n\n== Collaborations ==\nSince 2013, choreographers Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier have opened up to collaborations with other companies, aside from their work with Peeping Tom. \n\n=== Work with Nederlands Dans Theater ===\nIn 2013, Gabriela Carrizo was invited to make a first short piece with the dancers of NDT I at [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. This would become ''The missing door''. In the piece, Gabriela Carrizo shows two parallel dimensions in this creation. We are witnessing the last minutes of life, which take place in the twilight zone between life and death. The dying man anxiously tries to find a way through the intricate maze of his thoughts. While soundscapes of everyday sounds turn into lost rhythms, the man performs a lonely battle with time, space and those who are absent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/11|title=The missing door / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nIn 2015, it was Chartier's turn to create a piece with NDT I. He made a sequel to ''The missing door'', called ''The lost room''. It is set on a ship at sea, where freedom and entrapment go hand in hand. In a labyrinth of rooms and corridors, several stories are told simultaneously. Characters seemingly exist in every time and every place. ''The lost room'' could be seen as a melancholic nostalgia for the future. In addition, memories are often not a literal reproduction of the past, but instead rely on constructive processes that are sometimes prone to error and distortion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/16|title=The lost room / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nFranck Chartier returned to Nederlands Dans Theater in 2017, to create the short piece ''The hidden floor''.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/17|title=The hidden floor / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The piece addresses some of the themes that were already present in the previous two productions: the memory, the disruption of time. The characters find themselves in a public space, maybe a restaurant, taken over by nature. They are experiencing their final moments as the water slowly starts to rise.

With the ballet company of the opera, he created ''33 Rue Vandenbranden.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/19|title=33 rue Vandenbranden / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In 2018, Carrizo and Chartier joined forces to create another adaptation of the piece.

''The Land'' plunges its audience into a world in which the loss of the self stands central. The \"game\" commences with a village community finding itself in the midst of a miniature landscape. A story rich in paradoxes unravels, revolving around the notions of inconsistency and alienation, proximity and distance whilst toying with the way we perceive the world around us.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/10#introduction|title=The Land / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Other projects ==\n\n=== Documentary about Peeping Tom ===\nBelgian documentary filmmakers Mieke Struyve and Lotte Stoops approached Peeping Tom to make a documentary about life behind the scenes. ''Third Act'' follows the company on tour around the world with the trilogy ''Vader'', ''Moeder'' and ''Kind''. The theme of this trilogy, ageing and family, touches everybody's lives, including those of the actors themselves. In the film sublimated theatrical stories are woven together with sensitive personal contributions. At each stop on the international tour, Peeping Tom works with local senior citizens as extras. These extras have been sought out beforehand and receive a crash-course in acting before they step onto the stage, often for the first time in their lives. Their personal lives provide an insight into ageing in their countries and create a dialogue with what Peeping Tom presents on stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.savagefilm.be/documentary/THIRD-ACT|title=Documentary {{!}} Savage Film|website=www.savagefilm.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Artist-in-Residence at the KMSKA in Antwerp ===\nPeeping Tom was invited to develop a project as Artist in Residence for the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp (KMSKA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kmska.be/en/artists-in-residence?gclid=CjwKCAjwp-X0BRAFEiwAheRuiy-lDXAD0Z6AjNjKB4331VadMrH1jMpaUrnM7qgG2JdXs-X-9ystcxoCG1EQAvD_BwE|title=Artists in Residence {{!}} KMSKA|website=www.kmska.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>.

In 2007, the company received the Mont Blanc Young Directors Award during the [[Salzburg Festival]] and the Patrons Circle Award at the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]]. The pieces Le Sous Sol and A Louer were both selected for the Theaterfestival, which gathers the best shows of the season in Belgium and The Netherlands. In 2013, A Louer was nominated for the prestigious Ubu Awards in Italy, in the category Best Performance in Foreign Language, during the theatrical season 2012-2013. 32 rue Vandenbranden was elected Best Dance Show of the Year 2013 in S\u00e3o Paulo (BR) by magazine Guia Folha and won in 2015 a prestigious Olivier Award, in the category 'Best New Dance Production'.\n\nPeeping Tom's latest production, Vader (Father), is the first part of the trilogy Father-Mother-Children. It premiered on 10 May 2014 in Theater im Pfalzbau (Ludwigshafen, DE) and was elected Best Dance Performance of 2014 by Dutch newspaper [[NRC Handelsblad]]. The jury of the 'Premios de la Cr\u00edtica Barcelona' awarded Vader in its turn with a first prize in the category 'Best International Dance Production of 2014'.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n* [http://www.peepingtom.be Official website]\n*[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/andalucia/danza/vital/Peeping/Tom/elpepiespand/20091211elpand_15/Tes Review in ''El Pa\u00eds''] {{in lang|es}}\n\n[[Category:Musical theatre companies]]\n\n\n{{Europe-theat-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{peacock|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''Peeping Tom''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[theatre]] company founded by Argentinian choreographer Gabriela Carrizo (I/AR) and French choreographer Franck Chartier (F) in 2000. The pair met while working at several other Belgian companies, including Les Ballets C de la B. In 1999, they created a first location project that was set in a trailer home, Caravana, with would-be long-time collaborator Eurudike De Beul. This location project was followed by the film Une Vie Inutile (2000).\n\nPeeping Tom's style finds itself between dance, theatre, opera and performance. Their works start out from a hyperrealist aesthetic in a concrete set, like a garden (Le Jardin, 2002), a living room (Le Salon, 2004), two trailer homes in a snow-covered landscape (32 Rue Vandenbranden, 2009), a retirement home (Vader, 2014) or a forest (Kind, 2019). Then, the directors break open this realism and create an unstable universe that defies the logic of time and space. Isolation lead to an unconscious world of nightmares, fears and desires, which the creators deftly use to shed light on the dark side of a character or a community. The huis clos of family situations remains for Peeping Tom a major source of creativity. \n\nSince their foundation, the company has created 8 shows: Le Jardin (2002), Le Salon (2004), Le Sous Sol (2007), 32 Rue Vandenbranden (2009), A Louer (2011), Vader (2014), Moeder (2016) and Kind (2019). In addition, the choreographers have collaborated extensively with other companies across Europe as well. In 2013, Gabriela Carrizo created The Missing Door for [[Nederlands Dans Theater]] (NDT I), and in 2015 she directed ''The Land'' for the [[Residenz Theatre|Residenztheater]] in [[Munich]]. Franck Chartier directed 33 Rue Vandenbranden in 2013 for the [[Gothenburg opera house|G\u00f6teborg Opera]] in Sweden. It was an adaptation of the original piece by Peeping Tom, 32 Rue Vandenbranden. In 2015, he directed The Lost Room for [[Nederlands Dans Theater]], followed by The Hidden Floor in 2017. In 2018, Carrizo and Chartier co-directed 31 Rue Vandenbranden, an adaptation they made for the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon|Op\u00e9ra de Lyon]] which opened the 2018 Biennale de la Danse in Lyon. \n\n== Name and style ==\n\n=== Name ===\nAccording to one of Peeping Tom's co-founders, Gabriela Carrizo, they chose the name 'Peeping Tom' as a reference to voyeurism. It came from their first performance, ''Caravana'', during which the audience would look through the windows of the camping car. It was a way for them to plunge into the heart of the characters' intimacy.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://bachtrack.com/fr_FR/interview-gabriela-carizo-compagnie-peeping-tom-janvier-2017|title=Gabriela Carrizo-Peeping Tom|website=bachtrack.com|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe company has a distinct style. In a portrait for Contemporary Arts from Flanders, theatre scientist Lieve Dierckx describes it as:  \"[...]the organic interweaving between the daily life of the performers and their artistic work, a zoom in on fears and fantasies in relational constellations that are as familiar as they are intimate in hyper-realistic stage sets.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://dossiers.kunsten.be/dance/portrait/peeping-tom|title=Peeping Tom {{!}} Dans & Publiek|website=dossiers.kunsten.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In addition, \"Peeping Tom does not narrate specific stories that have a clear beginning, development and end, in their works; they create fragmentary and irrational worlds like one can experience in dreams.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Kerem \u00d6zel|first=Mehmet|url=https://www.unlimitedrag.com/art-unlimited|title=Memories about mother, drifting in time and space|date=November-December 2017|work=Art Unlimited|access-date=17 april 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nTo create their work, Peeping Tom also use cinematographic techniques, including sound, lights and the zoom from the camera.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jays|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/peeping-tom-moeder-london-mime-festival-barbican-d69hktldt|title=Peeping Tom bring Moeder to London International Mime Festival|access-date=2020-04-17|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Moreover, according to Carrizo and Chartier, a big inspiration in their work comes from the work of the photographer [[Gregory Crewdson]].<ref name=\":1\" /> And for their show ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'', they worked with Belgian cinematographer Nico Leunen, who worked as a dramaturge on the piece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/2|title=32 rue Vandenbranden / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n== Performances ==\n\n=== The first trilogy ===\nFrom 2002 till 2007, Peeping Tom created three shows that formed their first trilogy: ''Le Jardin, Le Salon'' (their international break-through) and ''Le Sous Sol''. According to Lieve Dierckx, \"In thematic terms this trilogy forms a house in which the performers take on the battle with the baggage they bring with them.\"<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==== ''Le Jardin'' (2002) ====\n''Le Jardin'' was Peeping Tom's first show for the theatre. It was created in 2002 by Gabriela Carrizo, Franck Chartier and Dutch actor Simon Versnel.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/1|title=Le Jardin / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The performance was divided into two parts. The first part was a film that showed a group of diverse and unusual characters who immerse themselves in the nightlife. It symbolises a dream or a nightmare.<ref name=\":2\" /> The second part was the live performance, with the three characters - Carrizo, Chartier and Versnel - in a beautifully tended garden. The show premiered on 13 June 2002 in Ghent (Belgium). \n\n==== ''Le Salon'' (2004) ====\n''Le Salon'' was created in 2004 by Carrizo, Chartier and Versnel, with Mezzo-Soprano Eurudike De Beul and dancer Samuel Lefeuvre joining the cast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/3|title=Le Salon / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The show meant the international break for the Belgian company. ''Le Salon'' has been described as showing the mental, physical and financial decay of what was once a wealthy family. A unique part of the show was Carrizo and Chartier's young child, Uma Chartier. The three developed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1SIUcfS1Zw a kissing dance], which since has becoming internationally famous. ''Le Salon'' premiered on 4 November 2004 at La Rose des Vents in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq|Villeneuve d'Ascq]] (France). \n\n==== ''Le Sous Sol (2007)'' ====\nThe first trilogy was closed by ''Le Sous Sol'', which included Carrizo, Chartier, Lefeuvre, De Beul and Spanish Butoh-dancer Maria Otal.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-low-countries.com/article/the-voyeuristic-universe-of-peeping-tom|title=The Voyeuristic Universe of Peeping Tom|website=the low countries|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In this piece, the members of the family are now dead and buried.

It premiered on 28 November 2009 at the Koninklijke Vlaamse Schouwburg in Brussels. The show puts two mobile homes in an inhospitable winter landscape, and exposes the unrest in (love) relationships. Isolation and loneliness are the dark side of the desire to be loved.<ref name=\":3\" /> In an interview with Luxemburg newspaper Le Quotidien, Chartier describes it as putting an address to the house of the previous trilogy, and the show is about how we act outside, how people live in a closed community and what happens when two strangers arrive to this village.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chimienti|first=Pablo|url=https://lequotidien.lu/|title=\u00abPour nous, la danse est essentielle\u00bb|date=31 May 2018|work=Le Quotidien|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=Dead}}</ref> ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' has opened up new countries and cities to Peeping Tom. They performed in London for the first time in 2015, during the International London Mime Festival, and went to the United States in 2019, performing at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] [[Next Wave Festival]]. \n\n==== ''A Louer'' (2011) ====\n''A Louer'' was created in 2011, with the premiere taking place on 15 October 2011 at KVS in Brussels. The piece addresses the theme of transience: a fading but talented opera diva wanders around in an overwhelming interior and struggles with the expectations of a bourgeois environment. Nothing is certain or permanent (including the decor), except for her own recurring fears. Fearsome sounds highlight the insignificance of the characters.<ref name=\":3\" /> For this creation, Carrizo and Chartier worked again with Simon Versnel (with whom they hadn't worked on a new creation since ''Le Salon'' in 2004), and invited Leo De Beul - the father of mezzo-soprano Eurudike De Beul - to join them on stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peepingtom.be/en/productions/8#introduction|title=A Louer / Peeping Tom - productions|website=www.peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n=== The second trilogy ===\n\nAfter the creation of ''A Louer'', Carrizo and Chartier took on offers outside of the company: Carrizo went to work on ''The missing door'' with Nederlands Dans Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndt.nl/en/team/gabriela-carizzo-2/|title=Gabriela Carizzo|website=Nederlands Dans Theater|language=en-EN|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, while Chartier recreated Peeping Tom's ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' for the G\u00f6teborg Opera, titled ''33 Rue Vandenbranden.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.opera.se/forestallningar/33-rue-vandenbranden-2012-2013/|title=33, rue Vandenbranden {{!}} The G\u00f6teborg Opera|website=en.opera.se|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Within the company, they started to work differently again, focusing each on another show to direct. According to Gabriela Carrizo, they wanted to change the dynamics and see how each could operate on their own.<ref name=\":4\" /> This would become the starting point for their second trilogy: ''Vader'' (2014), ''Moeder'' (2016) and ''Kind'' (2019). Moreover, the company added two new dancers to their ensemble: the Taiwanese dancer Yi-chun Liu and the Belgian dancer Brandon Lagaert. \n\n==== ''Vader'' (2014) ====\nFranck Chartier directed ''Vader'', with Gabriela Carrizo working alongside him as directorial assistant and dramaturge.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/9#introduction|title=Vader / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The piece is set in the visiting area of a retirement home, whose towering walls accentuate the fact that the action takes place deep underground. At the centre of this netherworld, somewhere between the world of the living and the dead, stands the figure of the father, who seems to be distancing himself gradually from the human community. His fading is drawn, not from the story of one individual, but from the mythology of the father, and in scenes that explode into action, and just as suddenly stop, this figure appears at once as God-like and ridiculous, as possessed of a rich mental life, and as disconnected, decaying, empty. His past may harbour a deep secret, or maybe he is simply mad or delusional. The other residents and the staff wonder at him, regarding him with amusement and hatred, affection and indifference.<ref name=\":5\" /> ''Vader'' premiered on 10 May 2014 in Ludwigshafen, Germany. \n\n==== ''Moeder'' (2016) ====\nFor the second part of their family trilogy, Carrizo and Chartier reversed their roles. Now Gabriela Carrizo was directing, with Franck Chartier acting as directorial assistant and dramaturge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/13|title=Moeder / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In an interview with Bachtrack, Gabriela Carrizo explained the idea behind ''Moeder'': \"''Moeder'' is not about one mother, but about several mothers. We talk about motherhood, the absence and the lack of it. The play searches the memory and the subconscious to reveal what the mother carries as desires, fears, sufferings or violence. [...] Moeder opens on a funeral and then winds up the thread of memories. Due to the aseptic and museum-like handling of the staging, and the distance between the characters, we also evoke the process of distancing in the memory, especially in intense moments of life. Moeder is not a catharsis, but it is certain that I have projected much of myself, also unconsciously. The idea of a museum is in particular a reference to my mother's funeral, where we had exhibited paintings..\"<ref name=\":4\" /> ''Moeder had its world premiere on 29 September 2016 in Ludwigshafen, Germany.'' \n\n==== ''Kind'' (2019) ====\nFor the final part of their family trilogy, Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier decided to co-direct again. ''KInd'' premiered on 23 April 2019 at Les Th\u00e9\u00e2tres de la Ville du Luxembourg, in [[Luxembourg|Luxemburg]]. The basis for ''Kind'' is the perspective of the child and children\u2019s internal and external world. Every action is driven by how children see the world, by their fears and desires. The choreographers investigate how a child\u2019s perspective changes as it grows and develops itself on its way to adolescence and adulthood, with all the associated choices, pressures, fears, doubts and physical changes, and how this translates into gestures and body language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/18#introduction|title=Kind / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\n=== '''New creations''' ===\nIn 2019, the company announced a new round of international auditions, the first time since 2013. They stated that they were looking for an entirely new cast for a new creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://au-di-tions.com/peeping-tom-is-looking-for-dancers-f-m-for-an-adaptation-of-adrift-possible-future-projects/|title=Peeping Tom is Looking for Dancers (f/m), for an Adaptation of Adrift & Possible Future Projects|last=HGauditions|website=au-di-tions.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> This creation would start in the course of 2020. In the end, the company chose eight new performers: French dancers Konan Dayot and Fanny Sage, Spanish dancer Alejandro Moya, Australian dancer Lauren Langlois, Taiwanese dancer Wan-Lun Yu, Italian dancer Eliana Stragapede, Belgian dancer Fons Dhossche and Cypriot dancer Panos Malactos. \n\n==== ''Triptych: The missing door, The lost room and The hidden floor'' (2020) ====\nThe company announced the title for their new creation in 2019: ''Triptych: The missing door, The lost room and The hidden floor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fransbrood.com/en/productions/triptych-the-missing-door-the-lost-room-the-hidden-floor/|title=DIPTYCH / TRIPTYCH|website=Frans Brood Productions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> It is an adaptation of the three pieces that Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier created between 2013 and 2017 with Nederlands Dans Theater. Peeping Tom produces the show themselves and will tour it with the eight new castmembers. The show is scheduled to premiere in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fransbrood.com/en/productions/triptych-the-missing-door-the-lost-room-the-hidden-floor/|title=DIPTYCH / TRIPTYCH|website=Frans Brood Productions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> It is also available in a smaller format, called ''Diptych: The missing door and The lost room''. \n\n== Collaborations ==\nSince 2013, choreographers Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier have opened up to collaborations with other companies, aside from their work with Peeping Tom. \n\n=== Work with Nederlands Dans Theater ===\nIn 2013, Gabriela Carrizo was invited to make a first short piece with the dancers of NDT I at [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. This would become ''The missing door''. In the piece, Gabriela Carrizo shows two parallel dimensions in this creation. We are witnessing the last minutes of life, which take place in the twilight zone between life and death. The dying man anxiously tries to find a way through the intricate maze of his thoughts. While soundscapes of everyday sounds turn into lost rhythms, the man performs a lonely battle with time, space and those who are absent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/11|title=The missing door / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nIn 2015, it was Chartier's turn to create a piece with NDT I. He made a sequel to ''The missing door'', called ''The lost room''. It is set on a ship at sea, where freedom and entrapment go hand in hand. In a labyrinth of rooms and corridors, several stories are told simultaneously. Characters seemingly exist in every time and every place. ''The lost room'' could be seen as a melancholic nostalgia for the future. In addition, memories are often not a literal reproduction of the past, but instead rely on constructive processes that are sometimes prone to error and distortion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/16|title=The lost room / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nFranck Chartier returned to Nederlands Dans Theater in 2017, to create the short piece ''The hidden floor''.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/17|title=The hidden floor / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The piece addresses some of the themes that were already present in the previous two productions: the memory, the disruption of time. The characters find themselves in a public space, maybe a restaurant, taken over by nature. They are experiencing their final moments as the water slowly starts to rise. Holding on to their last hope, they try to survive and find a way out, not only physically but also mentally.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Adaptations of ''32 Rue Vandenbranden'' ===\nIn 2013, Franck Chartier went to the [[Gothenburg opera house|G\u00f6teborg Opera]] in Sweden to work on an adaptation of Peeping Tom's original piece, ''32 Rue Vandenbranden''. With the ballet company of the opera, he created ''33 Rue Vandenbranden.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/19|title=33 rue Vandenbranden / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In 2018, Carrizo and Chartier joined forces to create another adaptation of the piece. This time, they created ''31 Rue Vandenbranden'' for the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon|Op\u00e9ra de Lyon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peepingtom.be/en/productions/20#introduction|title=31 rue Vandenbranden / Peeping Tom - productions|website=peepingtom.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> For this piece, they doubled the parts, going from six dancers in the original piece to about fifteen in the adaptation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://next.liberation.fr/theatre/2018/09/06/l-opera-de-lyon-met-la-rue-vandenbranden-sur-son-31_1677000|title=L\u2019op\u00e9ra de Lyon met la rue Vandenbranden sur son 31|date=2018-09-06|website=Lib\u00e9ration.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Land'' ===\nIn 2015, Peeping Tom collaborated with [[Residenz Theatre|Residenz Theater]] in Germany and made ''The Land,'' directed by Gabriela Carrizo.

''Third Act'' follows the company on tour around the world with the trilogy ''Vader'', ''Moeder'' and ''Kind''. The theme of this trilogy, ageing and family, touches everybody's lives, including those of the actors themselves. In the film sublimated theatrical stories are woven together with sensitive personal contributions. At each stop on the international tour, Peeping Tom works with local senior citizens as extras. These extras have been sought out beforehand and receive a crash-course in acting before they step onto the stage, often for the first time in their lives. Their personal lives provide an insight into ageing in their countries and create a dialogue with what Peeping Tom presents on stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.savagefilm.be/documentary/THIRD-ACT|title=Documentary {{!}} Savage Film|website=www.savagefilm.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Artist-in-Residence at the KMSKA in Antwerp ===\nPeeping Tom was invited to develop a project as Artist in Residence for the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp (KMSKA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kmska.be/en/artists-in-residence?gclid=CjwKCAjwp-X0BRAFEiwAheRuiy-lDXAD0Z6AjNjKB4331VadMrH1jMpaUrnM7qgG2JdXs-X-9ystcxoCG1EQAvD_BwE|title=Artists in Residence {{!}} KMSKA|website=www.kmska.be|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>.

Grasso Boulevard in the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. It proceeds northward, crossing [[US Route 1|US 1]] and has a brief concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]].  It then turns northwest onto Whalley Avenue, then turns north onto Fitch Street as Whalley Avenue becomes [[Connecticut Route 63|Route 63]]. On Fitch Street, it passes by [[Southern Connecticut State University]], then turns east onto Arch Street after entering the town of [[Hamden (CT)|Hamden]].  It then turns north onto Dixwell Avenue, and intersects the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] ([[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]) at Exit 60. In the center of Hamden, it turns north onto Whitney Avenue.  Proceeding northward, it encounters the northern end of the [[Connecticut Route 40|Route 40]] freeway and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 22|Route 22]] . In [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], it meets the eastern end of [[Connecticut Route 42|Route 42]], and has a brief triplex with Routes [[Connecticut Route 68|68]] and [[Connecticut Route 70|70]].  At the north end of town is a junction with [[Interstate 691|I-691]] at Exit 3.  It then enters [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]], where it has a grade separated intersection with [[Connecticut Route 322|Route 322]] and a connection to [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] east at Exit 29 via SR 597. After passing through the village of [[Plantsville, Connecticut|Plantsville]], it has a junction with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 120|Route 120]] just before downtown, and then becomes Queen Street, a major retail strip. Along Queen Street, it crosses I-84 at Exit 32.  At the [[Plainville, Connecticut|Plainville]] town line, it meets the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 177|Route 177]].  It then meets [[Connecticut Route 372|Route 372]], which leads to eastbound access to the [[Connecticut Route 72|Route 72]] freeway via Hooker Street (SR 511).  After passing under Route 72, Route 10 enters [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]], then has a grade separated intersection with [[US Route 6|US 6]].  Most access to US 6 is provided by Scott Swamp Road (SR 532), except for a direct connection from Route 10 north to US 6 east.  In the center of Farmington, it passes by [[Miss Porter's School]] before intersecting with [[Connecticut Route 4|Route 4]].  It then enters [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]], where it turns west along a brief concurrency with [[US Route 44|US 44]].  In the center of town, it turns north along with [[US Route 202|US 202]] East, which leaves its concurrency with US 44 and duplexes with Route 10 to [[Westfield, Massachusetts]]. In Simsbury, there are junctions with the western end of [[Connecticut Route 185|Route 185]], the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 167|Route 167]], and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 315|Route 315]].  In Granby, there is a brief concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 189|Route 189]], and a junction with [[Connecticut Route 20|Route 20]].

Tolles Memorial Highway in honor of the late Southington native and leader of the Connecticut State Grange (1885\u20131956).\n\n==History==\nRoute 10 originally followed a different route south of [[Granby, Connecticut]], starting in the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]<ref name=\"kurumi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctne.html#ne10|title=Connecticut New England Interstates: NE 10| accessdate=2006-07-10| last=Oglesby| first=Scott| date=2004-09-04| work=Connecticut Roads| publisher=kurumi.com}}</ref> instead of at its current New Haven terminus. It moved to its current alignment along the Connecticut section of the College Highway in 1932, with the former alignment becoming the original [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]].

Grasso Boulevard in the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. It proceeds northward, crossing [[US Route 1|US 1]] and has a brief concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]].  It then turns northwest onto Whalley Avenue, then turns north onto Fitch Street as Whalley Avenue becomes [[Connecticut Route 63|Route 63]]. On Fitch Street, it passes by [[Southern Connecticut State University]], then turns east onto Arch Street after entering the town of [[Hamden (CT)|Hamden]].  It then turns north onto Dixwell Avenue, and intersects the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] ([[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]) at Exit 60. In the center of Hamden, it turns north onto Whitney Avenue.  Proceeding northward, it encounters the northern end of the [[Connecticut Route 40|Route 40]] freeway and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 22|Route 22]] . In [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], it meets the eastern end of [[Connecticut Route 42|Route 42]], and has a brief triplex with Routes [[Connecticut Route 68|68]] and [[Connecticut Route 70|70]].  At the north end of town is a junction with [[Interstate 691|I-691]] at Exit 3.  It then enters [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]], where it has a grade separated intersection with [[Connecticut Route 322|Route 322]] and a connection to [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] east at Exit 29 via SR 597. After passing through the village of [[Plantsville, Connecticut|Plantsville]], it has a junction with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 120|Route 120]] just before downtown, and then becomes Queen Street, a major retail strip. Along Queen Street, it crosses I-84 at Exit 32.  At the [[Plainville, Connecticut|Plainville]] town line, it meets the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 177|Route 177]].  It then meets [[Connecticut Route 372|Route 372]], which leads to eastbound access to the [[Connecticut Route 72|Route 72]] freeway via Hooker Street (SR 511).  After passing under Route 72, Route 10 enters [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]], then has a grade separated intersection with [[US Route 6|US 6]].  Most access to US 6 is provided by Scott Swamp Road (SR 532), except for a direct connection from Route 10 north to US 6 east.  In the center of Farmington, it passes by [[Miss Porter's School]] before intersecting with [[Connecticut Route 4|Route 4]].  It then enters [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]], where it turns west along a brief concurrency with [[US Route 44|US 44]].  In the center of town, it turns north along with [[US Route 202|US 202]] East, which leaves its concurrency with US 44 and duplexes with Route 10 to [[Westfield, Massachusetts]]. In Simsbury, there are junctions with the western end of [[Connecticut Route 185|Route 185]], the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 167|Route 167]], and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 315|Route 315]].  In Granby, there is a brief concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 189|Route 189]], and a junction with [[Connecticut Route 20|Route 20]].  About 3.5 miles later, Routes 10 and 202 cross the [[Massachusetts]] state line into the town of [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]].\n\nThe Southington section of Route 10 was dedicated on Aug. 6, 1960 (and rededicated on Oct. 6, 2007) as the Louis G. Tolles Memorial Highway in honor of the late Southington native and leader of the Connecticut State Grange (1885\u20131956).\n\n==History==\nRoute 10 originally followed a different route south of [[Granby, Connecticut]], starting in the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]<ref name=\"kurumi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctne.html#ne10|title=Connecticut New England Interstates: NE 10| accessdate=2006-07-10| last=Oglesby| first=Scott| date=2004-09-04| work=Connecticut Roads| publisher=kurumi.com}}</ref> instead of at its current New Haven terminus.

Yachts are distinguished from working ships mainly by their leisure purpose.\n\nBoth terms originate from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''[[wiktionary:jacht|jacht]]'' (\"hunt\"). With [[sailboat]]s, it is called [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], and with [[motorboat]]s, it is called [[powerboating]].\n\n==Competitive sailing==\n[[Image:K\u00e4rkinen bridge during P\u00e4ij\u00e4nnepurjehdus 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A yacht race on lake [[P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]] in [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], Finland]]\n[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race B Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013]]\n{{Main|Sailing (sport)}}\n\nThe history of sailing dates back to prehistoric times but the racing of sailing boats is believed to have started in the [[Netherlands]] some time in the 17th century. Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing \"[[yacht]]s\" began to emerge. In 1851, the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] in [[Cowes]] challenged the American yacht ''America''. The race took place in the [[Solent]]. The ''America'' won the race and took the trophy, the [[America's Cup]], back to the US where, held by the [[New York Yacht Club]], it remained until 1983. The cup was then lost to the [[Royal Perth Yacht Club]] of [[Australia]], which entered the ''[[Australia II]]'' into the contest. Meanwhile, yacht racing continued to evolve, with the development of recognised classes of racing yachts, from small [[dinghy sailing|dinghies]] up to huge [[maxi yachts]].\n\nAlthough there are many different types of racing vessels, they can generally be separated into the larger yachts, which are larger and contain facilities for extended voyages, and smaller harbour racing craft such as dinghies and skiffs. Smaller boats are not generally referred to as yachts, although all recreational boats (as opposed to commercial or military vessels) are yachts. These days, [[yacht racing]] and [[dinghy racing]] are common participant sports around the developed world, particularly where favorable wind conditions and access to reasonably sized bodies of water are available. Most yachting is conducted in salt water, but smaller craft can be raced on lakes and even large rivers.\n\n[[Dinghy racing|Dinghy races]] are conducted on sheltered water on smaller craft with crews of between one and three people. The common arrangement for racing boats is the [[sloop]], a boat with one mast. Some dinghies have only one triangular sail, but most have two configured as a [[sloop]]; some dinghies and almost all larger racing boats carry a [[spinnaker]], a large, bulging sail designed for sailing \"with the wind.\"  Most races are conducted between vessels of identical design (\"one design\" racing). In these races, with identical equipment the sailors best able to make use of the ambient conditions win.  \n[[Image:Yacht Antares in Ipswich Marina Suffolk.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A docked [[yacht]]]]\nDinghy designs vary from small, stable, and slow craft for novice sailors to lightweight, high-speed designs that are very difficult for even experienced crews to sail safely and effectively. Australia's [[18ft Skiff|18-foot skiff]] class are the fastest monohull dinghies, reaching speeds of up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour) even in relatively light winds. Sailing has a reputation for being a boring spectator sport,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but skiff racing can be very exciting, particularly in unpredictable conditions where crews struggle to keep their boats upright. Various multi-hull racing classes are even faster. Various one-design dinghy classes are raced at the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nLarger yachts are also raced on harbours, but the most prestigious yacht races are point-to-point long distance races on the open ocean.

Yachts are distinguished from working ships mainly by their leisure purpose.\n\nBoth terms originate from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''[[wiktionary:jacht|jacht]]'' (\"hunt\"). With [[sailboat]]s, it is called [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], and with [[motorboat]]s, it is called [[powerboating]].\n\n==Competitive sailing==\n[[Image:K\u00e4rkinen bridge during P\u00e4ij\u00e4nnepurjehdus 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A yacht race on lake [[P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]] in [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], Finland]]\n[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race B Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013]]\n{{Main|Sailing (sport)}}\n\nThe history of sailing dates back to prehistoric times but the racing of sailing boats is believed to have started in the [[Netherlands]] some time in the 17th century. Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing \"[[yacht]]s\" began to emerge. In 1851, the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] in [[Cowes]] challenged the American yacht ''America''. The race took place in the [[Solent]]. The ''America'' won the race and took the trophy, the [[America's Cup]], back to the US where, held by the [[New York Yacht Club]], it remained until 1983. The cup was then lost to the [[Royal Perth Yacht Club]] of [[Australia]], which entered the ''[[Australia II]]'' into the contest. Meanwhile, yacht racing continued to evolve, with the development of recognised classes of racing yachts, from small [[dinghy sailing|dinghies]] up to huge [[maxi yachts]].\n\nAlthough there are many different types of racing vessels, they can generally be separated into the larger yachts, which are larger and contain facilities for extended voyages, and smaller harbour racing craft such as dinghies and skiffs. Smaller boats are not generally referred to as yachts, although all recreational boats (as opposed to commercial or military vessels) are yachts. These days, [[yacht racing]] and [[dinghy racing]] are common participant sports around the developed world, particularly where favorable wind conditions and access to reasonably sized bodies of water are available. Most yachting is conducted in salt water, but smaller craft can be raced on lakes and even large rivers.\n\n[[Dinghy racing|Dinghy races]] are conducted on sheltered water on smaller craft with crews of between one and three people. The common arrangement for racing boats is the [[sloop]], a boat with one mast. Some dinghies have only one triangular sail, but most have two configured as a [[sloop]]; some dinghies and almost all larger racing boats carry a [[spinnaker]], a large, bulging sail designed for sailing \"with the wind.\"  Most races are conducted between vessels of identical design (\"one design\" racing). In these races, with identical equipment the sailors best able to make use of the ambient conditions win.  \n[[Image:Yacht Antares in Ipswich Marina Suffolk.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A docked [[yacht]]]]\nDinghy designs vary from small, stable, and slow craft for novice sailors to lightweight, high-speed designs that are very difficult for even experienced crews to sail safely and effectively. Australia's [[18ft Skiff|18-foot skiff]] class are the fastest monohull dinghies, reaching speeds of up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour) even in relatively light winds. Sailing has a reputation for being a boring spectator sport,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but skiff racing can be very exciting, particularly in unpredictable conditions where crews struggle to keep their boats upright. Various multi-hull racing classes are even faster. Various one-design dinghy classes are raced at the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nLarger yachts are also raced on harbours, but the most prestigious yacht races are point-to-point long distance races on the open ocean. Bad weather makes even finishing such races a considerable test of equipment and willpower, and from time to time boats and sailors are lost at sea. The longest such events are \"round-the-world\" races which can take months to complete, but better-known are events such as the [[Fastnet race]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] along the east coast of Australia. Large races are usually organized with a first-past-the-post trophy (called \"line honours\") and under a handicap system that adjusts finishing times for the relative speeds of the boats' design, theoretically offering each entrant an equal chance.\n\n==Other yachting events==\n[[File:Loe Real 60 foot Water World Tri 2013 Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|upright|Loe Real 60-foot Water World Tri 2013]]\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}\nWhile sailing groups organize the most active and popular competitive yachting, other boating events are also held worldwide: speed motor boat racing; competitive canoeing, kayaking, and rowing; and navigational contests (generally a test of celestial and landmark-based navigation skills where [[GPS]] and other electronic navigation equipment is disallowed) are among the events which are organized around the world.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[Island platform|island platforms]], only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[Island platform|island platforms]], only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street. Construction was completed on this section in 1915.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|title=New York Division ERA Bulletin May 1961|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|work=Google Docs|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> 86th Street opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street.<ref name=\"Station Opening\">{{cite web|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55570240|title=Subway Running To Eighty-Sixth Street Starts Building Boom In Bay Ridge|date=January 15, 1916|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 29, 2015|newspaper=[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpglAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA252|title=Documents of the Senate of the State of New York|last=Senate|first=New York (State) Legislature|date=January 1, 1917|language=en}}</ref> The station was the original terminal for the line until a one-stop southward extension to [[Bay Ridge\u201395th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Bay Ridge\u201395th Street]] opened on October 25, 1925.<ref name=\"NYTimes-95StBids-March1925\">{{cite web|title=Subway Bids Announced: For 95th Street Terminal, Brooklyn, and Corona Yard|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1925/03/01/105017557.pdf|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=March 1, 1925}}</ref>\n\nThe platforms were originally {{Convert|435|feet|meters}} long, allowing for six-car local trains.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGh7jL3tnTAhUByyYKHZe8BXIQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|last=|first=|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> On February 16, 1925, the [[New York City Board of Transportation]] directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at twelve stations along the Fourth Avenue Line, including this station, to accommodate eight-car trains at the cost of $633,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url-access=subscription|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/02/17/archives/12-bm-t-stations-to-be-lengthehed-transportation-board-orders.html|title=12 B-M.

The original trim lines were replaced with white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain orange-painted cinderblock tiles. The staircases were repaired and new platform edges were installed. The orange cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. The renovation also replaced [[incandescent lighting]] with [[fluorescent lighting]].\n\nBoth platforms have yellow columns that run at regular intervals along the entire length. Alternating ones have the standard black and white station name plate. The columns are round in the center and i-beams at either ends (where the platforms were extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard length of a [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B Division]] train of 600 feet).\n\nThe station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]].<ref name=NYTimes-BMT4Av-86StExt-Feb1912>{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Subway Extension Plan: Fourth Ave. Line to 86th St., Tunnel to Staten Island, and Eventually a Through Route to Coney Island|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/02/16/104891453.pdf|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 28, 2015|date=February 16, 1912}}</ref> As a result of the possibility of the extension of the express tracks, there is space underneath the northbound platform for an additional trackway at this station for the Bay Ridge-bound express track.

Two staircases from each platform go up to a waiting area/crossover, where a [[turnstile]] bank provides entrance/exit from the system. Outside [[fare control]], there is a token booth and two staircases going up to either northern corners of 77th Street and Fourth Avenue. The northwest staircase has its original ornate banisters and railings. Inside the mezzanine, there are mosaics indicating a newsstand and two restrooms, all of which are now defunct, and directing to each platform.<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Bay Ridge|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/bkn/B12-Bay%20Ridge_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Bay Ridge-bound platform has an exit-only at the north end. A single platform-level exit-only turnstiles leads to a double flight staircase that goes up to the northwest corner of 76th Street and Fourth Avenue.<ref name=maps/> The landing here has the station's original trim line with \"77\" tablets on it.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{NYCS ref|http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?216:378|BMT 4th Avenue|77th Street}}\n* Station Reporter \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20150113014240/http://www.stationreporter.net/rtrain.htm R Train]\n* The Subway Nut \u2014 [http://www.subwaynut.com/bmt/77r/index.php 77th Street Pictures]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.629857,-74.025729&spn=0.004088,0.013336&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.629378,-74.02566&panoid=HM9TvIO_xrIbP9RW9nJIZg&cbp=12,61,,0,-0.79 77th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.630068,-74.025235&spn=0.003917,0.013336&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.630109,-74.025361&panoid=Ac8VrSjy956XIlRSqDQFsQ&cbp=12,351.08,,0,4.35 76th Street exit only stairs from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6294136,-74.0255585,3a,75y,48.95h,89.25t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s-g-HD_6mq8xE%2FWG3KOZDoVuI%2FAAAAAAAAYWY%2FSMqO1-7V8aAiWAVBOhRWirOTiBMzIV8ywCLIB!2e4!6s%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2F-g-HD_6mq8xE%2FWG3KOZDoVuI%2FAAAAAAAAYWY%2FSMqO1-7V8aAiWAVBOhRWirOTiBMzIV8ywCLIB%2Fw203-h100-p-k-no%2F!7i7168!8i3584!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1 Platforms from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{NYCS stations navbox by service|lr=y}}\n{{NYCS stations navbox by line|4ave=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:77th Street (Bmt Fourth Avenue Line)}}\n[[Category:BMT Fourth Avenue Line stations]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations located underground]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1916]]\n[[Category:Bay Ridge, Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:1916 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Epicgenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix other errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_Street_station_(BMT_Fourth_Avenue_Line)"}
