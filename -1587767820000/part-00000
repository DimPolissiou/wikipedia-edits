The receptor molecule contains an \u03b1- and \u03b2 subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the \u03b1-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The \u03b2 subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the \u03b2 subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name=\"diabetesincontrol.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin.

He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.<ref name=\"rosenfeld2002\"/>\n[[File:Chart for Elizabeth Hughes (12308739143).jpg|thumb|Chart for Elizabeth Hughes, used to track blood, urine, diet in grams, and dietary prescriptions in grams]]\nOn January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name=\"pmid8409364\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M |url= https://watermark.silverchair.com/253.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlkwggJVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJGMIICQgIBADCCAjsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdwqh6d-CqYzZMUyaAgEQgIICDN34QXbSe17tUE4UR4Q2-p1Fqb7qs9HdcySmv3-MrhphW5tBH-QQlBdWjSPN9xkfnHSF34CHoJxnCpKhNgkzfSVqC_YPSWvoisYwLUbh_4guxUEs927psRK-VUyHHiDX9ZsOJX4jzx9E7nettwm4Wz_IztsMvPyRo2J82vCSOn8YST_LDuSG-iBupyDMNyiAlWOTT9T_JdWYDBCE9_LEznQizX4jBLopfXzeyo73L-vxpTalReUe7n-hDIkjix4HeAkbzntCre1DUQBzQb5apg7vctsWnjas-S0vvJosxMTH39ZxvhvQ8822T6D5KBFpOcg7ILqr1GmNbM_YHqSc4sfgXMtv4z7TRKBGFwLBAIlpMu8hgHmYeZVfRp-JdLuSY4Vmb6FLexU3YyQtb9FCOgU5PWnkP8cjcIXjne-qVKDgFpC3JhqmSGmmzZSvI7YXPwjP8Pu4-lmuvtru8VW8HLfRSA3cOCtx4MCrPVgcgkeiz0XoxjB0mji7PknMoD6z1hvNKFVwYtq60lZf7nVxCF8MjwFFzzuJngaBDGP1cmd3VDWiasTnOl6zPQxo3vuBG0Z2vs934_mqXGlT-ITvtXZbh2gKYNAnXoEsanzQ6PqMQLNBdthbegbvrrejQmFyrIMPciJmUvMY2Ej5Sdc5afAtbC8SqWSttgnaYvIm1lycbJolYWQATXqMH0ir | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u201374 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191103004139/https://watermark.silverchair.com/253.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlkwggJVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJGMIICQgIBADCCAjsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdwqh6d-CqYzZMUyaAgEQgIICDN34QXbSe17tUE4UR4Q2-p1Fqb7qs9HdcySmv3-MrhphW5tBH-QQlBdWjSPN9xkfnHSF34CHoJxnCpKhNgkzfSVqC_YPSWvoisYwLUbh_4guxUEs927psRK-VUyHHiDX9ZsOJX4jzx9E7nettwm4Wz_IztsMvPyRo2J82vCSOn8YST_LDuSG-iBupyDMNyiAlWOTT9T_JdWYDBCE9_LEznQizX4jBLopfXzeyo73L-vxpTalReUe7n-hDIkjix4HeAkbzntCre1DUQBzQb5apg7vctsWnjas-S0vvJosxMTH39ZxvhvQ8822T6D5KBFpOcg7ILqr1GmNbM_YHqSc4sfgXMtv4z7TRKBGFwLBAIlpMu8hgHmYeZVfRp-JdLuSY4Vmb6FLexU3YyQtb9FCOgU5PWnkP8cjcIXjne-qVKDgFpC3JhqmSGmmzZSvI7YXPwjP8Pu4-lmuvtru8VW8HLfRSA3cOCtx4MCrPVgcgkeiz0XoxjB0mji7PknMoD6z1hvNKFVwYtq60lZf7nVxCF8MjwFFzzuJngaBDGP1cmd3VDWiasTnOl6zPQxo3vuBG0Z2vs934_mqXGlT-ITvtXZbh2gKYNAnXoEsanzQ6PqMQLNBdthbegbvrrejQmFyrIMPciJmUvMY2Ej5Sdc5afAtbC8SqWSttgnaYvIm1lycbJolYWQATXqMH0ir|archive-date = 2019-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AC10024|title=Work on diabetes shows progress against disease|last=Toronto star weekly|date=14 Jan 1922|website=University of Toronto Libraries|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10053|title=Early clinical experiences with insulin|last=Fletcher|first=A.

Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.\n\n=== Patent ===\nToward the end of January 1922, tensions mounted between the four \"co-discoverers\" of insulin and Collip briefly threatened to separately [[patent]] his purification process. [[John G. FitzGerald]], director of the non-commercial public health institution [[Connaught Laboratories]], therefore stepped in as peacemaker. The resulting agreement of 25 January 1922 established two key conditions: 1) that the collaborators would sign a contract agreeing not to take out a patent with a commercial pharmaceutical firm during an initial working period with Connaught; and 2) that no changes in research policy would be allowed unless first discussed among FitzGerald and the four collaborators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10033|title=Memorandum in reference to the co-operation of the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratories in the researches conducted by Dr. Banting, Mr. Best and Dr. Collip under the general direction of Professor J.J.R.

However, concerns remained that a private third-party would hijack and monopolize the research (as [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had hinted<ref>{{cite book |last=Bliss | first = Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=The discovery of insulin |date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226058993|edition= 25th anniversary |location=Chicago|pages=132|oclc=74987867|quote=The Lilly company would be delighted to work with Toronto, [[George Henry Alexander Clowes|Clowes]] wrote, and hinted, perhaps intentionally, perhaps not, that Toronto could be bypassed: \"I have thus far refrained from starting work in our laboratories on the field of this question as I was anxious to avoid in any way intruding on the field of yourself and your associates until you had published your results.

To this end, [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] gave valuable advice.

A chemically synthesized C-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the C-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with C-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.\n\n=== Nobel Prizes ===\n\n[[File:C.

The hexamer is about 36000 Da in size. The six molecules are linked together as three dimeric units to form symmetrical molecule.

By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.\n\nEvidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the [[glucose tolerance test]], demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120&nbsp;mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test.

The receptor molecule contains an \u03b1- and \u03b2 subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the \u03b1-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The \u03b2 subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the \u03b2 subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name=\"diabetesincontrol.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November.

By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.<ref name=\"rosenfeld2002\"/>\n[[File:Chart for Elizabeth Hughes (12308739143).jpg|thumb|Chart for Elizabeth Hughes, used to track blood, urine, diet in grams, and dietary prescriptions in grams]]\nOn January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name=\"pmid8409364\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M |url= https://watermark.silverchair.com/253.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlkwggJVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJGMIICQgIBADCCAjsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdwqh6d-CqYzZMUyaAgEQgIICDN34QXbSe17tUE4UR4Q2-p1Fqb7qs9HdcySmv3-MrhphW5tBH-QQlBdWjSPN9xkfnHSF34CHoJxnCpKhNgkzfSVqC_YPSWvoisYwLUbh_4guxUEs927psRK-VUyHHiDX9ZsOJX4jzx9E7nettwm4Wz_IztsMvPyRo2J82vCSOn8YST_LDuSG-iBupyDMNyiAlWOTT9T_JdWYDBCE9_LEznQizX4jBLopfXzeyo73L-vxpTalReUe7n-hDIkjix4HeAkbzntCre1DUQBzQb5apg7vctsWnjas-S0vvJosxMTH39ZxvhvQ8822T6D5KBFpOcg7ILqr1GmNbM_YHqSc4sfgXMtv4z7TRKBGFwLBAIlpMu8hgHmYeZVfRp-JdLuSY4Vmb6FLexU3YyQtb9FCOgU5PWnkP8cjcIXjne-qVKDgFpC3JhqmSGmmzZSvI7YXPwjP8Pu4-lmuvtru8VW8HLfRSA3cOCtx4MCrPVgcgkeiz0XoxjB0mji7PknMoD6z1hvNKFVwYtq60lZf7nVxCF8MjwFFzzuJngaBDGP1cmd3VDWiasTnOl6zPQxo3vuBG0Z2vs934_mqXGlT-ITvtXZbh2gKYNAnXoEsanzQ6PqMQLNBdthbegbvrrejQmFyrIMPciJmUvMY2Ej5Sdc5afAtbC8SqWSttgnaYvIm1lycbJolYWQATXqMH0ir | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u201374 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191103004139/https://watermark.silverchair.com/253.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlkwggJVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJGMIICQgIBADCCAjsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdwqh6d-CqYzZMUyaAgEQgIICDN34QXbSe17tUE4UR4Q2-p1Fqb7qs9HdcySmv3-MrhphW5tBH-QQlBdWjSPN9xkfnHSF34CHoJxnCpKhNgkzfSVqC_YPSWvoisYwLUbh_4guxUEs927psRK-VUyHHiDX9ZsOJX4jzx9E7nettwm4Wz_IztsMvPyRo2J82vCSOn8YST_LDuSG-iBupyDMNyiAlWOTT9T_JdWYDBCE9_LEznQizX4jBLopfXzeyo73L-vxpTalReUe7n-hDIkjix4HeAkbzntCre1DUQBzQb5apg7vctsWnjas-S0vvJosxMTH39ZxvhvQ8822T6D5KBFpOcg7ILqr1GmNbM_YHqSc4sfgXMtv4z7TRKBGFwLBAIlpMu8hgHmYeZVfRp-JdLuSY4Vmb6FLexU3YyQtb9FCOgU5PWnkP8cjcIXjne-qVKDgFpC3JhqmSGmmzZSvI7YXPwjP8Pu4-lmuvtru8VW8HLfRSA3cOCtx4MCrPVgcgkeiz0XoxjB0mji7PknMoD6z1hvNKFVwYtq60lZf7nVxCF8MjwFFzzuJngaBDGP1cmd3VDWiasTnOl6zPQxo3vuBG0Z2vs934_mqXGlT-ITvtXZbh2gKYNAnXoEsanzQ6PqMQLNBdthbegbvrrejQmFyrIMPciJmUvMY2Ej5Sdc5afAtbC8SqWSttgnaYvIm1lycbJolYWQATXqMH0ir|archive-date = 2019-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AC10024|title=Work on diabetes shows progress against disease|last=Toronto star weekly|date=14 Jan 1922|website=University of Toronto Libraries|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10053|title=Early clinical experiences with insulin|last=Fletcher|first=A.

Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.\n\n=== Patent ===\nToward the end of January 1922, tensions mounted between the four \"co-discoverers\" of insulin and Collip briefly threatened to separately [[patent]] his purification process. [[John G. FitzGerald]], director of the non-commercial public health institution [[Connaught Laboratories]], therefore stepped in as peacemaker. The resulting agreement of 25 January 1922 established two key conditions: 1) that the collaborators would sign a contract agreeing not to take out a patent with a commercial pharmaceutical firm during an initial working period with Connaught; and 2) that no changes in research policy would be allowed unless first discussed among FitzGerald and the four collaborators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10033|title=Memorandum in reference to the co-operation of the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratories in the researches conducted by Dr. Banting, Mr. Best and Dr. Collip under the general direction of Professor J.J.R.

However, concerns remained that a private third-party would hijack and monopolize the research (as [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had hinted<ref>{{cite book |last=Bliss | first = Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=The discovery of insulin |date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226058993|edition= 25th anniversary |location=Chicago|pages=132|oclc=74987867|quote=The Lilly company would be delighted to work with Toronto, [[George Henry Alexander Clowes|Clowes]] wrote, and hinted, perhaps intentionally, perhaps not, that Toronto could be bypassed: \"I have thus far refrained from starting work in our laboratories on the field of this question as I was anxious to avoid in any way intruding on the field of yourself and your associates until you had published your results.

To this end, [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] gave valuable advice.

A chemically synthesized C-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the C-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with C-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.\n\n=== Nobel Prizes ===\n\n[[File:C.
