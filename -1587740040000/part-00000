The competition consists of seven objective multiple choice tests, two subjective performance events, and an essay. Academic Decathlon was created by Robert Peterson in 1968 for local schools in [[Orange County, California]] and was expanded nationally in 1981 by Robert Peterson, William Patton, first President of the new USAD Board; and Phillip Bardos, Chairman of the new USAD Board. That year, 17 [[List of states and territories of the United States|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]] participated, a number that has grown to include most of the United States and some international schools. Patton and Bardos served on the board in these two executive positions for the first 10 years of the USAD and not only personally contributed significantly both financially and in personal effort to the organization in those early day when there were no corporate sponsors they, along with Robert Peterson, were the major three factors in bringing corporate sponsors to the program during these challenging growth years eventually resulting in a financially self sustaining organization. In 2015 Academic Decathlon held its first ever International competition in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]].  Once known as United States Academic Decathlon, on March 1, 2013, it began operating as the Academic Decathlon.\n\nAcademic Decathlon is designed to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on a custom calculated [[Grade (education)#United States|grade point average]]: Honors (3.75\u20134.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00\u20133.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00\u20132.99 GPA).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usad.org/Coaches/GPA.aspx|title=GPA Calculation \u2013 United States Academic Decathlon \u2013 Academic Decathlon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usad.org|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> Each team member competes in all ten events against other students in his or her division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the [[United States Academic Decathlon National Championship|national competition]] in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an [[Academic Pentathlon]] for middle schools.\n\nThe ten events require knowledge in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, with the exception of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating between science and social science, is chosen for the [[United States Academic Decathlon#Super Quiz|Super Quiz]]. In addition to the seven [[#Objective events|objective events]], there are three [[#Subjective events|subjective events]] graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.\n\nOver the years, there have been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal involving the [[Charles P. Steinmetz Academic Centre|Steinmetz High School]] team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 [[Illinois]] state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film ''[[Cheaters (2000 film)|Cheaters]]''.<ref name=\"Highbeam Cheaters\" /> Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the amount of time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school.<ref name=\"Bruising Super Bowls\" /> Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden ''Resource Guides'' rather than provide topics for students to research.<ref name=\"LATApril232000\" /><ref name=\"LATApril122000\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Dea Peterson.png|thumb|right|Dr. Robert Dea Peterson, left, receives an award from the Orange County Department of Education for the \"originality\" of the Academic Decathlon concept.]]\n\nAcademic Decathlon was founded in 1968 by Robert Peterson, the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of schools in [[Orange County, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Tanya|title=L.A.

He envisioned a new kind of competition that would give students of different achievement levels a chance to shine. Other academic contests, he said, rewarded only top-level students who didn't need the motivation. Peterson's remedy was to require decathlon teams to include B and C students along with A students for the 10-event contest, which includes math, art and speech. The program gives A students the chance to show their strengths and B students the chance to improve, but most important, it has the power to change C students' lives, said Marvin Cobb, executive director of the California Academic Decathlon.}}</ref> The inaugural competition, held in December 1968, hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools.<ref>{{cite news|title=Students Compete for Orange County Academic Honors|last=Geivet|first=Bob|date=November 28, 1968|page=38|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=103 Participate in pioneer project|page=D2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 6, 1968}}</ref> At first only regional contests were held, organized by the Orange County Academic Decathlon Corporation (OCAD)<ref name=\"2nd AD\">{{cite news|title=Second Academic Decathlon|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Press-Telegram]]|page=80|date=November 5, 1969|location=Long Beach, California}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Howard|title=Statewide Academic Decathlon Urged|page=E7|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 11, 1969}}</ref> with the assistance of the Orange County Department of Education.<ref name=\"Bye OCDoE\">{{cite news|last=Geivet|first=Bob|title=Education department not needed, says Orange Co. jury.|newspaper=Independent|date=December 27, 1971}}</ref> In 1971, when the grand jury recommended that the Orange County Department of Education should no longer play a part in the competition, full control was handed over to the OCAD.<ref name=\"Bye OCDoE\" />\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan USAD letter.png|thumb|left|A letter from President [[Ronald Reagan]] to the competitors at the 1981 United States Academic Decathlon.

The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an [[Advanced Placement Program|advanced placement]], honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA team typically consists of nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since only the top two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally it is to the students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.<ref name=\"eligibility\">{{cite book|title=USAD Study Guide 2003\u20132004|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|year=2003|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n===Levels of competition===\nThere are four official levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively).

The competition consists of seven objective multiple choice tests, two subjective performance events, and an essay. Academic Decathlon was created by Robert Peterson in 1968 for local schools in [[Orange County, California]] and was expanded nationally in 1981 by Robert Peterson, William Patton, first President of the new USAD Board; and Phillip Bardos, Chairman of the new USAD Board. That year, 17 [[List of states and territories of the United States|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]] participated, a number that has grown to include most of the United States and some international schools. Patton and Bardos served on the board in these two executive positions for the first 10 years of the USAD and not only personally contributed significantly both financially and in personal effort to the organization in those early day when there were no corporate sponsors they, along with Robert Peterson, were the major three factors in bringing corporate sponsors to the program during these challenging growth years eventually resulting in a financially self sustaining organization. In 2015 Academic Decathlon held its first ever International competition in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]].  Once known as United States Academic Decathlon, on March 1, 2013, it began operating as the Academic Decathlon.\n\nAcademic Decathlon is designed to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on a custom calculated [[Grade (education)#United States|grade point average]]: Honors (3.75\u20134.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00\u20133.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00\u20132.99 GPA).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usad.org/Coaches/GPA.aspx|title=GPA Calculation \u2013\u00a0United States Academic Decathlon - Academic Decathlon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usad.org|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> Each team member competes in all ten events against other students in his or her division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the [[United States Academic Decathlon National Championship|national competition]] in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an [[Academic Pentathlon]] for middle schools.\n\nThe ten events require knowledge in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, with the exception of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating between science and social science, is chosen for the [[United States Academic Decathlon#Super Quiz|Super Quiz]]. In addition to the seven [[#Objective events|objective events]], there are three [[#Subjective events|subjective events]] graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.\n\nOver the years, there have been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal involving the [[Charles P. Steinmetz Academic Centre|Steinmetz High School]] team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 [[Illinois]] state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film ''[[Cheaters (2000 film)|Cheaters]]''.<ref name=\"Highbeam Cheaters\" /> Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the amount of time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school.<ref name=\"Bruising Super Bowls\" /> Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden ''Resource Guides'' rather than provide topics for students to research.<ref name=\"LATApril232000\" /><ref name=\"LATApril122000\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Dea Peterson.png|thumb|right|Dr. Robert Dea Peterson, left, receives an award from the Orange County Department of Education for the \"originality\" of the Academic Decathlon concept.]]\n\nAcademic Decathlon was founded in 1968 by Robert Peterson, the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of schools in [[Orange County, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Tanya|title=L.A.

He envisioned a new kind of competition that would give students of different achievement levels a chance to shine. Other academic contests, he said, rewarded only top-level students who didn't need the motivation. Peterson's remedy was to require decathlon teams to include B and C students along with A students for the 10-event contest, which includes math, art and speech. The program gives A students the chance to show their strengths and B students the chance to improve, but most important, it has the power to change C students' lives, said Marvin Cobb, executive director of the California Academic Decathlon.}}</ref> The inaugural competition, held in December 1968, hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools.<ref>{{cite news|title=Students Compete for Orange County Academic Honors|last=Geivet|first=Bob|date=November 28, 1968|page=38|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=103 Participate in pioneer project|page=D2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 6, 1968}}</ref> At first only regional contests were held, organized by the Orange County Academic Decathlon Corporation (OCAD)<ref name=\"2nd AD\">{{cite news|title=Second Academic Decathlon|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Press-Telegram]]|page=80|date=November 5, 1969|location=Long Beach, California}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Howard|title=Statewide Academic Decathlon Urged|page=E7|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 11, 1969}}</ref> with the assistance of the Orange County Department of Education.<ref name=\"Bye OCDoE\">{{cite news|last=Geivet|first=Bob|title=Education department not needed, says Orange Co. jury.|newspaper=Independent|date=December 27, 1971}}</ref> In 1971, when the grand jury recommended that the Orange County Department of Education should no longer play a part in the competition, full control was handed over to the OCAD.<ref name=\"Bye OCDoE\" />\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan USAD letter.png|thumb|left|A letter from President [[Ronald Reagan]] to the competitors at the 1981 United States Academic Decathlon.

The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an [[Advanced Placement Program|advanced placement]], honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA team typically consists of nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since only the top two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally it is to the students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.<ref name=\"eligibility\">{{cite book|title=USAD Study Guide 2003\u20132004|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|year=2003|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n===Levels of competition===\nThere are four official levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively).

If the difference between the judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay.

Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive critical response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks to escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation, and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated, and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive critical response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks to escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation, and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated, and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.
