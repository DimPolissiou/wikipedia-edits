Zigrasite was discovered and is only known to occur in the [https://www.mindat.org/loc-3780.html Dunton Quarry] at [[Oxford County, Maine]]. Zigrasite was specifically found in the giant 1972 gem tourmaline-bearing pocket at the Dunton Quarry. Zigrasite is named after [http://www.jameszigras.com/about.html James Zigras] who originally discovered and brought the mineral to attention.\n\n==Occurrence==\nZigrasite is found in association with [[tourmaline]], [[microcline]], [[quartz]], [[albite]], [[beryl]], [[amblygonite]]-[[montebrasite]], [[childrenite]]-[[eosphorite]], and [[apatite]]. It is crystallized as one of the last minerals during pocket formation. The crystals themselves were found perched on a crystal of tourmaline from the giant 1972 pocket at the [https://www.mindat.org/loc-3780.html Dunton Quarry.] The quarry itself is located in a complex rare-element granitic [[pegmatite]] that has produced large quantities of gem tourmaline as well as many other rare phosphate species.<ref name=Haw />\n\n==Physical Properties==\nZigrasite is an offwhite to pale yellow or light tan in color. Zigrasite exhibits a vitreous luster, and a white streak. The Mohs hardness is 3.The measured( Berman Balance) and calculated densities are 2.76(4) and 2.66 g/cm3 respectively. Zigrasite exhibits imperfect cleavage in two directions, parallel to (010) and (001), it shows no parting, is brittle and has hackly fracture. In transmitted light zigrasite is colorless and non-pleochroic, biaxial negative with indices of refraction \u03b1 1.597(1) \u03b2 1.622 (1), \u03b3 1.635 (1). Zigrasite is translucent and shows a light blue to pale yellow [[cathodoluminescence]].<ref name=Haw />\n\n== Crystal Structure==\n\nZigrasite's atomic coordination consists of two phosphorus sites which are solely occupied by phosphorus and tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygen anions with <P-O> distances of 1.532 and 1.533 \u00c5. There are also two magnesium, both of which are occupied solely by Mg and are octahedrally coordinated by two oxygen anions and four (H<sub>2</sub>O) groups with <Mg-O> distances of 2.064 and 2.075 \u00c5. There is a single zircon site solely occupied by zircon and octahedrally coorinated by six oxygen anions with a <Zr-O> distance of 2.065 \u00c5.\n\nThe zircon octahedron shares corners with six (PO<sub>4</sub>) tetrehedra to form a pinwheel cluster. This cluster forms a fragment of a Zr(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> sheet which is parallel to the (001) direction. Alternating tetrahedra point up and down relative to the plane of the sheet. Isolated Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)6) octahedrea are arranged in layers parallel to (001). These layers are intercalated between the [Zr(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] sheets linking through the apical vertices of the (PO<sub>4</sub>) tetrahedra. This structure is formally a heteropolyhedral framework with linkage weaker in the c direction accounting for cleavage.<ref name=Hawt/>\n\n== Chemical Properties ==\nZigrasite is one of 3 compositional variations in zircon phosphate grains from the giant 1972 tourmaline pocket, representing the magnesium phase with [[Mahlmoodite|malhmoodite]] representing the iron phase and an as of yet unnamed calcium-analogue.

This map showed that the highest recorded concentrations of infections were found in [[Alken, Belgium|Alken]] and [[Sint-Truiden]] (Limburg) and [[Qu\u00e9vy]] and [[Honnelles]] (Hainaut). The hotspot in Alken is thought to have been caused by two parties that were allowed to go on in the weekend of 7 March.<ref>{{Cite news|language=nl|url=https://www.tvl.be/nieuws/tvl-nieuws-26-maart-2020-95538|title=TVL Nieuws, 26 maart 2020|publisher=TV Limburg|date=26 March 2020}}</ref> The mayor of Sint-Truiden, who was herself infected by the new corona virus, mentioned she did not understand the reason for the high incidence in her town.

It is based on the [[Beetlejuice|1988 film of the same name]]. The story concerns a deceased couple who try to haunt the new inhabitants of their former home and call for help from a devious bio-[[exorcist]] ghost named [[Betelgeuse]] (pronounced \"Beetlejuice\"), who is summoned by saying his name three times. One of the new inhabitants is a young girl, Lydia, who is dealing with her mother's death and her neglectful father.\n\nThe musical had a tryout at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in October 2018, prior to opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on April 25, 2019. It is produced by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures (a unit of franchise owner [[Warner Bros.]]). The show is scheduled to vacate the Winter Garden on June 6, 2020, but the producers are searching for a new Broadway house. A national tour is expected to begin in 2021.<ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-BEETLEJUICE-Announces-Closing-Date-National-Tour-Will-Launch-in-2021-20191209 Breaking: ''Beetlejuice'' Announces Closing Date; National Tour Will Launch in 2021] BWW News Desk, December 9, 2019</ref>\n\n== Ploot ==\n=== Act I ===\nA group of people at a graveyard mourn the passing of Emily Deetz. Emily's daughter, Lydia, reflects on the death of her mother and her own inability to be noticed by her father, Charles (\"Prologue: Invisible\"). A millennia old demon named Beetlejuice appears and mocks the idea of living life to the fullest, as it will all be worthless once death comes (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing\"). Beetlejuice then tells the audience how as a demon, he is invisible to all living beings unless he gets a living person to say his name three times, and reveals that he has come up with a plan to accomplish this.\n\nBeetlejuice then introduces Adam and Barbara Maitland. They are a normal married couple who desperately want to start a family, but are not emotionally ready and project their insecurities onto their hobbies. As Adam and Barbara reason to themselves why they're not ready for a child, they fall to their deaths through unstable floorboards in their home (\"Ready, Set, Not Yet\"). The ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased'' falls from the sky, but Beetlejuice burns it, wanting the newly deceased Maitlands to haunt their house and get a living person to say his name three times, which will allow him to be seen by all living beings. When Barbara and Adam awaken from their fatal fall and realize that they are dead, Beetlejuice reveals himself to the couple and offers to help them adjust to the Afterlife (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 2\"). Beetlejuice reveals to the Maitlands that the Deetzes have bought their house. He tells them that in order to remain in their house alone, they will have to scare the Deetzes away, and the Maitlands accept his help (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 3\").\n\nWhile moving in, Charles reveals to Lydia that he wants to start a gated community, using the house as a flagship model home, and is having a dinner party with some business friends. Lydia expresses her desire for her mother to return, mentioning the fact that nobody seems to care that she's gone. Praying for her mother to send a sign that she's still there, Lydia vows to make her father acknowledge the fact that tragedy struck their family (\"Dead Mom\"). In the attic, Beetlejuice is trying to teach the Maitlands how to be scary. Despite his best attempts, Barbara and Adam are not scary at all (\"Fright of Their Lives\"). Beetlejuice becomes frustrated with the couple and abandons them, and they vow to scare the Deetz family away themselves (\"Ready Set (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Delia, a woman who Charles hired to be Lydia's life coach and is secretly his lover, tells Lydia how everything happens for a reason, but fails to get her in a positive state of mind (\"No Reason\"). After their session, Lydia meets the Maitlands as they are roaming the house trying to scare the Deetzes. Lydia wants to leave the house just as much as the Maitlands want her family out, so she tries to convince her dad that the house is haunted only to find out that he and Delia are engaged.\n\nFeeling as if Charles is just trying to replace her mother, Lydia flees to the roof, where a depressed Beetlejuice laments that he will never be seen (\"Invisible (Reprise)\"). Beetlejuice becomes ecstatic when he realizes Lydia can see him and tries to convince her not to kill herself, with the intention of getting her to free him from his curse. Lydia teases Beetlejuice, but does not say his name. The Maitlands come to check on Lydia only to be possessed by Beetlejuice into saying positive things about him to further convince Lydia. Upon learning about [[Spirit possession|possession]] and that any ghost can do it, regardless of skill, Lydia decides not to work with Beetlejuice and instead work with the Maitlands to ruin Charles' dinner party (\"Say My Name\").\n\nAt the dinner party, Barbara and Adam possess Charles, Delia, and their guests (\"[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)]]\"). However, instead of being scared, the investors see the ghosts as a selling point, making them more interested in Charles' project. Feeling desperate, Lydia resorts to summoning Beetlejuice. Now visible to the living and able to affect the world around him, he forces the Maitlands to the attic before throwing Charles, Delia and the investors out of the house, much to Lydia's joy.\n\n=== Act II ===\nA [[Girl Scout]] named Sky explains to the audience how she has a heart condition where anything shocking could stop her heart but nevertheless is excited to be a Girl Scout. She rings the doorbell of the Deetzes' house to be greeted by Lydia, who invites her inside (\"Girl Scout\"). Beetlejuice appears and frightens the poor girl into leaving the house. He summons more versions of himself to help Lydia scare every visitor that comes into the house (\"That Beautiful Sound\"). Beetlejuice tells Lydia that now that she lives and works among the dead, she should also follow their rules, and gives her a copy of the ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased''. However, because she is not dead, Lydia can't open it. Lydia realizes the book could help her reunite with her mother, and runs to the attic for Barbara and Adam's help. Feeling once again alone and betrayed, Beetlejuice talks with his clones about how although he can be seen, he wants to leave the house to finally connect with people. He decides he must trick Lydia into marrying him, which will allow him to roam free in the living world (\"That Beautiful Sound (Reprise)\").\n\nIn the attic, Barbara and Adam help Lydia open the ''Handbook'', when they realize they should have gone straight to the Netherworld instead of remaining in their house. Adam opens the door to the Netherworld, but Barbara shuts it and the ''Handbook'', afraid of leaving the house. Lydia berates them because she hoped to use the book to summon her dead mother. She exits the attic in disappointment and anger. Barbara realizes that all of their fear has held the Maitlands back, and she and Adam decide to become bolder and better (\"Barbara 2.0\").\n\nDelia, Charles, and Delia's guru, Otho, re-enter the house to rescue Lydia, bringing a box that can supposedly trap souls. Beetlejuice tricks Lydia by telling her that reading a passage from the book will resurrect her mother, but instead she unknowingly begins an exorcism of Barbara and is forced to agree to marry Beetlejuice to stop it (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 4\"). Beetlejuice stops the exorcism and opens a door to the Netherworld to send the Maitlands away for good, but Lydia jumps through the door, with Charles following.  Enraged that his plan has failed again, he decides to kill everyone instead (\"Good Old Fashioned Wedding\").\n\nLydia and Charles enter the Netherworld to be greeted by Miss Argentina, who along with other Netherworld residents, urges her to return to the living world (\"What I Know Now\"). They then meet Juno, director of Netherworld Customs and Processing, who soon finds out they are still alive. Lydia runs from Juno, and frantically searches for her mother in the Netherworld, but is unable to find her. Charles finds Lydia in distress and reconciles with her (\"Home\").\n\nLydia and Charles return to the house where Beetlejuice is preparing to kill everyone. Lydia plans to trick Beetlejuice by marrying him, as Charles, Delia, and the Maitlands get him ready (\"Creepy Old Guy\"). The wedding brings Beetlejuice to life, allowing Lydia to stab him and kill him again, making him \"Recently Deceased\". Lydia and the Maitlands try to send him back to the Netherworld, but Juno appears, reveals herself as Beetlejuice's mother, and tries to take Lydia back with her. Beetlejuice stands up to Juno, having learned to appreciate life in his brief experience. Juno pretends to be moved by Beetlejuice's speech and throws him out of the house. The Maitlands, Charles, and Delia refuse to let Juno take Lydia. Beetlejuice then crashes through the wall riding a sandworm, which then eats Juno.\n\nBeetlejuice then says his last goodbyes to everyone before leaving. The Deetzes and Maitlands rejoice in their victory and agree to share the house as they clean up and repair the damages done to it. Lydia accepts that although her mother is gone, there is still so much left to enjoy in life (\"[[Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump in the Line]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT NOTABLE(bluelinked).

This reworked incarnation, under Alex Timbers's direction, breathes slightly more enjoyably even as it remains too faithful to the pumped-up inclinations of book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer-lyricist Eddie Perfect.

This may be of more concern to overly entertained theater analysts than to those musical-theater enthusiasts who thrive on the supercharged exertions of an ensemble on hyperdrive.

It is based on the [[Beetlejuice|1988 film of the same name]]. The story concerns a deceased couple who try to haunt the new inhabitants of their former home and call for help from a devious bio-[[exorcist]] ghost named [[Betelgeuse]] (pronounced \"Beetlejuice\"), who is summoned by saying his name three times. One of the new inhabitants is a young girl, Lydia, who is dealing with her mother's death and her neglectful father.\n\nThe musical had a tryout at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]] in October 2018, prior to opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on April 25, 2019. It is produced by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures (a unit of franchise owner [[Warner Bros.]]). The show is scheduled to vacate the Winter Garden on June 6, 2020, but the producers are searching for a new Broadway house. A national tour is expected to begin in 2021.<ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-BEETLEJUICE-Announces-Closing-Date-National-Tour-Will-Launch-in-2021-20191209 Breaking: ''Beetlejuice'' Announces Closing Date; National Tour Will Launch in 2021] BWW News Desk, December 9, 2019</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act I ===\nA group of people at a graveyard mourn the passing of Emily Deetz. Emily's daughter, Lydia, reflects on the death of her mother and her own inability to be noticed by her father, Charles (\"Prologue: Invisible\"). A millennia old demon named Beetlejuice appears and mocks the idea of living life to the fullest, as it will all be worthless once death comes (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing\"). Beetlejuice then tells the audience how as a demon, he is invisible to all living beings unless he gets a living person to say his name three times, and reveals that he has come up with a plan to accomplish this.\n\nBeetlejuice then introduces Adam and Barbara Maitland. They are a normal married couple who desperately want to start a family, but are not emotionally ready and project their insecurities onto their hobbies. As Adam and Barbara reason to themselves why they're not ready for a child, they fall to their deaths through unstable floorboards in their home (\"Ready, Set, Not Yet\"). The ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased'' falls from the sky, but Beetlejuice burns it, wanting the newly deceased Maitlands to haunt their house and get a living person to say his name three times, which will allow him to be seen by all living beings. When Barbara and Adam awaken from their fatal fall and realize that they are dead, Beetlejuice reveals himself to the couple and offers to help them adjust to the Afterlife (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 2\"). Beetlejuice reveals to the Maitlands that the Deetzes have bought their house. He tells them that in order to remain in their house alone, they will have to scare the Deetzes away, and the Maitlands accept his help (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 3\").\n\nWhile moving in, Charles reveals to Lydia that he wants to start a gated community, using the house as a flagship model home, and is having a dinner party with some business friends. Lydia expresses her desire for her mother to return, mentioning the fact that nobody seems to care that she's gone. Praying for her mother to send a sign that she's still there, Lydia vows to make her father acknowledge the fact that tragedy struck their family (\"Dead Mom\"). In the attic, Beetlejuice is trying to teach the Maitlands how to be scary. Despite his best attempts, Barbara and Adam are not scary at all (\"Fright of Their Lives\"). Beetlejuice becomes frustrated with the couple and abandons them, and they vow to scare the Deetz family away themselves (\"Ready Set (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Delia, a woman who Charles hired to be Lydia's life coach and is secretly his lover, tells Lydia how everything happens for a reason, but fails to get her in a positive state of mind (\"No Reason\"). After their session, Lydia meets the Maitlands as they are roaming the house trying to scare the Deetzes. Lydia wants to leave the house just as much as the Maitlands want her family out, so she tries to convince her dad that the house is haunted only to find out that he and Delia are engaged.\n\nFeeling as if Charles is just trying to replace her mother, Lydia flees to the roof, where a depressed Beetlejuice laments that he will never be seen (\"Invisible (Reprise)\"). Beetlejuice becomes ecstatic when he realizes Lydia can see him and tries to convince her not to kill herself, with the intention of getting her to free him from his curse. Lydia teases Beetlejuice, but does not say his name. The Maitlands come to check on Lydia only to be possessed by Beetlejuice into saying positive things about him to further convince Lydia. Upon learning about [[Spirit possession|possession]] and that any ghost can do it, regardless of skill, Lydia decides not to work with Beetlejuice and instead work with the Maitlands to ruin Charles' dinner party (\"Say My Name\").\n\nAt the dinner party, Barbara and Adam possess Charles, Delia, and their guests (\"[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)]]\"). However, instead of being scared, the investors see the ghosts as a selling point, making them more interested in Charles' project. Feeling desperate, Lydia resorts to summoning Beetlejuice. Now visible to the living and able to affect the world around him, he forces the Maitlands to the attic before throwing Charles, Delia and the investors out of the house, much to Lydia's joy.\n\n=== Act II ===\nA [[Girl Scout]] named Sky explains to the audience how she has a heart condition where anything shocking could stop her heart but nevertheless is excited to be a Girl Scout. She rings the doorbell of the Deetzes' house to be greeted by Lydia, who invites her inside (\"Girl Scout\"). Beetlejuice appears and frightens the poor girl into leaving the house. He summons more versions of himself to help Lydia scare every visitor that comes into the house (\"That Beautiful Sound\"). Beetlejuice tells Lydia that now that she lives and works among the dead, she should also follow their rules, and gives her a copy of the ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased''. However, because she is not dead, Lydia can't open it. Lydia realizes the book could help her reunite with her mother, and runs to the attic for Barbara and Adam's help. Feeling once again alone and betrayed, Beetlejuice talks with his clones about how although he can be seen, he wants to leave the house to finally connect with people. He decides he must trick Lydia into marrying him, which will allow him to roam free in the living world (\"That Beautiful Sound (Reprise)\").\n\nIn the attic, Barbara and Adam help Lydia open the ''Handbook'', when they realize they should have gone straight to the Netherworld instead of remaining in their house. Adam opens the door to the Netherworld, but Barbara shuts it and the ''Handbook'', afraid of leaving the house. Lydia berates them because she hoped to use the book to summon her dead mother. She exits the attic in disappointment and anger. Barbara realizes that all of their fear has held the Maitlands back, and she and Adam decide to become bolder and better (\"Barbara 2.0\").\n\nDelia, Charles, and Delia's guru, Otho, re-enter the house to rescue Lydia, bringing a box that can supposedly trap souls. Beetlejuice tricks Lydia by telling her that reading a passage from the book will resurrect her mother, but instead she unknowingly begins an exorcism of Barbara and is forced to agree to marry Beetlejuice to stop it (\"The Whole \"Being Dead\" Thing, Pt. 4\"). Beetlejuice stops the exorcism and opens a door to the Netherworld to send the Maitlands away for good, but Lydia jumps through the door, with Charles following.  Enraged that his plan has failed again, he decides to kill everyone instead (\"Good Old Fashioned Wedding\").\n\nLydia and Charles enter the Netherworld to be greeted by Miss Argentina, who along with other Netherworld residents, urges her to return to the living world (\"What I Know Now\"). They then meet Juno, director of Netherworld Customs and Processing, who soon finds out they are still alive. Lydia runs from Juno, and frantically searches for her mother in the Netherworld, but is unable to find her. Charles finds Lydia in distress and reconciles with her (\"Home\").\n\nLydia and Charles return to the house where Beetlejuice is preparing to kill everyone. Lydia plans to trick Beetlejuice by marrying him, as Charles, Delia, and the Maitlands get him ready (\"Creepy Old Guy\"). The wedding brings Beetlejuice to life, allowing Lydia to stab him and kill him again, making him \"Recently Deceased\". Lydia and the Maitlands try to send him back to the Netherworld, but Juno appears, reveals herself as Beetlejuice's mother, and tries to take Lydia back with her. Beetlejuice stands up to Juno, having learned to appreciate life in his brief experience. Juno pretends to be moved by Beetlejuice's speech and throws him out of the house. The Maitlands, Charles, and Delia refuse to let Juno take Lydia. Beetlejuice then crashes through the wall riding a sandworm, which then eats Juno.\n\nBeetlejuice then says his last goodbyes to everyone before leaving. The Deetzes and Maitlands rejoice in their victory and agree to share the house as they clean up and repair the damages done to it. Lydia accepts that although her mother is gone, there is still so much left to enjoy in life (\"[[Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump in the Line]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT NOTABLE(bluelinked).

This reworked incarnation, under Alex Timbers's direction, breathes slightly more enjoyably even as it remains too faithful to the pumped-up inclinations of book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer-lyricist Eddie Perfect. This means that the eager-to-please quotient of a musical about the quest by a bevy of souls, alive and dead, to alleviate loneliness, is still amped up a bit too frantically. This may be of more concern to overly entertained theater analysts than to those musical-theater enthusiasts who thrive on the supercharged exertions of an ensemble on hyperdrive.

By far, the most famous was his realistic drama ''[[Terra baixa]]'' (''Lowlands'', also translated as ''Martha of the Lowlands''). Written in 1896, it quickly became an international sensation. The play was translated into 15 different languages and the Spanish translation was presented regularly for a period of thirty years by [[Enric Borr\u00e0s]]'s theatre throughout Spain and Latin America. In English, the play received three Broadway productions between 1903 and 1936.\n\nIn addition to being a popular stage play, ''Terra baixa'' was made into six films, including a silent film in the United States, entitled ''\"Martha of the Lowlands\"'' (1914) and [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Tiefland (film)|Tiefland]]'' (1954). Furthermore, it served as the source material for two operas: [[Eugen d'Albert]]'s German opera ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'' (1903) and [[Fernand Le Borne]]'s ''La Catalane'' (French).\n\nPlaywright \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0 was nominated twenty-three times for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1901\u20131950|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3713 |publisher=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> though he never won, due to controversy about the political significance of the gesture. He was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in 1904, to be shared with the [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] writer [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]], in recognition of their contributions to literature in non-official languages.

Sebasti\u00e0 must marry a woman of prominence to keep his land and inheritance. To squelch gossip of his relationship with Martha but still keep her as his lover, Sebasti\u00e0 marries her off to the unsuspecting Manelic, a young shepherd from the Pyrenees, and sets the newly weds up in the house attached to the town's mill. Martha finds herself torn between her old domineering lover and her new caring husband.\n\n==''La filla del mar''==\nAnother well-known work by Guimer\u00e0  is the play ''La filla del mar'' (The daughter of the sea, 1900), that recounts the story of Agata (Agate).\n\nHer name is that of a precious stone, in sharp contrast to the contempt in which she is held.\n\nHer uncertain origins, and the fact that she had been born \"among Moors\" renders her an object of hate, branded as a heretic.\n\nOne of the few people who does not exclude her is Baltasanet, who states that \"When we are born, we are all Moors\". Agata is perfectly conscious of the fact that she is considered a \"nobody\" and a \"nuisance\". \"What evil have I done, that everyone despises me?\", she asks. The discrimination she faces leads ultimately to her death.\n\nAgata feels attracted by the sea, which seems to be calling out to her, in the voices of her parents.\n\nFor her there is a symbolic opposition between sea and earth, the latter being all about misery and tears, whereas the sea harbours peacefulness and truth. Drowning, for her, would be a return to the 'amniotic fluid' of the sea from which she was born.\n\nLike a sailor, she is strong, brave, and vital. At the same time she is sensitive, and when she finds in Pere M\u00e0rtir the affection she had desperately lacked, they are able to connect. She excuses his past as a ladies' man, but, overcome by jealousy, threatens him with death if he relapses.\n\nThe story of \u00c0gata involves numerous literary allusions and archetypes, from mythological aquatic characters, to the legend of Sappho committing suicide by throwing herself from a cliff into the sea.\n\n== Tributes ==\nThe main theater of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the oldest on the [[Canary Islands]], is called [[Teatro Guimer\u00e1]] after this playwright.<ref>[http://www.teatroguimera.es TEATRO GUIMER\u00c1 - Teatro, danza y m\u00fasica en Santa Cruz de Tenerife]</ref> On the facade of the [[Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] are a number of marble busts representing famous tinerfe\u00f1os, among them \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0.\n\nAvenida \u00c1ngel Guimer\u00e1, where the theater is located, is also named after the playwright and poet, as this was the street on which he was born.\n\nA seated bronze statue of \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0 was made in Catalonia in 1920 by Josep Cardona i Furr\u00f3 (1878-1923).

The shakes have half the sugar and only 10% of the fat of commercial fast-food shakes. Schools need a milk shake machine or soft-serve ice cream machine to serve the milkshakes.

Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 196\u2013197)</ref>\n\nThe automation of milkshakes developed in the 1930s, after the invention of [[freon]]-cooled refrigerators provided a safe, reliable way of automatically making and dispensing ice cream. In 1936, inventor Earl Prince used the basic concept behind the freon-cooled automated ice cream machine to develop the Multimixer, a \"five-spindled mixer that could produce five milkshakes at once, all automatically, and dispense them at the pull of a lever into awaiting paper cups.\" {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn the late 1930s, several newspaper articles show that the term \"frosted\" was used to refer to milkshakes made with ice cream. In 1937, the ''[[Denton Journal]]'' in Maryland stated that \"For a 'frosted' shake, add a dash of your favorite ice cream.\" In 1939, the ''Mansfield News'' in Ohio stated that \"A frosted beverage, in the vernacular, is something good to which ice cream has been added.

Soda fountain staff had their own jargon, such as \"Burn One All the Way\" (chocolate malted with chocolate ice cream), \"Twist It, Choke It, and Make It Cackle\" (chocolate malted with an egg), \"Shake One in the Hay\" (a strawberry shake), and a \"White Cow\" (a vanilla milkshake).<ref>[http://www.newyorkfirst.com/gifts/1038.html Shake One in the Hay.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316131554/http://www.newyorkfirst.com/gifts/1038.html |date=March 16, 2010 }} New York First</ref> In the 1950s, a milkshake machine salesman named [[Ray Kroc]] bought exclusive rights to the 1930s-era Multimixer milkshake maker from inventor Earl Prince, and went on to use automated milkshake machines<ref>[http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume7/issue1/features/cull.html Happy Meals in Kitty Hawk: How the Wright Brothers Spawned a Burger Nation].

In Australia, [[milk bar]]s had grown popular and milkshakes were normally served lightly whipped and often in the aluminium or stainless steel cups in which they were prepared. In addition to more conventional flavors, spearmint and lime flavored milkshakes became popular in Australia.\n\n===2000s\u2013present===\n[[File:Strawberry-Mint Liquid Nitrogen Shake at HBurger in Denver.jpg|thumb|upright|This milkshake was made using [[liquid nitrogen]].

The shakes have half the sugar and only 10% of the fat of commercial fast-food shakes. Schools need a milk shake machine or soft-serve ice cream machine to serve the milkshakes. The milkshakes also have added fiber and other nutrients, and they have much less lactose, which makes the shakes appropriate for some lactose-intolerant people.<ref>Konstance, Richard P.

The community was allowed a degree of self-administration, and witnessed a period of prosperity and cultural effervescence during the 19th century.\n\nThe majority of R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi's Jewish population was exterminated during the [[Holocaust]]. Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the [[Octavian Goga]] government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]]. In October 1941, all Jews present in R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi (more than 10,000) were deported to [[concentration camp]]s in [[Transnistria]].<ref name=\"JEWISH_RADAUTI\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_romania/rom2_00516.html | title = Translation of ''R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi'' chapter from ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Communities in Romania'', Vol. 2 | year = 1980 | accessdate = January 29, 2013 | publisher = Yad Vashem, Jerusalim }}</ref>\n\n==Bogdana Monastery==\nThe Princely Church at R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i contained the graves of [[Bogdan I]] and his son [[La\u0163cu]], both [[Voivode]]s/[[Prince]]s of [[Moldavia]], as well as a later ruler, [[Roman I of Moldavia]].
