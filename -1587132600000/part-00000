Then we say that a subset ''D'' of ''X'' is a '''[[Absolutely convex set|disk]]''' if it is [[convex set|convex]] and [[balanced set|balanced]]. The disk ''D'' is necessarily [[absorbing set|absorbing]] in the space <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> and so its [[Minkowski functional]] forms a seminorm on this space, which is denoted by <math>\\mu_D</math> or by ''p<sub>D</sub>'' and defined by <math>\\mu_D(x) := \\inf_{x \\in \\lambda B} | \\lambda|</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=370}}  When we give <math>\\operatorname{span} D</math> the topology induced by this seminorm, we denote the resulting topological vector space by <math>X_D</math>.

By the age of 10, he had passed the audition for the Mitchell Boys Choir (founded by [[Bob Mitchell]]) in Hollywood, California where he studied music theory from 1974 to 1981. In 1977, whilst still attending the Mitchell Boys, he performed vocals on composer [[Ennio Morricone]]\u2019s [[Exorcist II: The Heretic]] soundtrack as well as contributing to the made for TV American movie [[The Possessed (1977 film)]] directed by [[Jerry Thorpe]]. In 1981 he performed and appeared in the Universal pic [[All Night Long (1981 film)]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Gene Hackman]] During this period, Darling also performed in [[La boh\u00e8me]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Musical Career==\nIn 1985, Darling formed his first band [[Antix (band)]] using his Greg Clewley family name. The band signed to [[Enigma Records]] and released the mini-album Get Up, Get Happy. In 1987, Darling met [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Poison (American band)]] and [[Motley Crue]] manager [[Vicky Hamilton]] who introduced him to producer Bob Rose and American [[Glam metal]]/[[Glam punk]] band [[Faster Pussycat]] who she also managed. Darling subsequently played piano and provided backing vocals for the band\u2019s 1987 [[Faster Pussycat (album)|self-titled debut album]].\nIn 1988 Darling recorded demos with his new band, Darling Cruel, and was offered a record contract by [[George Michael]] who had recently set up his own Mika Records imprint via [[Polygram]]. Soon after this Polygram signed Darling Cruel directly and, later that year, the band recorded their debut album \"Passion Crimes\" at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Monmouth, Wales. A year later Darling Cruel signed to George Michael\u2019s management company, Lippmann/Kahane.<ref name=\"LAtimes\"/>\n\nIn September 1989, Darling Cruel released their debut album \"Passion Crimes\". The album garnered great reviews and Darling\u2019s extraordinary vocal range was officially acknowledged for the first time \u2013 \u201ca man with a range and vision that is as unique in approach as W. Axl Rose of Guns n\u2019 Roses ..twisting with the confidence of Terence Trent Darby before contortioning into a mutoid David Coverdale\u201d.<ref name=\"MetalHammer\"/> \"Everything\u2019s Over\", the first single lifted from the album, secured active rotation on MTV for six months whilst the album entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \"Love Child\" became the second single to be released from the album.\n \nIn 1990 Polygram president Dick Asher resigned whilst Darling Cruel recorded new album \"Movies For The Mind\" in New York with producer [[Tony Visconti]]. New Polygram president [[Alain Levy]] \u2013 champion of [[Rhythm and blues|R \u2018n\u2019 B]] and [[Hip hop music|Rap music]] \u2013 disassociated himself from the new record that was subsequently shelved. In 1991, Darling Cruel toured the US, opening for [[The Moody Blues]] before dismembering. Darling remained with Polygram to co-write with [[Holly Knight]]. Together they produced \"Don\u2019t Like The Way You Look At My Love\" for [[Russ Irwin]], released on [[SBK Records]]. A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios. Between 2001 and 2004 he wrote music for DL Music and produced and wrote instrumentals for TV shows [[American Idol]] and Behind The Scenes.\n\nIn 2005, Darling signed a worldwide publishing and recording deal with Toronto-based FOD Records \u2013 set up and run by Dean Manjuris and Bob Rose - and, in 2006, released his debut album Shell.

By the age of 10, he had passed the audition for the Mitchell Boys Choir (founded by [[Bob Mitchell]]) in Hollywood, California where he studied music theory from 1974 to 1981. In 1977, whilst still attending the Mitchell Boys, he performed vocals on composer [[Ennio Morricone]]\u2019s [[Exorcist II: The Heretic]] soundtrack as well as contributing to the made for TV American movie [[The Possessed (1977 film)]] directed by [[Jerry Thorpe]]. In 1981 he performed and appeared in the Universal pic [[All Night Long (1981 film)]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Gene Hackman]] During this period, Darling also performed in [[La boh\u00e8me]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Musical Career==\nIn 1985, Darling formed his first band [[Antix (band)]] using his Greg Clewley family name. The band signed to [[Enigma Records]] and released the mini-album Get Up, Get Happy. In 1987, Darling met [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Poison (American band)]] and [[Motley Crue]] manager [[Vicky Hamilton]] who introduced him to producer Bob Rose and American [[Glam metal]]/[[Glam punk]] band [[Faster Pussycat]] who she also managed. Darling subsequently played piano and provided backing vocals for the band\u2019s 1987 [[Faster Pussycat (album)|self-titled debut album]].\nIn 1988 Darling recorded demos with his new band, Darling Cruel, and was offered a record contract by [[George Michael]] who had recently set up his own Mika Records imprint via [[Polygram]]. Soon after this Polygram signed Darling Cruel directly and, later that year, the band recorded their debut album \"Passion Crimes\" at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Monmouth, Wales. A year later Darling Cruel signed to George Michael\u2019s management company, Lippmann/Kahane.<ref name=\"LAtimes\"/>\n\nIn September 1989, Darling Cruel released their debut album \"Passion Crimes\". The album garnered great reviews and Darling\u2019s extraordinary vocal range was officially acknowledged for the first time \u2013 \u201ca man with a range and vision that is as unique in approach as W. Axl Rose of Guns n\u2019 Roses ..twisting with the confidence of Terence Trent Darby before contortioning into a mutoid David Coverdale\u201d.<ref name=\"MetalHammer\"/> \"Everything\u2019s Over\", the first single lifted from the album, secured active rotation on MTV for six months whilst the album entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \"Love Child\" became the second single to be released from the album.\n \nIn 1990 Polygram president Dick Asher resigned whilst Darling Cruel recorded new album \"Movies For The Mind\" in New York with producer [[Tony Visconti]]. New Polygram president [[Alain Levy]] \u2013 champion of [[Rhythm and blues|R \u2018n\u2019 B]] and [[Hip hop music|Rap music]] \u2013 disassociated himself from the new record that was subsequently shelved. In 1991, Darling Cruel toured the US, opening for [[The Moody Blues]] before dismembering. Darling remained with Polygram to co-write with [[Holly Knight]]. Together they produced \"Don\u2019t Like The Way You Look At My Love\" for [[Russ Irwin]], released on [[SBK Records]]. A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios.
