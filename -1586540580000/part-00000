Quietdrive released their first album, ''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'', on May 30, 2006, on [[Epic Records]]. In April 2008, Quietdrive left Epic Records and released an album titled ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, with the [[The Militia Group|Militia Group]]. In 2009, they left Militia Group and released an independent EP titled ''Close Your Eyes'' on their own record label, [[Sneaker 2 Bombs Records]]. Their third full-length album, ''[[Quietdrive (album)|Quietdrive]]'', was released on December 14, 2010, and a full-length album, ''Up or Down'', on April 24, 2012.  ''[[The Ghost of What You Used to Be]]'' was released on December 16, 2014.\n\n==History==\nThe original members of the band attended [[Sultana High School]] in Hesperia, California, and in ninth grade, Brandon Lanier started telling Droo Hastings that he was a great drummer  and that they should start a band with him and his friend Justin Bonhiver. Initially, the band was a [[Trio (music)|trio]] with Hastings as lead singer and bass guitar, Lanier playing drums, and Bonhiver on guitar.<ref name=\"sctimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080424/ENT/104240050/1005 |title=23rd Annual Mississippi Music Fest |publisher=St. Cloud Times |last= Hammer |first= Adam |date= 2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The band posted an audition for a lead singer on [[MP3.com]]. [[Kevin Truckenmiller]] entered the band after submitting his solo work, including an early incarnation of the song \"I Go Both Ways\", which was named after their friend, Jennings Lane. Matt Kirby began attending [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] with Truckenmiller.<ref name=\"emopunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |title=In person Interview |date=2006-05-30 |last=Jones |first=Liz |publisher=Emotional Punk |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065636/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}</ref> The group eventually joined together and formed in 2002 under the name \"Sneaker 2 Bombs,\" a hard rock band which reflected the evolving Minneapolis local music scene.<ref name=\"emopunk\"/>\n\nQuietdrive initially built a following at [[The Garage (Burnsville, Minnesota)|The Garage]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=Kevin (ed.) \n |url=http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |title=Best of the City Pages 2006 \n |date=2006-04-25 \n |publisher=City Pages \n |accessdate=2008-05-27 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515034110/http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |archivedate=May 15, 2006 \n}}</ref>{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2008}} The band pursued music venues in Minneapolis but found better connection with younger crowds and stayed between suburban and city clubs. As Quietdrive, the band recorded demo songs with Eric Trelstad.  These songs were heard by Will.I.Am from Black Eyed Peas during a visit to Minneapolis recording studio IPR.  Will arranged for the band to retain attorney Peter Lewitt and to showcase in Los Angeles but executives from Interscope passed on signing the band.  Afterwards, Truckenmiller began strongly to consider reorganizing the band with inclusion of Matt Kirby.  By April 2004, Kirby was officially made a band member and Sneaker2bombs began live performances in local bars including The Lodge.   Truckenmiller and Kirby also performed as an acoustic duo at the graduation night for Holy Angels Academy High School in June 2004.\n\nThe band put Sneaker2bombs recordings on music industry mp3 sites and Chris Foitle, an intern at Epic Records in Santa Monica, began contacting Bonhiver and Truckenmiller.  In July 2004, Epic arranged to see the band perform in Minneapolis with the assistance of Greg Sheldon.  Pete Giberga, a Vice President of A&R at Epic's Santa Monica's office, flew in and decided to sign the band.  Giberga was familiar with Sui Generis, a young emo act from Apple Valley who Giberga unsuccessfully pursued for Epic in 2003.  In early August 2004, Giberga contacted attorney Lewitt and offered a deal memo binding Quietdrive to Epic.  Truckenmiller consented.   Over the next four months, the band sought advice from industry veterans including Danny Nozell, and emerged with the decision to dismiss Lewitt, hire Sui Generis attorney Jeff Biederman, and negotiate a long form contract with Epic.  During this time, Atlantic Records also expressed interest in meeting with the band but that interest was held in check by Epic's deal memo and Epic's executive intimations that it would pursue legal action if it lost the band to another label.\n\nIn November 2004, the band flew to New York and met with Epic department heads, including head of A&R Ben Goldman, label chief Steve Barnett, head of marketing Lee Stimmel, and radio-promo heads Joel Klaiman and [[Jacqueline Saturn]].  Following that visit, final terms were negotiated and a long form was signed.\n\n''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'' is Quietdrive's first [[long play|LP]], produced, engineered and mixed by Matt Kirkwold and James Harley of World Record Productions with additional mixing by [[Chris Lord-Alge]] and [[Mark Endert]], was released in May 2006. Its first single was \"Rise from the Ashes\" and was used on [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[NHL 07]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, the band released a cover version of the [[Cyndi Lauper]] song \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" to nationwide radio play. The song is also used for the [[WNBA]] \"Have You Seen Her?\" advertising campaign. The song became a minor hit on pop radio, reaching No.&nbsp;25 on the syndicated ''[[American Top 40]]'' countdown show. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 2006 feature film, ''[[John Tucker Must Die]]'', and in the trailer for the 2008 remake of the film ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]''.\n\nAfter the CD release into 2007, the band had a lengthy US tour and was the \"Artist of the Month\" on [[Xbox Live]] in January 2007. Quietdrive, with producers Kirkwold and Harley, released a new single titled \"Pretend\" on their  AbsolutePunk.net page in early 2007 for fans. Though the band garnered success with Epic Records, in April 2008 they cancelled their contract, partly citing the restricting management of the major music industry.<ref name=\"sctimes\"/>\n\nQuietdrive released their second full-length album ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, and supported this album with an extensive tour with announced dates in the US, UK and Japan.<ref name='Deliverance Tour'>{{cite web|url=http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/tour |title=Quietdrive Deliverance Tour |accessdate=2008-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913233455/http://quietdrivemusic.com/tour |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nQuietdrive released their EP \"Close Your Eyes\" independently on October 13, 2009. Their first single was \"Jessica\". Robby Starbuck produced the music video, which premiered on buzznet.com on December 15, 2009.  Shortly after the release of ''Close Your Eyes'', Matt Kirby decided to leave the band.  In the summer of 2010, bassist Droo Hastings also decided to leave Quietdrive while the band was touring in support of ''Close Your Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/quietdrive|title=Quietdrive - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatt Kirby left the band due his first child being born. He became the band's manager shortly after. Several guitarists filled in for him at live shows. including Ryan Irey and Jack Swagger (Machine 22).\n\nThe band released their [[Quietdrive (album)|self-titled]] third studio album on December 14, 2010.<ref>http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2010 Droo Hastings left the band to pursue his own music and he also was expecting his first child. The band didn't make an official announcement at first. They took him off the official members area on Facebook and fans speculated that he had left the band and the band confirmed soon after. Droo still remains good friends with all the members of Quietdrive and frequents their shows in the Twin Cities.\n\nThey were looking for a full-time guitarist and bassist to fill Kirby and Droo's positions in the band. Will Caesar auditioned sometime in mid-2010 and Brice Niehaus auditioned for bassist soon after that. They both played in Milwaukee in August 2010 for the first time with the whole band which Will has said was basically their final audition for the band. Soon after that they were both added as official members of Quietdrive on their official Facebook page.\n\nQuietdrive began a fundraising project on [[Kickstarter]], and on July 31, 2011, just two hours before their deadline, the band exceeded their goal of $15,000 to record the cover album \"Your Record Our Spin\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref>  The band began recording in October 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin/posts|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref> and intended the album to include 10 songs voted on by fans and one original song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102236/http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> In late December 2011, fans who donated $10 or more via Kickstarter began receiving their copy of the album; the final version only included the ten songs voted on by Kickstarter-donating fans, with an original eleventh track available later for digital download via a password distributed to those who had donated to the fundraising campaign.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Quietdrive released their single \"Until the End (Acoustic)\" on iTunes, with all proceeds going to the Dean Randazzo Cancer Foundation.  A  music video was released on YouTube that same day, featuring the Grand Nationals, Colin Kassekert and [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nOn April 24, 2012, Quietdrive released their fourth studio album titled ''Up or Down''. Originally it was going to be an eight-song EP that was to be released late 2011 or early 2012. The release was changed to late spring 2012 due to unforeseen circumstances. In the past, Truckenmiller was the primary songwriter but due to Caesar's writing experience in previous jobs him and Truckenmiller cowrote many of the songs on the album.\n\nOn October 10, 2012, Bonhiver announced he was leaving the band to pursue other interests<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151104181103506&set=a.144580528505.116347.6016878505&type=1|title=Quietdrive - Goodbyes are never easy.

It was originally planned to release it in mid-2014 but they delayed it to December to release it in the U.S. shortly before their annual holiday show.\n\nIn December 2014, Caesar quit as a full-time member of Quietdrive but still plays if no one else is available. In 2015 they did not have plans to release another record but still tour occasionally. The members of the band rotate depending on who is available, including previous members Justin Bonhiver, Droo Hastings, and Matt Kirby.\n\nOn April 23, 2019, Quietdrive announced that they were reuniting for their first public show in nearly 4 years, and promised \"a lot of surprises\" over the coming summer and fall.<ref>{{Cite

Quietdrive released their first album, ''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'', on May 30, 2006, on [[Epic Records]]. In April 2008, Quietdrive left Epic Records and released an album titled ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, with the [[The Militia Group|Militia Group]]. In 2009, they left Militia Group and released an independent EP titled ''Close Your Eyes'' on their own record label, [[Sneaker 2 Bombs Records]]. Their third full-length album, ''[[Quietdrive (album)|Quietdrive]]'', was released on December 14, 2010, and a full-length album, ''Up or Down'', on April 24, 2012.  ''[[The Ghost of What You Used to Be]]'' was released on December 16, 2014.\n\n==History==\nThe original members of the band attended [[Sultana High School]] in Hesperia, California, and in ninth grade, Brandon Lanier started telling Droo Hastings that he was a great drummer  and that they should start a band with him and his friend Justin Bonhiver. Initially, the band was a [[Trio (music)|trio]] with Hastings as lead singer and bass guitar, Lanier playing drums, and Bonhiver on guitar.<ref name=\"sctimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080424/ENT/104240050/1005 |title=23rd Annual Mississippi Music Fest |publisher=St. Cloud Times |last= Hammer |first= Adam |date= 2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The band posted an audition for a lead singer on [[MP3.com]]. [[Kevin Truckenmiller]] entered the band after submitting his solo work, including an early incarnation of the song \"I Go Both Ways\", which was named after their friend, Jennings Lane. Matt Kirby began attending [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] with Truckenmiller.<ref name=\"emopunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |title=In person Interview |date=2006-05-30 |last=Jones |first=Liz |publisher=Emotional Punk |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065636/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}</ref> The group eventually joined together and formed in 2002 under the name \"Sneaker 2 Bombs,\" a hard rock band which reflected the evolving Minneapolis local music scene.<ref name=\"emopunk\"/>\n\nQuietdrive initially built a following at [[The Garage (Burnsville, Minnesota)|The Garage]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=Kevin (ed.) \n |url=http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |title=Best of the City Pages 2006 \n |date=2006-04-25 \n |publisher=City Pages \n |accessdate=2008-05-27 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515034110/http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |archivedate=May 15, 2006 \n}}</ref>{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2008}} The band pursued music venues in Minneapolis but found better connection with younger crowds and stayed between suburban and city clubs. As Quietdrive, the band recorded demo songs with Eric Trelstad.  These songs were heard by Will.I.Am from Black Eyed Peas during a visit to Minneapolis recording studio IPR.  Will arranged for the band to retain attorney Peter Lewitt and to showcase in Los Angeles but executives from Interscope passed on signing the band.  Afterwards, Truckenmiller began strongly to consider reorganizing the band with inclusion of Matt Kirby.  By April 2004, Kirby was officially made a band member and Sneaker2bombs began live performances in local bars including The Lodge.   Truckenmiller and Kirby also performed as an acoustic duo at the graduation night for Holy Angels Academy High School in June 2004.\n\nThe band put Sneaker2bombs recordings on music industry mp3 sites and Chris Foitle, an intern at Epic Records in Santa Monica, began contacting Bonhiver and Truckenmiller.  In July 2004, Epic arranged to see the band perform in Minneapolis with the assistance of Greg Sheldon.  Pete Giberga, a Vice President of A&R at Epic's Santa Monica's office, flew in and decided to sign the band.  Giberga was familiar with Sui Generis, a young emo act from Apple Valley who Giberga unsuccessfully pursued for Epic in 2003.  In early August 2004, Giberga contacted attorney Lewitt and offered a deal memo binding Quietdrive to Epic.  Truckenmiller consented.   Over the next four months, the band sought advice from industry veterans including Danny Nozell, and emerged with the decision to dismiss Lewitt, hire Sui Generis attorney Jeff Biederman, and negotiate a long form contract with Epic.  During this time, Atlantic Records also expressed interest in meeting with the band but that interest was held in check by Epic's deal memo and Epic's executive intimations that it would pursue legal action if it lost the band to another label.\n\nIn November 2004, the band flew to New York and met with Epic department heads, including head of A&R Ben Goldman, label chief Steve Barnett, head of marketing Lee Stimmel, and radio-promo heads Joel Klaiman and [[Jacqueline Saturn]].  Following that visit, final terms were negotiated and a long form was signed.\n\n''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'' is Quietdrive's first [[long play|LP]], produced, engineered and mixed by Matt Kirkwold and James Harley of World Record Productions with additional mixing by [[Chris Lord-Alge]] and [[Mark Endert]], was released in May 2006. Its first single was \"Rise from the Ashes\" and was used on [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[NHL 07]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, the band released a cover version of the [[Cyndi Lauper]] song \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" to nationwide radio play. The song is also used for the [[WNBA]] \"Have You Seen Her?\" advertising campaign. The song became a minor hit on pop radio, reaching No.&nbsp;25 on the syndicated ''[[American Top 40]]'' countdown show. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 2006 feature film, ''[[John Tucker Must Die]]'', and in the trailer for the 2008 remake of the film ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]''.\n\nAfter the CD release into 2007, the band had a lengthy US tour and was the \"Artist of the Month\" on [[Xbox Live]] in January 2007. Quietdrive, with producers Kirkwold and Harley, released a new single titled \"Pretend\" on their  AbsolutePunk.net page in early 2007 for fans. Though the band garnered success with Epic Records, in April 2008 they cancelled their contract, partly citing the restricting management of the major music industry.<ref name=\"sctimes\"/>\n\nQuietdrive released their second full-length album ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, and supported this album with an extensive tour with announced dates in the US, UK and Japan.<ref name='Deliverance Tour'>{{cite web|url=http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/tour |title=Quietdrive Deliverance Tour |accessdate=2008-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913233455/http://quietdrivemusic.com/tour |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nQuietdrive released their EP \"Close Your Eyes\" independently on October 13, 2009. Their first single was \"Jessica\". Robby Starbuck produced the music video, which premiered on buzznet.com on December 15, 2009.  Shortly after the release of ''Close Your Eyes'', Matt Kirby decided to leave the band.  In the summer of 2010, bassist Droo Hastings also decided to leave Quietdrive while the band was touring in support of ''Close Your Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/quietdrive|title=Quietdrive - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatt Kirby left the band due his first child being born. He became the band's manager shortly after. Several guitarists filled in for him at live shows. including Ryan Irey and Jack Swagger (Machine 22).\n\nThe band released their [[Quietdrive (album)|self-titled]] third studio album on December 14, 2010.<ref>http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2010 Droo Hastings left the band to pursue his own music and he also was expecting his first child. The band didn't make an official announcement at first. They took him off the official members area on Facebook and fans speculated that he had left the band and the band confirmed soon after. Droo still remains good friends with all the members of Quietdrive and frequents their shows in the Twin Cities.\n\nThey were looking for a full-time guitarist and bassist to fill Kirby and Droo's positions in the band. Will Caesar auditioned sometime in mid-2010 and Brice Niehaus auditioned for bassist soon after that. They both played in Milwaukee in August 2010 for the first time with the whole band which Will has said was basically their final audition for the band. Soon after that they were both added as official members of Quietdrive on their official Facebook page.\n\nQuietdrive began a fundraising project on [[Kickstarter]], and on July 31, 2011, just two hours before their deadline, the band exceeded their goal of $15,000 to record the cover album \"Your Record Our Spin\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref>  The band began recording in October 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin/posts|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref> and intended the album to include 10 songs voted on by fans and one original song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102236/http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> In late December 2011, fans who donated $10 or more via Kickstarter began receiving their copy of the album; the final version only included the ten songs voted on by Kickstarter-donating fans, with an original eleventh track available later for digital download via a password distributed to those who had donated to the fundraising campaign.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Quietdrive released their single \"Until the End (Acoustic)\" on iTunes, with all proceeds going to the Dean Randazzo Cancer Foundation.  A  music video was released on YouTube that same day, featuring the Grand Nationals, Colin Kassekert and [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nOn April 24, 2012, Quietdrive released their fourth studio album titled ''Up or Down''. Originally it was going to be an eight-song EP that was to be released late 2011 or early 2012. The release was changed to late spring 2012 due to unforeseen circumstances. In the past, Truckenmiller was the primary songwriter but due to Caesar's writing experience in previous jobs him and Truckenmiller cowrote many of the songs on the album.\n\nOn October 10, 2012, Bonhiver announced he was leaving the band to pursue other interests<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151104181103506&set=a.144580528505.116347.6016878505&type=1|title=Quietdrive - Goodbyes are never easy.

It was originally planned to release it in mid-2014 but they delayed it to December to release it in the U.S. shortly before their annual holiday show.\n\nIn December 2014, Caesar quit as a full-time member of Quietdrive but still plays if no one else is available. In 2015 they did not have plans to release another record but still tour occasionally. The members of the band rotate depending on who is available, including previous members Justin Bonhiver, Droo Hastings, and Matt Kirby.\n\nOn April 23, 2019, Quietdrive announced that they were reuniting for their first public show in nearly 4 years, and promised \"a lot of surprises\" over the coming summer and fall.<ref>{{Cite

He attended Byng Road Council School, (now called [http://www.fouldsp.org/about-our-school/history Foulds School]), and then went to [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/achievements/national_and_international_honours_list|title=Queen Elizabeth's School - National and international honours list|website=www.qebarnet.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/peters_olympic_memories|title=Peter's Olympic memories|date=2015|website=Queen Elizabeth's School|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> \n<!--\n== Early interest in athletics ==\n[[File:193x - Peter Wells Athlete - DOB 1929.05.23.jpg|left|upright=0.65|thumb|Wells as a boy]]\nWells first remembers competing in athletics whilst at Byng Road Council School - participating  in inter-schools\u2019 sports at the Barnet Playing Fields at the bottom of Barnet Hill, in Hertfordshire. The only events at that time were sprints, and Wells was usually able to win his age group.\n\nIn September 1939 Wells went to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Grammar School for boys, in Barnet, and participated in the annual inter-house athletics, again initially, in short sprints. At some stage he switched to concentrating on high jump and hurdles, in which he represented his school at the County schools\u2019 meeting in 1944, and then the Public Schools\u2019 championships at the White City Stadium, in London. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s had won the team event at those championships in 1939 and there was therefore quite a tradition of athletics at the school. This was probably due mainly to the enthusiasm and coaching of \u201cKlue\u201d (K.L. Woodland), the German language teacher.\n\nHe gave up hurdles when the height increased from 3 foot to 3 foot 3 inches, which didn't suit his running style.\n\nEarly on Wells was aware that he possessed considerable natural spring and was always being tempted to jump and touch over-hanging branches, feeling he could stay up there at the peak of the leap. His father had high jumped at school, and his older brother John had also done so before switching to javelin. In the school library there were two scrapbooks of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and Wells spent many hours poring over these and, in particular, the high jumping of the American, Harold Osborn, who was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Western Roll technique.\n\nInitially Wells practiced the scissors technique.

The youngest of 3, he had a brother John, who was about 3 years older than him, and a sister Mary, who was born between John and Peter. His father, Cecil Edward Wells was a Chartered Accountant, and Company Secretary for an Anglo-Brazilian firm.\n\n'''Second World War'''\n\nWells was 10 when WWII broke out. Barnet received a lot of bombing damage - the German bombers couldn\u2019t get through all the defences around London from the east, so they\u2019d try and come in from the north, come right over Barnet and quite often had to drop their bombs off around Barnet. Queen Elizabeth's School was hit and despite Wells having visions of months and months off school, the school only lost half a day because the bomb only affected the refectory (dining hall) and the chemistry lab.\n\nA bomb also landed in the back yard of 39 Byng Road. The family were lying in the hall which was thought to be the safest place. \u00c1t first it was thought to be an unexploded bomb and the family were evacuated to the local church hall. In fact the bomb did explode, but fortunately the surface was very soft and it exploded deep in the ground and did no damage. If it had exploded on the surface the whole house would have gone.\n\nIn the early days of the bombing, the family would go to an underground shelter in the evening until the bombing stopped. After a while, the family decided to take the risk and stay in the house. Near the end of the war, when [[Doodlebug (flying bomb)|doodlebugs]] were so prominent, Wells' father purchased a [[Morrison shelter|Morrison Shelter]] which was put up in the dining room.\n\n'''Conscription'''\n\nWells was conscripted into the army for 2 years on turning 18 in 1947. He was fortunate to get a London posting - some conscriptees were sent to Korea and died in conflict.\n\n== Emigrating to New Zealand ==\n[[File:1955 02 Cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon of Wells from 1955]]\n[[File:Peter Wells Athlete 2012 05 30 0948 - Peter in blazer.jpg|right|thumb|Wells in 2012, wearing his 1956 British Olympic team blazer]]Wells first arrived in New Zealand as a 20 year old athlete representing England in the high jump at the 1950 [[1950 British Empire Games|British Empire Games]] in Auckland. The only thing Wells knew about the 'colonies' was that once a year his schools had [[Commonwealth Day|Empire Day]], where they were told a little bit about the Empire. There had been a suggestion during the war years that all school children be evacuated, and Wells had wanted to go to Australia because it was furthest away.\n\nWells had completed his 2 years compulsory service in the army, had plans to follow his father's career as an Accountant, had secured a job as an Articles Clerk with a firm of London Accountants, and was part way through his Articles at the time of selection.\n\nAt the time England was still had severe food rationing. One of the big impressions New Zealand made on Wells was the magnificent food readily available - beautiful meat, cream, milk, ice cream and jugs of fruit juice.\n\nAfter the Games, while waiting for the Tamaroa to arrive to take them back to England, the English team split and went on an athletics tour of New Zealand. The group Wells was with travelled by train from Auckland to Wellington stooping at Rotorua on the way where they were hosted and entertained by the local Maori. From Wellington, they caught the inter-island ferry to Lyttelton, the port town that services Christchurch. They competed in Invercargill, Dunedin, Timaru, Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington. In Christchurch, Wells and Ron Pavitt stayed with Tick Langford, who was the public relations officer looking after the team. When the rest of the team got on the Tamaroa to head back to England, Wells had already decided that he wanted to stay, and caught the ferry back to Lyttelton instead.\n\nThe Langfords met Wells at Lyttelton and offered him a  place to stay in Christchurch, and shortly after he got offered a clerical job with McKendrick Brothers, a sack and jute merchant. He sent a telegram to his parents asking for their permission to stay in New Zealand, and requested a release from his Articles of Association - both of which were duly received.\n\nAs well as the food, Wells was attracted to the kiwi way of life. He was very aware of the class consciousness back in England, the University/non-University divide, and the tremendous gap between the rich and the poor. He also didn't want to go back to environment he'd been in - an hour on the tube every morning to work, standing on the tube halfway home because it was so crowded.

He lived initially in [[Finchley]] before moving at the age of two to [[High Barnet]]. He attended Byng Road Council School, (now called [http://www.fouldsp.org/about-our-school/history Foulds School]), and then went to [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/achievements/national_and_international_honours_list|title=Queen Elizabeth's School - National and international honours list|website=www.qebarnet.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/peters_olympic_memories|title=Peter's Olympic memories|date=2015|website=Queen Elizabeth's School|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> \n<!--\n== Early interest in athletics ==\n[[File:193x - Peter Wells Athlete - DOB 1929.05.23.jpg|left|upright=0.65|thumb|Wells as a boy]]\nWells first remembers competing in athletics whilst at Byng Road Council School - participating  in inter-schools\u2019 sports at the Barnet Playing Fields at the bottom of Barnet Hill, in Hertfordshire. The only events at that time were sprints, and Wells was usually able to win his age group.\n\nIn September 1939 Wells went to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Grammar School for boys, in Barnet, and participated in the annual inter-house athletics, again initially, in short sprints. At some stage he switched to concentrating on high jump and hurdles, in which he represented his school at the County schools\u2019 meeting in 1944, and then the Public Schools\u2019 championships at the White City Stadium, in London. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s had won the team event at those championships in 1939 and there was therefore quite a tradition of athletics at the school. This was probably due mainly to the enthusiasm and coaching of \u201cKlue\u201d (K.L. Woodland), the German language teacher.\n\nHe gave up hurdles when the height increased from 3 foot to 3 foot 3 inches, which didn't suit his running style.\n\nEarly on Wells was aware that he possessed considerable natural spring and was always being tempted to jump and touch over-hanging branches, feeling he could stay up there at the peak of the leap. His father had high jumped at school, and his older brother John had also done so before switching to javelin. In the school library there were two scrapbooks of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and Wells spent many hours poring over these and, in particular, the high jumping of the American, Harold Osborn, who was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Western Roll technique.\n\nInitially Wells practiced the scissors technique. It probably wasn\u2019t until 1946 or 1947 that he tried  the Western Roll technique, which he later found out to be completely wrong. He also tried the Eastern Cut-Off favoured by Japanese jumpers, but felt you needed to be a contortionist to succeed, although this was the style that Arthur Gold, his future coach, employed.-->\n\n==  English competition highlights ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Height\n!Place\n!Achievement\n!\n|-\n<!--\n|1946 - July 13\n|5 ft 9in\n|2nd\n|AAA Junior Championships<ref>{{Cite news|title=A.A.A Junior Championship|date=11 August 1947|work=Times [London, England]|issue=50836|page=2}}</ref>\n|Birmingham\n|-\n-->\n|1947 - April 19\n|6&nbsp;ft 0in\n|1st\n|First English schoolboy to clear 6&nbsp;ft 0in<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n|Motspur Park, London\n|-\n<!--\n|1947 - May 24\n|5 ft 10in\n|1st\n|Herts Schools Champion\n|Barnet, London\n|-\n|1947 - June 28\n|6 ft 1in\n|1st\n|Southern Championships\n|Motspur Park, London\n|-\n|1947 - July 2\n|6 ft 0\u00bcin\n|1st\n|AAA v UAU v Essex & Kent\n|Woodford Bridge\n|-\n|1947 - July 17\n|6 ft 3in\n|2nd\n|England v Wales v Scotland v Ireland\n|Fallowfield, Manchester\n|-\n|1947 - August 4\n|6 ft 1in\n|1st\n|Inter-Counties Championships\n|White City, London\n|-\n-->\n|1947 - August 9\n|6&nbsp;ft 0in\n|1st\n|AAA Junior Championships<ref>{{Cite news|title=A.A.A.

The youngest of 3, he had a brother John, who was about 3 years older than him, and a sister Mary, who was born between John and Peter. His father, Cecil Edward Wells was a Chartered Accountant, and Company Secretary for an Anglo-Brazilian firm.\n\n'''Second World War'''\n\nWells was 10 when WWII broke out. Barnet received a lot of bombing damage - the German bombers couldn\u2019t get through all the defences around London from the east, so they\u2019d try and come in from the north, come right over Barnet and quite often had to drop their bombs off around Barnet. Queen Elizabeth's School was hit and despite Wells having visions of months and months off school, the school only lost half a day because the bomb only affected the refectory (dining hall) and the chemistry lab.\n\nA bomb also landed in the back yard of 39 Byng Road. The family were lying in the hall which was thought to be the safest place. \u00c1t first it was thought to be an unexploded bomb and the family were evacuated to the local church hall. In fact the bomb did explode, but fortunately the surface was very soft and it exploded deep in the ground and did no damage. If it had exploded on the surface the whole house would have gone.\n\nIn the early days of the bombing, the family would go to an underground shelter in the evening until the bombing stopped. After a while, the family decided to take the risk and stay in the house. Near the end of the war, when [[Doodlebug (flying bomb)|doodlebugs]] were so prominent, Wells' father purchased a [[Morrison shelter|Morrison Shelter]] which was put up in the dining room.\n\n'''Conscription'''\n\nWells was conscripted into the army for 2 years on turning 18 in 1947. He was fortunate to get a London posting - some conscriptees were sent to Korea and died in conflict.\n\n== Emigrating to New Zealand ==\n[[File:1955 02 Cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon of Wells from 1955]]\n[[File:Peter Wells Athlete 2012 05 30 0948 - Peter in blazer.jpg|right|thumb|Wells in 2012, wearing his 1956 British Olympic team blazer]]Wells first arrived in New Zealand as a 20 year old athlete representing England in the high jump at the 1950 [[1950 British Empire Games|British Empire Games]] in Auckland. The only thing Wells knew about the 'colonies' was that once a year his schools had [[Commonwealth Day|Empire Day]], where they were told a little bit about the Empire. There had been a suggestion during the war years that all school children be evacuated, and Wells had wanted to go to Australia because it was furthest away.\n\nWells had completed his 2 years compulsory service in the army, had plans to follow his father's career as an Accountant, had secured a job as an Articles Clerk with a firm of London Accountants, and was part way through his Articles at the time of selection.\n\nAt the time England was still had severe food rationing. One of the big impressions New Zealand made on Wells was the magnificent food readily available - beautiful meat, cream, milk, ice cream and jugs of fruit juice.\n\nAfter the Games, while waiting for the Tamaroa to arrive to take them back to England, the English team split and went on an athletics tour of New Zealand. The group Wells was with travelled by train from Auckland to Wellington stooping at Rotorua on the way where they were hosted and entertained by the local Maori. From Wellington, they caught the inter-island ferry to Lyttelton, the port town that services Christchurch. They competed in Invercargill, Dunedin, Timaru, Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington. In Christchurch, Wells and Ron Pavitt stayed with Tick Langford, who was the public relations officer looking after the team. When the rest of the team got on the Tamaroa to head back to England, Wells had already decided that he wanted to stay, and caught the ferry back to Lyttelton instead.\n\nThe Langfords met Wells at Lyttelton and offered him a  place to stay in Christchurch, and shortly after he got offered a clerical job with McKendrick Brothers, a sack and jute merchant. He sent a telegram to his parents asking for their permission to stay in New Zealand, and requested a release from his Articles of Association - both of which were duly received.\n\nAs well as the food, Wells was attracted to the kiwi way of life. He was very aware of the class consciousness back in England, the University/non-University divide, and the tremendous gap between the rich and the poor. He also didn't want to go back to environment he'd been in - an hour on the tube every morning to work, standing on the tube halfway home because it was so crowded. He liked the open spaces New Zealand had to offer, and found Kiwi's to be 'free and easy'.  Wells realised that if he were to go back to the UK, it would take him years to save up enough money to get back to New Zealand.\n\nWells was not the only English athlete to stay behind. [[Harold Moody (athlete)|Dr Harold (HEA) Moody]] the shot putter, [[John Parlett]] (middle distance runner), [[Leslie Lewis (sprinter)|Leslie Charles Lewis]] (220 and 440 yards), and [[Duncan Clark (athlete)|Duncan (D.McD,D) Clark]] (Hammer Throw) also settled in New Zealand after the [[1950 British Empire Games|1950 Empire Games]].\n\nIn 1952 he married Shirley Muriel Grimwood from Harwarden, North Canterbury, and currently has 5 children, 10 grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren.\n-->== Jumping technique \u2013 the Western roll ==\nWells used the [[Western roll]] jumping technique.\n\nPeter Heidenstrom, athletics commentator and historian,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Athletes of the century : 100 years of New Zealand track and field|last=Heidenstrom|first=P.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.

[[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.</ref>\n\n''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' is a 756-page book divided in 45 chapters. Arieti begins his book stating that it is difficult to define schizophrenia.  He asks if schizophrenia is an [[Mental illness|illness]] and answers in the negative, since the disorder is not understood in classic [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchowian]] criterion of cellular [[pathology]].  Though those searching for a [[biological psychiatry|biological basis]] of schizophrenia far outnumber those undertaking [[Psychology|psychological]] approaches, Arieti supports the [[Trauma model|minority view]].  He believes schizophrenia is an unrealistic way to represent both the self and the world and praises psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] for stressing the importance of psychological factors in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n\n==The basis of schizophrenia==\n\nArieti examines the family history of people with schizophrenia, and references [[twin studies]] to support the notion that the potentiality for schizophrenia has a genetic basis, but maintains that this genetic potentiality is not enough to predispose someone to schizophrenia unless early life events also set up the vulnerability to breakdown later in life. A person who has the genetic predisposition, but was not subject to the life experiences necessary to develop this vulnerability will not become schizophrenic in later life.\n\nHe observed that in twin pairs, where one twin developed schizophrenia, the schizophrenic twin was less able to adapt to adverse life events compared to the healthier twin, and that following the schizophrenic breakdown of the other twin, in some cases the healthy twin was also vulnerable to developing schizophrenic symptoms, but these were quantitatively milder compared to the twin who first developed schizophrenia. Thus even with the better adapted twin, a level of vulnerability remained towards a breakdown.\n\n==Pre-psychotic personality types==\n\nArieti divides the pre-psychotic personality into two subgroups, which are the [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and the stormy types. The pre-psychotic schizoid type of personality's main adaptation involves the withdrawal typical of the schizoid personality disorder, wherein the person has limited to no social or emotional bonds, and mainly resorts to isolation and eschewing human relations to avoid potential retraumatization by others. They frequently substitute real human relations with a rich inner fantasy life. The pre-psychotic schizoid avoids conflict with the parents by passively submitting to their wishes, but he does so without any real zest or ambition, just going through the motions with minimal effort.\n\nThe stormy personality on the other hand tries strives to maintain social relations and emotional bonds, but the person in question is confused about their sense of self, as they mainly adapt to social situations by mirroring the perceived expectations of those around them and integrating it into a [[True self and false self|false self]] presented to the outside world. The stormy personality is always uncertain about their sense of self, compared to the pure schizoid personality, and this leaves them with a lack of [[ontological security]]. The stormy personality, owing to their adaptation, fails to develop true, deep relations with anyone due to their need to maintain a false persona that is always changed based on the perceived expectations of others. The stormy personality tries to please those around them as much as possible to win approval, especially the parents, even to the point of self-abandonment.\n\n==Family as a cause==\n\nArieti then describes the psychogenic factors that lead to the disorder.  The family environment and psychodynamics in the etiology of [[psychosis]] comes under scrutiny.  He describes the building of [[neurosis|neurotic]] and psychotic defense mechanisms; the emerging schizoid or stormy personality, and fully developed schizophrenia understood as an injury to the [[Self (psychology)|inner self]] following a series of adverse life events. Arieti believes that a state of extreme [[anxiety]] originating in early [[childhood]] produces vulnerability for the whole life of the individual, and that this anxiety can later be reactivated by adverse life events, where the individual's coping mechanisms fail to maintain a positive sense of self in face of these adversities.\n\nA characteristic of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is a prolonged childhood with a consequently extended dependency on adults.  This, according to Arieti, \"is the basis of the psychodynamics of schizophrenia\", a claim that also appears in later writers on [[child abuse]] such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and Colin Ross.  Arieti reviews the paper by [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]] about the  [[Theodore Lidz#.E2.80.9CSchizophrenogenic.E2.80.9D parents|\"schizophrenogenic\" mother]] and reaches the tentative conclusion that only 25 percent of the mothers of people with schizophrenia in his clinical experience fit that image.  However, he adds that only in a minority of schizophrenia cases \"the child is able to retain the good maternal image\". He clarifies that the internal maternal image is not based solely on the real mother, but is rather influenced by all relations the patient has throughout his life. The reason for this is that from infancy onward, the relationship with the mother lays the basis for all future relationships, and remains as an internal model for every relationship the patient has, and is shaped and altered by any future relations that influence the patient's view of the world, and of society at large. Arieti also mentions the work of [[Theodore Lidz]], another [[trauma model]] author of schizophrenia.  Like Lidz, Arieti emphasizes the weakness of the father of the patient with schizophrenia in the paternal role.  In Arieti's own words:\n\n:''In the first edition of this book I have described one family constellation [...] when a domineering, nagging and hostile mother, who gives the child no chance to assert himself, is married to a dependent, weak man, who is too weak to help the child [...].  In these families the weak parent [...] becomes antagonistic and [[Hostility|hostile]] toward the children because [...] he displaces his anger from the spouse to the children, as the spouse is too strong to be a suitable target.''\n\nThe roles can be reversed when the domineering spouse is the father. If the child cannot build positive relations with the mother or the father, then he will try to find a positive maternal image in others. A brother, a sister, or other relatives, a teacher, or a any other available individual the child can relate with. If the child manages to build up a relationship where he receives healthy nurturance, reassurement and empathy, which allows them to build up a positive self-image, then the vulnerability to a schizophrenic breakdown can be averted entirely. In the cases of schizophrenia, however, the breakdown is proof that this attempt failed time and time again for the individual.\n\nArieti is convinced that each schizophrenia case is representative of those human situations in which something went extremely wrong.  \"If we ignore it, we become deaf to a profound message that the patient may try to convey\". In the case of two brothers, Peter and Gabriel, of whom Gabriel later suffered a schizophrenic break, Arieti states that, as described by the brother, \"his adolescence was a crescendo of frustration, anxiety and injury to self-esteem\". Of the two brothers, Peter was the favorite of the father, who was an extremely narcissistic man who depended on Peter to maintain his self-esteem, whereas Gabriel was mostly ignored and neither parent ever really paid attention to him or gave him affection. Gabriel tried to turn to Peter for help, but he was rejected by Peter throughout his childhood. Gabriel went through his childhood without ever disagreeing with or asserting himself in front of his parents. He later developed schizophrenia in his teens, not long after returning to home from a private school. Gabriel expressed his anxiety regarding private schooling, and wished to return home so he could work on one of the family farms. However, even at his own work he was not allowed to make decisions for himself: Disregarding what Gabriel was taught in school, his mother practically told him how to plant every single vegetable on the farm, and how to tend to other needs. Gabriel, much like in his childhood, did not try to assert himself. As a result of this he tried to give up on his job, which incited further ire and hostility from the parents. Following these events, Gabriel soon developed a complete psychotic break, and was institutionalized.\n\n==Pre-psychotic panic==\n\nIn Part three of ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti describes how in spite of its efforts to stay in reality, the patient's defenses finally succumb when attacks on the self-image both from outside and within cause the anxiety to become too unbearable.  When the patient \"cannot change the unbearable situation of himself any longer, he has to change reality\".  Arieti examines the inner world of the person with schizophrenia, and the genesis of the schizophrenic regression.\n\nArieti maintains that even with the schizophrenic potentiality laid down in early childhood and by genetic predisposition, not all of these cases will develop psychosis, as new defense mechanisms are aquired throughout the life of the individual. For schizophrenics however, all such attempts eventually fail at staving off a complete break. The negative self-image that is dissociated from the conscious mind of the individual may be reactivated by any number of life events, such as entering a into a new relationship, the birth of a child, or a tragic accident, the death of a relative, especially the death of parents, moving out of home, stress at work, the loss of a job, or a promotion at work which destabilizes the individual's sense of competency at his own job, or a combination of several of these factors.\n\nThis anxiety triggers the pre-psychotic period, which preceedes the eventual psychotic break. These adverse life events bring the dissociated, negative self image from early childhood into consciousness, causing the person to view themselves as utterly defeated, unlovable, incompetent, worthless, etc. This type of anxiety cannot be tolerated by the individual for long, and as his defenses fail to defuse this anxiety, he will resort to increasingly inadequate coping mechanisms to maintain a positive self-image and reduce their anxiety.\n\nArieti describes the concept of paleological/teleological thinking, which is typical of small children and primitive peoples, with concrete examples of such thought in African tribal societies and in small children. At the beginning of the pre-psychotic panic, the individual's feelings of self-accusation and self-defeat are slowly transformed into feelings of vulnerability, fear and anguish. He feels cut off from the world itself because of his failure and worthlessness, and feels like he cannot join in with the rest of the world. He is overwhelmed by a vague perception of danger, a need to escape, and of confusion. ''He feels threatened from all sides, as if he were in a jungle. It is not a jungle where lions, tigers, snakes and spiders are to be found, but a jungle of concepts, where the threat is not to survival, but to the self image. The dangers are concept feelings, such as that of being unlovable, inadequate, unacceptable, inferior, awkward, clumsy, not belonging, peculiar, different, rejected, humiliated, guilty, unable to find his own way amongst the many different paths of life, disgraced, discriminated against, kept at a distance, suspected, and so on.''\n\nThese feelings of terror and persecution are then transformed into concretized concepts and projections. The schizophrenic, in an attempt to ward off unbearable anxiety, will resort to using paleological thinking to distort reality in such a way that reduces anxiety. Projection is used to displace self-accusations and attacks on the self-esteem to the outside world in the form of persecutors and persecutory forces.\n\nThe individual in the pre-psychotic stage may still recover if he manages to adopt adequate coping mechanisms, but if this fails, the pre-psychotic period will eventually be followed by a complete schizophrenic break when he experiences a total and complete defeat of his self-worth and self-esteem.\n\n==Schizophrenic thinking==\n\nArieti describes a distinct type of logic, separate from the aristotelian logic used by modern man in advanced societies, called \"paleological thinking\", or primary process thinking. In paleological thought, nature's events are attributed to the will of outside forces. \"If the greeks were afflicted by an epidemic, it was because Phoebus wanted to punish Agamemnon.\" In the world of paleological thinking, every happening that is relevant to the schizophrenic's complexes is interpreted as being willed by the projected persecutors of the individual. Primary process thinking, which is only encountered in dreams and in early childhood by modern man, is adapted by the schizophrenic to reduce destructive anxiety. Aristotelian logic is abandoned almost entirely, and primary process thinking gains more and more footing as the disease progresses from acute to chronic schizophrenia.\n\nIn deterministic or paleological/teleologic causality, if [[Nature]]'s happenings were not willed they simply would not occur. In paranoid [[projection (psychology)|projection]] the schizophrenic takes out from him/herself a disagreeable part of the self onto the world. In ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti illustrates all of the above theoretical constructions with concrete cases of his clinical experience as a psychiatrist. Anxiety-provoking material is projected onto the environment, because for the schizophrenic it is easier to be accused by others, than to accuse oneself. So for the person who feels disappointed with his life, and with himself, who sees himself as a failure, it is easier to imagine being persecuted by a group of agents who themselves are as deplorable and worthless, as he deep down sees himself, and want to bring him down to their level. It is less anxiety-provoking than to admit to himself that he sees himself as being worthless and deplorable, and it restores a sense of control, and also helps bolster self-esteem through gross over-appraisal of oneself as an individual who is persecuted because he is exceptional for one reason or another, such as being a savior, a prophet, etc.\n\nThus the patient who sees himself as a faker, a liar, or a homosexual will instead transform his inner persecutory world and project it onto the world, in the form of persecutors who accuse him of being a spy, a homosexual, a liar, or a faker, etc. It is no longer he who accuses himself of being worthless, rotten, but it is \"them\" accusing him. It is \"them\" who are after him, who want to ruin him and bring him down. The self-image and self-esteem are improved at the cost of gross distortion of reality and of the self-image.\n\nWhen a patient states he is [[Jesus]] he is compensating a feeling of extreme [[humiliation]] at home. The [[Paranoia|paranoid]] schizophrenic, Arieti explains, resorts to \"teleologic causality\" or [[animism]] to understand the world. He writes that whatever occurs to the patient is interpreted as willed by the split off, internal negative parental [[Dissociative identity disorder|images]] of the patient. With paranoid schizophrenics, the paleological thinking and distortion are limited only to the [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]] of the person, while in [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] patients there is a total and complete disintegration of aristotelian logic, and the entire personality is reduced to primary process thinking. Arieti observed that paranoid schizophrenia is more common in children who frequently felt rejected or neglected by their parents, and in brighter schizophrenics who were able to maintain a set of inner persecutory complexes that helped avoid destructive anxiety, whereas in hebephrenics this distortion failed to alleviate anxiety, causing further regression.\nIn the case of catatonic patients, it is more common that the patient was subjected to overbearing parenting and had little to no chance of asserting themselves. The catatonic patient internalizes the overbearing parental image, and chooses immobility to avoid provoking the ire of the internalized persecutory parental image. He brings up the example of a catatonic patient who, after [[Introjection|introjecting]] the mother's engulfing behavior, believed that by moving he could produce havoc. The patient's feelings, according to Arieti, became reminiscent of cosmic powers that may cause the destruction of the universe, so the patient chose immobility. For Arieti, the selectivity of certain motor actions is proof that [[catatonia]] is not a biological disease or illness, but rather a disorder of the will.\n\n==Self-image of the schizophrenic==\n\nAccording to Arieti, the pre-schizophrenic person in early childhood fails to build a healthy self-image, being unable to assert themselves in a healthy manner against their primary caregivers, as the dominant, [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] and hostile parent allows the child no chance to build up healthy limits and distinctions between themselves and the parent. The dominant parent sees the child less as an individual being, and more as an extension of themselves. The passive parent who projects their hostility from the dominant parent will also thwart such attempts. This is further complicated if other family members also take part in [[cycle of abuse|maintaining this atmosphere of hostility]]. Frequently the child who later becomes schizophrenic is either the dominant parent's favorite child, on whom the dominant parent depends for their self-esteem and self-gratification, or the family scapegoat who sits at the bottom of the family hierarchy, who is used as a lightning rod for discharging hostility within the family both by siblings and by the parents.\n\nAll children have an internal need to see their parents in a positive light, as the child depends on the parents for survival, even if the parental behavior is destructive to the child's self-esteem. In most cases the parental internal images can be corrected if the individual manages to build up healthy, emphatic relationships outside the family nucleus later in life, such as at school, at work, etc. However, for pre-schizophrenics, this does not occur, so the internal parental images remain unchallenged. So the child will idealize the hostile parents, but to do this, he must balance this out by maintaining a negative self-image. However, this self-image is too anxiety-provoking, so it remains dissociated deep down in the subconscious throughout the life of the individual, until adverse life events reactivate this hidden self-image, and with it, the destructive anxiety associated with it.\n\n==Psychotherapy of the schizophrenic==\n\nArieti himself preferred intensive psychotherapy of acute schizophrenic patients, with almost daily sessions every day of the week. He believed that in order to help reduce the suffering of the schizophrenic and to help them regain contact with the real world, the therapist needed to provide a trustworthy, intimate and stable relationship to the patient, a person who themselves never experienced such a relationship before. Unlike most psychiatrists, Arieti, like Sullivan and Bertram Karon, valued the content of the delusions as essential, albeit distorted manifestations of the original complexes by which the patient's destructive anxiety is fueled. He believed that ''meeting the schizophrenic in their own world'', but not conforming with or reassuring their delusions was essential to gaining the trust of the patient, and building a healthy connection.\n\nHe believed that by providing a stable and loving relationship, the therapist can help the patient build up a more positive self-image, as well as gain more adequate coping mechanisms for dealing with life events, and even building up more healthy relations with the family members. For Arieti, it was essential to help the patient develop a new, more healthy personality that was better adjusted to life, than to return to the pre-psychotic personality of the patient. As treatment progresses, the patient will more easily let go of their delusions and distortions of reality, allowing the original complexes that fueled their anxiety to be re-examined and processed. The goal of the therapist is to help guide the patient through the development of this new personality, by providing them with a positive, reassuring and empathic internal image. Arieti himself showcases his psychotherapeutic method with two cases, the cases of Geraldine and Mark in ''Interpretation of Schizophrenia''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arieti |first=Silvano |title=Interpretation of Schizophrenia |publisher=Aronson |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-258-97005-8}}</ref>\n\n==Other treatment methods==\n\nArieti was known for frequently sending hebephrenic patients for [[electroconvulsive therapy]] in order to restore them to a more functional level where they can be reached with psychotherapy, and he himself approved of the use of anti-psychotic medication to reduce symptomatology, however he himself preferred psychotherapy without any medication. He also explores and discusses other methods of treatment, such as [[insulin shock therapy]] and [[lobotomy|psychosurgery]], the latter of which he disapproves, maintaining that it is essentially an act of ''giving up on the patient and resorting to turning him into a lifelong cripple''.\n\n==Closing remarks==\n\nArieti maintains that in every case of schizophrenia that he studied serious [[dysfunctional family|family disturbance]] was found.  When the patient idealizes the parent the idealized image of the parent is maintained in the patient's mind at the expense of an unbearable [[self-image]]. Pre-psychotic panic is only triggered when the negative self-image is brought to the surface by adverse life events that damage the inner self of the pre-schizophrenic person, life events with which he is unable to cope with his existing defensive and coping mechanisms. The split-off negative image of the parents, and of others are transformed into a \"distressing other\", in the form of delusions of persecution, and voices heard by the patient.\nThe parent or parents alters enter the mind accusing the patient of \"bad child\" or other equivalent accusations in voices that the [[Hearing Voices Movement|adult patient hears]].\n\nSince the 1980s, and into the beginnings of 21st century, [[Biological psychiatry|biological psychiatric]] models of schizophrenia almost completely took over the [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] profession.  Current research into the disorder focuses on [[neurobiology]].  Psychological approaches to schizophrenia like Arieti's are a rarity in the profession, although this structurally created circumstance neglects the obvious connection between psychological phenomena and [[neurotransmitter]] levels, which can be changed through certain practices, like [[Yoga]], [[meditation]], [[hyperventilation]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[sleep deprivation]], among others. Arieti's views on schizophrenia are nowadays known as part of the [[trauma model of mental disorders]], an alternative to the current [[biopsychiatry|biopsychiatric model]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[R.D.

[[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.</ref>\n\n''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' is a 756-page book divided in 45 chapters. Arieti begins his book stating that it is difficult to define schizophrenia.  He asks if schizophrenia is an [[Mental illness|illness]] and answers in the negative, since the disorder is not understood in classic [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchowian]] criterion of cellular [[pathology]].  Though those searching for a [[biological psychiatry|biological basis]] of schizophrenia far outnumber those undertaking [[Psychology|psychological]] approaches, Arieti supports the [[Trauma model|minority view]].  He believes schizophrenia is an unrealistic way to represent both the self and the world and praises psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] for stressing the importance of psychological factors in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n\n==The basis of schizophrenia==\n\nArieti examines the family history of people with schizophrenia, and references [[twin studies]] to support the notion that the potentiality for schizophrenia has a genetic basis, but maintains that this genetic potentiality is not enough to predispose someone to schizophrenia unless early life events also set up the vulnerability to breakdown later in life. A person who has the genetic predisposition, but was not subject to the life experiences necessary to develop this vulnerability will not become schizophrenic in later life.\n\nHe observed that in twin pairs, where one twin developed schizophrenia, the schizophrenic twin was less able to adapt to adverse life events compared to the healthier twin, and that following the schizophrenic breakdown of the other twin, in some cases the healthy twin was also vulnerable to developing schizophrenic symptoms, but these were quantitatively milder compared to the twin who first developed schizophrenia. Thus even with the better adapted twin, a level of vulnerability remained towards a breakdown.\n\n==Pre-psychotic personality types==\n\nArieti divides the pre-psychotic personality into two subgroups, which are the [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and the stormy types. The pre-psychotic schizoid type of personality's main adaptation involves the withdrawal typical of the schizoid personality disorder, wherein the person has limited to no social or emotional bonds, and mainly resorts to isolation and eschewing human relations to avoid potential retraumatization by others. They frequently substitute real human relations with a rich inner fantasy life. The pre-psychotic schizoid avoids conflict with the parents by passively submitting to their wishes, but he does so without any real zest or ambition, just going through the motions with minimal effort.\n\nThe stormy personality on the other hand tries strives to maintain social relations and emotional bonds, but the person in question is confused about their sense of self, as they mainly adapt to social situations by mirroring the percieved expectations of those around them and integrating it into a [[True self and false self|false self]] presented to the outside world. The stormy personality is always uncertain about their sense of self, compared to the pure schizoid personality, and this leaves them with a lack of [[ontological security]]. The stormy personality, owing to their adaptation, fails to develop true, deep relations with anyone due to their need to maintain a false persona that is always changed based on the percieved expectations of others. The stormy personality tries to please those around them as much as possible to win approval, especially the parents, even to the point of self-abandonment.\n\n==Family as a cause==\n\nArieti then describes the psychogenic factors that lead to the disorder.  The family environment and psychodynamics in the etiology of [[psychosis]] comes under scrutiny.  He describes the building of [[neurosis|neurotic]] and psychotic defense mechanisms; the emerging schizoid or stormy personality, and fully developed schizophrenia understood as an injury to the [[Self (psychology)|inner self]] following a series of adverse life events. Arieti believes that a state of extreme [[anxiety]] originating in early [[childhood]] produces vulnerability for the whole life of the individual, and that this anxiety can later be reactivated by adverse life events, where the individual's coping mechanisms fail to maintain a positive sense of self in face of these adversities.\n\nA characteristic of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is a prolonged childhood with a consequently extended dependency on adults.  This, according to Arieti, \"is the basis of the psychodynamics of schizophrenia\", a claim that also appears in later writers on [[child abuse]] such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and Colin Ross.  Arieti reviews the paper by [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]] about the  [[Theodore Lidz#.E2.80.9CSchizophrenogenic.E2.80.9D parents|\"schizophrenogenic\" mother]] and reaches the tentative conclusion that only 25 percent of the mothers of people with schizophrenia in his clinical experience fit that image.  However, he adds that only in a minority of schizophrenia cases \"the child is able to retain the good maternal image\". He clarifies that the internal maternal image is not based solely on the real mother, but is rather influenced by all relations the patient has throughout his life. The reason for this is that from infancy onward, the relationship with the mother lays the basis for all future relationships, and remains as an internal model for every relationship the patient has, and is shaped and altered by any future relations that influence the patient's view of the world, and of society at large. Arieti also mentions the work of [[Theodore Lidz]], another [[trauma model]] author of schizophrenia.  Like Lidz, Arieti emphasizes the weakness of the father of the patient with schizophrenia in the paternal role.  In Arieti's own words:\n\n:''In the first edition of this book I have described one family constellation [...] when a domineering, nagging and hostile mother, who gives the child no chance to assert himself, is married to a dependent, weak man, who is too weak to help the child [...].  In these families the weak parent [...] becomes antagonistic and [[Hostility|hostile]] toward the children because [...] he displaces his anger from the spouse to the children, as the spouse is too strong to be a suitable target.''\n\nThe roles can be reversed when the domineering spouse is the father. If the child cannot build positive relations with the mother or the father, then he will try to find a positive maternal image in others. A brother, a sister, or other relatives, a teacher, or a any other available individual the child can relate with. If the child manages to build up a relationship where he receives healthy nurturance, reassurement and empathy, which allows them to build up a positive self-image, then the vulnerability to a schizophrenic breakdown can be averted entirely. In the cases of schizophrenia, however, the breakdown is proof that this attempt failed time and time again for the individual.\n\nArieti is convinced that each schizophrenia case is representative of those human situations in which something went extremely wrong.  \"If we ignore it, we become deaf to a profound message that the patient may try to convey\". In the case of two brothers, Peter and Gabriel, of whom Gabriel later suffered a schizophrenic break, Arieti states that, as described by the brother, \"his adolescence was a crescendo of frustration, anxiety and injury to self-esteem\". Of the two brothers, Peter was the favorite of the father, who was an extremely narcissistic man who depended on Peter to maintain his self-esteem, whereas Gabriel was mostly ignored and neither parent ever really paid attention to him or gave him affection. Gabriel tried to turn to Peter for help, but he was rejected by Peter throughout his childhood. Gabriel went through his childhood without ever disagreeing with or asserting himself in front of his parents. He later developed schizophrenia in his teens, not long after returning to home from a private school. Gabriel expressed his anxiety regarding private schooling, and wished to return home so he could work on one of the family farms. However, even at his own work he was not allowed to make decisions for himself: Disregarding what Gabriel was taught in school, his mother practically told him how to plant every single vegetable on the farm, and how to tend to other needs. Gabriel, much like in his childhood, did not try to assert himself. As a result of this he tried to give up on his job, which incited further ire and hostility from the parents. Following these events, Gabriel soon developed a complete psychotic break, and was institutionalized.\n\n==Pre-psychotic panic==\n\nIn Part three of ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti describes how in spite of its efforts to stay in reality, the patient's defenses finally succumb when attacks on the self-image both from outside and within cause the anxiety to become too unbearable.  When the patient \"cannot change the unbearable situation of himself any longer, he has to change reality\".  Arieti examines the inner world of the person with schizophrenia, and the genesis of the schizophrenic regression.\n\nArieti maintains that even with the schizophrenic potentiality laid down in early childhood and by genetic predisposition, not all of these cases will develop psychosis, as new defense mechanisms are aquired throughout the life of the individual. For schizophrenics however, all such attempts eventually fail at staving off a complete break. The negative self-image that is dissociated from the conscious mind of the individual may be reactivated by any number of life events, such as entering a into a new relationship, the birth of a child, or a tragic accident, the death of a relative, especially the death of parents, moving out of home, stress at work, the loss of a job, or a promotion at work which destabilizes the individual's sense of competency at his own job, or a combination of several of these factors.\n\nThis anxiety triggers the pre-psychotic period, which preceedes the eventual psychotic break. These adverse life events bring the dissociated, negative self image from early childhood into consciousness, causing the person to view themselves as utterly defeated, unlovable, incompetent, worthless, etc. This type of anxiety cannot be tolerated by the individual for long, and as his defenses fail to defuse this anxiety, he will resort to increasingly inadequate coping mechanisms to maintain a positive self-image and reduce their anxiety.\n\nArieti describes the concept of paleological/teleological thinking, which is typical of small children and primitive peoples, with concrete examples of such thought in African tribal societies and in small children. At the beginning of the pre-psychotic panic, the individual's feelings of self-accusation and self-defeat are slowly transformed into feelings of vulnerability, fear and anguish. He feels cut off from the world itself because of his failure and worthlessness, and feels like he cannot join in with the rest of the world. He is overwhelmed by a vague perception of danger, a need to escape, and of confusion. ''He feels threatened from all sides, as if he were in a jungle. It is not a jungle where lions, tigers, snakes and spiders are to be found, but a jungle of concepts, where the threat is not to survival, but to the self image. The dangers are concept feelings, such as that of being unlovable, inadequate, unacceptable, inferior, awkward, clumsy, not belonging, peculiar, different, rejected, humiliated, guilty, unable to find his own way amongst the many different paths of life, disgraced, discriminated against, kept at a distance, suspected, and so on.''\n\nThese feelings of terror and persecution are then transformed into concretized concepts and projections. The schizophrenic, in an attempt to ward off unbearable anxiety, will resort to using paleological thinking to distort reality in such a way that reduces anxiety. Projection is used to displace self-accusations and attacks on the self-esteem to the outside world in the form of persecutors and persecutory forces.\n\nThe individual in the pre-psychotic stage may still recover if he manages to adopt adequate coping mechanisms, but if this fails, the pre-psychotic period will eventually be followed by a complete schizophrenic break when he experiences a total and complete defeat of his self-worth and self-esteem.\n\n==Schizophrenic thinking==\n\nArieti describes a distinct type of logic, separate from the aristotelian logic used by modern man in advanced societies, called \"paleological thinking\", or primary process thinking. In paleological thought, nature's events are attributed to the will of outside forces. \"If the greeks were afflicted by an epidemic, it was because Phoebus wanted to punish Agamemnon.\" In the world of paleological thinking, every happening that is relevant to the schizophrenic's complexes is interpreted as being willed by the projected persecutors of the individual.

It is \"them\" who are after him, who want to ruin him and bring him down. The self-image and self-esteem are improved at the cost of gross distortion of reality and of the self-image.\n\nWhen a patient states he is [[Jesus]] he is compensating a feeling of extreme [[humiliation]] at home. The [[Paranoia|paranoid]] schizophrenic, Arieti explains, resorts to \"teleologic causality\" or [[animism]] to understand the world. He writes that whatever occurs to the patient is interpreted as willed by the split off, internal negative parental [[Dissociative identity disorder|images]] of the patient. With paranoid schizophrenics, the paleological thinking and distortion are limited only to the [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]] of the person, while in [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] patients there is a total and complete disintegration of aristotelian logic, and the entire personality is reduced to primary process thinking. Arieti observed that paranoid schizophrenia is more common in children who frequently felt rejected or neglected by their parents, and in brighter schizophrenics who were able to maintain a set of inner persecutory complexes that helped avoid destructive anxiety, whereas in hebephrenics this distortion failed to alleviate anxiety, causing further regression.\nIn the case of catatonic patients, it is more common that the patient was subjected to overbearing parenting and had little to no chance of asserting themselves. The catatonic patient internalizes the overbearing parental image, and chooses immobility to avoid provoking the ire of the internalized persecutory parental image. He brings up the example of a catatonic patient who, after [[Introjection|introjecting]] the mother's engulfing behavior, believed that by moving he could produce havoc. The patient's feelings, according to Arieti, became reminiscent of cosmic powers that may cause the destruction of the universe, so the patient chose immobility. For Arieti, the selectivity of certain motor actions is proof that [[catatonia]] is not a biological disease or illness, but rather a disorder of the will.\n\n==Self-image of the schizophrenic==\n\nAccording to Arieti, the pre-schizophrenic person in early childhood fails to build a healthy self-image, being unable to assert themselves in a healthy manner against their primary caregivers, as the dominant, [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] and hostile parent allows the child no chance to build up healthy limits and distinctions between themselves and the parent. The dominant parent sees the child less as an individual being, and more as an extension of themselves. The passive parent who projects their hostility from the dominant parent will also thwart such attempts. This is further complicated if other family members also take part in [[cycle of abuse|maintaining this atmosphere of hostility]]. Frequently the child who later becomes schizophrenic is either the dominant parent's favorite child, on whom the dominant parent depends for their self-esteem and self-gratification, or the family scapegoat who sits at the bottom of the family hierarchy, who is used as a lightning rod for discharging hostility within the family both by siblings and by the parents.\n\nAll children have an internal need to see their parents in a positive light, as the child depends on the parents for survival, even if the parental behavior is destructive to the child's self-esteem. In most cases the parental internal images can be corrected if the individual manages to build up healthy, emphatic relationships outside the family nucleus later in life, such as at school, at work, etc. However, for pre-schizophrenics, this does not occur, so the internal parental images remain unchallenged. So the child will idealize the hostile parents, but to do this, he must balance this out by maintaining a negative self-image. However, this self-image is too anxiety-provoking, so it remains dissociated deep down in the subconscious throughout the life of the individual, until adverse life events reactivate this hidden self-image, and with it, the destructive anxiety associated with it.\n\n==Psychotherapy of the schizophrenic==\n\nArieti himself preferred intensive psychotherapy of acute schizophrenic patients, with almost daily sessions every day of the week. He believed that in order to help reduce the suffering of the schizophrenic and to help them regain contact with the real world, the therapist needed to provide a trustworthy, intimate and stable relationship to the patient, a person who themselves never experienced such a relationship before. Unlike most psychiatrists, Arieti, like Sullivan and Bertram Karon, valued the content of the delusions as essential, albeit distorted manifestations of the original complexes by which the patient's destructive anxiety is fueled. He believed that ''meeting the schizophrenic in their own world'', but not conforming with or reassuring their delusions was essential to gaining the trust of the patient, and building a healthy connection.\n\nHe believed that by providing a stable and loving relationship, the therapist can help the patient build up a more positive self-image, as well as gain more adequate coping mechanisms for dealing with life events, and even building up more healthy relations with the family members. For Arieti, it was essential to help the patient develop a new, more healthy personality that was better adjusted to life, than to return to the pre-psychotic personality of the patient. As treatment progresses, the patient will more easily let go of their delusions and distortions of reality, allowing the original complexes that fueled their anxiety to be re-examined and processed. The goal of the therapist is to help guide the patient through the development of this new personality, by providing them with a positive, reassuring and empathic internal image. Arieti himself showcases his psychotherapeutic method with two cases, the cases of Geraldine and Mark in ''Interpretation of Schizophrenia''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arieti |first=Silvano |title=Interpretation of Schizophrenia |publisher=Aronson |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-258-97005-8}}</ref>\n\n==Other treatment methods==\n\nArieti was known for frequently sending hebephrenic patients for [[electroconvulsive therapy]] in order to restore them to a more functional level where they can be reached with psychotherapy, and he himself approved of the use of anti-psychotic medication to reduce symptomatology, however he himself preferred psychotherapy without any medication. He also explores and discusses other methods of treatment, such as [[insulin shock therapy]] and [[lobotomy|psychosurgery]], the latter of which he disapproves, maintaining that it is essentially an act of ''giving up on the patient and resorting to turning him into a lifelong cripple''.\n\n==Closing remarks==\n\nArieti maintains that in every case of schizophrenia that he studied serious [[dysfunctional family|family disturbance]] was found.  When the patient idealizes the parent the idealized image of the parent is maintained in the patient's mind at the expense of an unbearable [[self-image]]. Pre-psychotic panic is only triggered when the negative self-image is brought to the surface by adverse life events that damage the inner self of the pre-schizophrenic person, life events with which he is unable to cope with his existing defensive and coping mechanisms. The split-off negative image of the parents, and of others are transformed into a \"distressing other\", in the form of delusions of persecution, and voices heard by the patient.\nThe parent or parents alters enter the mind accusing the patient of \"bad child\" or other equivalent accusations in voices that the [[Hearing Voices Movement|adult patient hears]].\n\nSince the 1980s, and into the beginnings of 21st century, [[Biological psychiatry|biological psychiatric]] models of schizophrenia almost completely took over the [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] profession.  Current research into the disorder focuses on [[neurobiology]].  Psychological approaches to schizophrenia like Arieti's are a rarity in the profession, although this structurally created circumstance neglects the obvious connection between psychological phenomena and [[neurotransmitter]] levels, which can be changed through certain practices, like [[Yoga]], [[meditation]], [[hyperventilation]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[sleep deprivation]], among others. Arieti's views on schizophrenia are nowadays known as part of the [[trauma model of mental disorders]], an alternative to the current [[biopsychiatry|biopsychiatric model]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[R.D.

H. Munro''', was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes [[macabre]] stories satirize [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars as a master of the [[short story]], and often compared to [[O. Henry]] and [[Dorothy Parker]]. Influenced by [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], he himself influenced [[A. A. Milne]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nBesides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), he wrote a full-length play, ''[[The Watched Pot]]'', in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'' (the only book published under his own name); a short novel, ''The Unbearable Bassington''; the [[Serial (literature)|episodic]] ''[[The Westminster Alice]]'' (a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] parody of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''); and ''[[When William Came]]'', subtitled ''A Story of London Under the [[Hohenzollern]]s'', a fantasy about a [[invasion literature|future German invasion]] and occupation of Britain.\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early life ===\nHector Hugh Munro was born in [[Akyab]], [[British Burma]], which was then still part of [[British India]], and was governed from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], under the authority of the [[Viceroy of India]].  Saki was the son of Charles Augustus Munro, an Inspector General for the [[Indian Imperial Police]], and his wife, Mary Frances Mercer (1843\u20131872), the daughter of Rear Admiral Samuel Mercer. Her nephew Cecil William Mercer later became a well-known novelist, under the name of [[Dornford Yates]].\n\nIn 1872, on a home visit to England, Mary Munro was charged by a cow, and the shock caused her to miscarry. She never recovered and soon died.<ref>[http://www.ajlangguth.com/_saki__a_life_of_hector_hugh_munro__with_six_short_stories_never_before_collecte_11053.htm  \"Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro, with six short stories never before collected\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017060140/http://www.ajlangguth.com/_saki__a_life_of_hector_hugh_munro__with_six_short_stories_never_before_collecte_11053.htm |date=17 October 2013 }} (Hamish Hamilton, London, 1981), extract at AJLangguth.com</ref>\n\nAfter his wife's death Charles Munro sent his children, including two-year-old Hector, home to England. The children were sent to Broadgate Villa, in [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] village near [[Barnstaple]], North Devon, to be raised by their grandmother and paternal maiden aunts Charlotte and Augusta in a strict and puritanical household. It is said that his aunts were most likely models for some of his characters, notably the aunt in 'The Lumber Room'  and the guardian in  'Sredni Vashtar': Munro's sister Ethel said that the aunt in \"The Lumber Room\" was an almost perfect portrait of Aunt Augusta. Munro and his siblings led slightly insular lives during their early years and were educated by governesses. At the age of 12 the young Hector Munro was educated at Pencarwick School in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and then as a boarder at [[Bedford School]].\n\nIn 1887, after his retirement, his father returned from Burma and embarked upon a series of European travels with Hector and his siblings.\n\nHector followed his father in 1893 into the Indian Imperial Police and was posted to [[Burma]], but successive bouts of fever caused his return home after only fifteen months.\n\n===Writing career===\n\nIn 1896, he decided to move to London to make a living as a writer.\n\nMunro started his writing career as a journalist for newspapers such as the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'', the ''[[Daily Express]]'', the ''[[Morning Post]]'', and magazines such as the ''[[Bystander (magazine)|Bystander]]'' and ''Outlook''. His first book ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'', a historical study modeled upon [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved to be something of a false start.\n\nWhile writing ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'', he made his first foray into short story writing and published a piece called 'Dogged' in ''St Paul's'' in February 1899. He then moved into the world of political satire in 1900 with a collaboration with [[Francis Carruthers Gould]] entitled \"Alice in Westminster\". Gould produced the sketches, and Munro wrote the text accompanying them, using the pen-name \"Saki\" for the first time. The series lampooned political figures of the day ('Alice in Downing Street' begins with the memorable line, '\"Have you ever seen an Ineptitude?\"' - referring to a zoomorphised [[Arthur Balfour]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Munro |first=Hector H. (\"Saki\") |title=The Westminster Alice |year=1902 |location=London}}</ref>), and was published in the Liberal ''Westminster Gazette.''\n\nIn 1902 he moved to ''The Morning Post'', described as one of the 'organs of intransigence' by [[Stephen Koss]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Koss |first=Stephen |title=The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain, Volume Two: The Twentieth Century |year=1984 |location=London |page=80}}</ref> to work as a foreign correspondent, first in the Balkans, and then in Russia, where he was witness to the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 revolution in St Petersburg]]. He then went on to Paris, before returning to London in 1908, where 'the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him.'<ref>{{Cite book |last=Munro |first=H. H. (\"Saki\") |title=The Toys of Peace |last2=Reynolds |first2=Rothay |year=1919 |location=London |pages=xiv |chapter=A Memoir of H. H. Munro}}</ref> In the intervening period ''Reginald'' had been published in 1904, the stories having first appeared in the ''Westminster Gazette'', and all this time he was writing sketches for the ''Morning Post'', the ''Bystander,'' and the ''Westminster Gazette''. He kept a place in Mortimer Street, wrote, played bridge at the Cocoa Tree Club, and lived simply. ''Reginald in Russia'' appeared in 1910, and ''The Chronicles of Clovis'' was published in 1911, and ''Beasts and Super-Beasts'' in 1914, along with many other short stories that appeared in newspapers not published in collections in his lifetime.\n\nHe also produced two novels, ''The Unbearable Bassington'' (1912) and ''When William Came'' (1913).\n\n===Death===\nAt the start of the [[First World War]] Munro was 43 and officially over-age to enlist, but he refused a commission and joined the [[King Edward's Horse|2nd King Edward's Horse]] as an ordinary trooper. He later transferred to the 22nd Battalion of the [[Royal Fusiliers]], in which he rose to the rank of [[lance sergeant]]. More than once he returned to the battlefield when officially still too sick or injured. In November 1916 he was sheltering in a shell crater near [[Beaumont-Hamel]], France, during the [[Battle of the Ancre]], when he was killed by a German [[sniper]]. According to several sources, his [[last words]] were \"Put that bloody cigarette out!\"<ref>\"The Square Egg\", p. 102</ref>\n\nMunro has no known grave. He is commemorated on Pier and Face 8C 9A and 16A of the [[Thiepval Memorial]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1546551/MUNRO,%20HECTOR%20HUGH |title=CWGC - Casualty Details |last=Reading Room Manchester |website=cwgc.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 [[English Heritage]] marked Munro's flat at 97 Mortimer Street, in [[Fitzrovia]] with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/munro-hector-hugh-1870-1916-a.k.a.-saki |title=MUNRO, HECTOR HUGH (1870-1916) a.k.a. Saki |publisher=English Heritage |access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter his death his sister Ethel [[Book burning|destroyed]] most of his papers and wrote her own account of their childhood, which appeared at the beginning of ''The Square Egg and Other Sketches'' (1924). [[Rothay Reynolds]], a close friend, wrote a relatively lengthy memoir in ''The Toys of Peace'' (1919), but aside from this, the only other biographies of Munro are ''Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro'' (1982) by [[A. J. Langguth]], and ''The Unbearable Saki'' (2007) by Sandie Byrne. All later biographies have had to draw heavily upon Ethel's account of her brother's life.\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{see also|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}\nMunro was [[homosexuality|homosexual]] at a time when in Britain sexual activity between men was a crime. The [[Cleveland Street scandal]] (1889), followed by [[Oscar Wilde#Trial, imprisonment, and transfer to Reading Gaol|the downfall of Oscar Wilde]] (1895), meant \"that side of [Munro's] life had to be secret\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35149|title=Munro, Hector Hugh [Saki] (1870\u20131916)|last=Hibberd|first=Dominic|authorlink=Dominic Hibberd|year=2004|accessdate=9 May 2015|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35149}}</ref>\n\n== Pen-name ==\nThe pen name \"Saki\" is most commonly assumed to be a reference to the cupbearer in the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayyam]].''

Ulrich's family legally owns the land, and so considers Georg an interloper when he hunts in the forest. But Georg, believing that the forest rightfully belongs to his family, hunts there often and believes that Ulrich is the real interloper for trying to stop him. One winter night, Ulrich catches Georg hunting in the forest. Neither man can shoot the other without warning, as they would soil their family's honour, so they hesitate to acknowledge one another. In an \"act of God\", a tree branch suddenly falls on each of them, trapping them both under a log. Gradually they realize the futility of their quarrel, become friends and end the feud. They then call out for their men's assistance and, after a brief period, Ulrich makes out nine or ten figures approaching over a hill. The story ends with Ulrich's realization that the approaching figures on the hill are actually hungry wolves. The wolves, it seems, are the true owners of the forest, while both humans are interlopers.\n\n===\"Gabriel-Ernest\"===\n\"Gabriel-Ernest\" starts with a warning: \"There is a wild beast in your woods \u2026\" Gabriel, a naked boy sunbathing by the river, is \"adopted\" by well-meaning Townspeople.  Lovely and charming, but also rather vague and distant, he seems bemused by his \"benefactors.\"  Asked how he managed by himself in the woods, he replies that he hunts \"on four legs,\" which they take to mean that he has a dog. The climax comes when a small child disappears while walking home from Sunday school. A pursuit ensues, but Gabriel and the child disappear near a river. The only items found are Gabriel's clothes, and the two are never seen again.  The story includes many of the author's favorite themes:  good intentions gone awry, the banality of polite society, the attraction of the sinister, and the allure of the wild and the forbidden. There is also a recognition of basic decency, upheld when the story's protagonist 'flatly refuses' to subscribe to a Gabriel-Ernst memorial, for his supposedly gallant attempt to save a drowning child, and drowning himself, as well. He realises that Gabriel-Ernst was actually a [[werewolf]], who had eaten the child, then run off.\n\n===\"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\"===\nAt a railway station an arrogant and overbearing woman, Mrs Quabarl, mistakes the mischievous Lady Carlotta, who has been inadvertently left behind by a train, for the [[governess]], Miss Hope, whom she has been expecting, Miss Hope having erred about the date of her arrival. Lady Carlotta decides not to correct the mistake, acknowledges herself as Miss Hope, a proponent of \"the Schartz-Metterklume method\" of making children understand history by acting it out themselves, and chooses the [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] (exemplified by a washerwoman's two girls) as the first lesson. After creating chaos for two days, she departs, explaining that her delayed luggage will include a [[leopard]] cub.\n\n===\"The Toys of Peace\"===\nPreferring not to give her young sons toy soldiers or guns, and having taken away their toy depicting the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912-13)|Siege of Adrianople]], Eleanor instructs her brother Harvey to give them innovative \"peace toys\" as an Easter present. When the packages are opened young Bertie shouts \"It's a fort!\" and is disappointed when his uncle replies \"It's a municipal dustbin.\" The boys are initially baffled as to how to obtain any enjoyment from models of a school of art and a public library, or from little figures of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and Sir [[John Herschel]]. Youthful inventiveness finds a way, however, as the boys combine their history lessons on Louis XIV with a lurid and violent play-story about the invasion of Britain and the storming of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]]. The end of the story has Harvey reporting failure to Eleanor, explaining \"We have begun too late.\", not realising he was doomed to failure whenever he had begun.\n\n===\"The Storyteller\"===\nAn aunt is travelling by train with her two nieces and a nephew. The children are inquisitive and mischievous. A bachelor is also travelling in the same compartment. The aunt starts telling a moralistic story, but is unable to satisfy the children's curiosity. The bachelor butts in and tells a story in which a \"good\" person ends up being devoured by a wolf, to the children's delight. The bachelor is amused by the thought that in the future the children will embarrass their guardian by begging to be told \"an improper story.\"\n\n===\"The Open Window\"===\nFramton Nuttel, a nervous man, has come to stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of introduction to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know when she was staying there a few years previously. Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon, and Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to distract her by talking about his health. Then, to his horror, Mrs Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and runs away. Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the story, saying of the niece, \"Romance at short notice was her speciality.\"\n\n===\"The Unrest-Cure\"===\nSaki's recurring hero Clovis Sangrail, a clever, mischievous young man, overhears the complacent middle-aged Huddle complaining of his own addiction to routine and aversion to change. Huddle's friend makes the wry suggestion that he needs an \"unrest-cure\" (the opposite of a [[rest cure]]), to be performed, if possible, in the home. Clovis takes it upon himself to \"help\" the man and his sister by involving them in an invented outrage that will be a \"blot on the twentieth century\".\n[[File:Hector Hugh Munro.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===\"Esm\u00e9\"===\nA baroness tells Clovis a story about a hyena that she and her friend Constance encountered while out fox hunting. Later, the hyena follows them, stopping briefly to eat a gypsy child. Shortly after this, the hyena is killed by a motorcar. The baroness immediately claims the corpse as her beloved dog Esm\u00e9, and the guilty owner of the car gets his chauffeur to bury the animal and later sends her a diamond brooch to make up for her loss.<ref>Saki, [http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Esm.shtml Esme], at eastoftheweb.com, accessed 2 July 2017</ref>\n\n===\"Sredni Vashtar\"===\n{{main|Sredni Vashtar}}\nA sickly child named Conradin is raised by his aunt and guardian, Mrs De Ropp, who \"would never... have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him 'for his good' was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome\". Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his pole-cat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that \"Sredni Vashtar\" will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her.  The entire household is shocked and alarmed; Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.\n\n===\"Tobermory\"===\nAt a country-house party, one guest, Cornelius Appin, announces to the others that he has perfected a procedure for teaching animals human speech. He demonstrates this on his host's cat, Tobermory. Soon it is clear that animals are permitted to view and listen to many private things on the assumption that they will remain silent, such as the host Sir Wilfred's commentary on one guest's intelligence and the hope that she will buy his car, or the implied sexual activities of some of the other guests. The guests are angered, especially when Tobermory runs away to pursue a rival cat, but plans to poison him fail when Tobermory is instead killed by the rival cat. \"An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] and would have to be indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement.\" Appin is killed shortly afterwards when attempting to teach an elephant in a zoo in [[Dresden]] to speak German.\nHis fellow house party guest, Clovis Sangrail (Saki's recurring hero), remarks callously that if he was teaching \"the poor beast\" irregular German verbs, he deserved no pity.\n\n===\"The Bull\"===\nTom Yorkfield, a farmer, receives a visit from his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold a painting of a different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.\n\n===\"The East Wing\"===\nThis is a \"rediscovered\" short story that was previously cited as a play.<ref>Perhaps because of its subtitle: \"A Tragedy in the Manner of the Discursive Dramatists\". It was included only in later printings (1946 onwards) of ''The Complete Short Stories of Saki'' (John Lane The Bodley Head Limited)</ref> A house party is beset by a fire in the middle of the night in the east wing of the house. Begged by their hostess to save \"my poor darling Eva \u2013 Eva of the golden hair,\" Lucien demurs, on the grounds that he has never even met her. It is only on discovering that Eva is not a flesh-and-blood daughter but Mrs Gramplain's painting of the daughter she wished that she had had, and which she has faithfully updated with the passing years, that Lucien declares a willingness to forfeit his life to rescue her, since \"death in this case is more beautiful,\" a sentiment endorsed by the Major. As the two men disappear into the blaze, Mrs Gramplain recollects that she \"sent Eva to Exeter to be cleaned\". The two men have lost their lives for nothing.\n\n==Publications==\n\n* 1899 \"Dogged\" (short story, appeared as written by H. H.

H. Munro''', was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes [[macabre]] stories satirize [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars as a master of the [[short story]], and often compared to [[O. Henry]] and [[Dorothy Parker]]. Influenced by [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], he himself influenced [[A. A. Milne]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nBesides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), he wrote a full-length play, ''[[The Watched Pot]]'', in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'' (the only book published under his own name); a short novel, ''The Unbearable Bassington''; the [[Serial (literature)|episodic]] ''[[The Westminster Alice]]'' (a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] parody of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''); and ''[[When William Came]]'', subtitled ''A Story of London Under the [[Hohenzollern]]s'', a fantasy about a [[invasion literature|future German invasion]] and occupation of Britain.\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early life ===\nHector Hugh Munro was born in [[Akyab]], [[British Burma]], which was then still part of [[British India]], and was governed from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], under the authority of the [[Viceroy of India]].  Saki was the son of Charles Augustus Munro, an Inspector General for the [[Indian Imperial Police]], and his wife, Mary Frances Mercer (1843\u20131872), the daughter of Rear Admiral Samuel Mercer. Her nephew Cecil William Mercer later became a well-known novelist, under the name of [[Dornford Yates]].\n\nIn 1872, on a home visit to England, Mary Munro was charged by a cow, and the shock caused her to miscarry. She never recovered and soon died.<ref>[http://www.ajlangguth.com/_saki__a_life_of_hector_hugh_munro__with_six_short_stories_never_before_collecte_11053.htm  \"Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro, with six short stories never before collected\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017060140/http://www.ajlangguth.com/_saki__a_life_of_hector_hugh_munro__with_six_short_stories_never_before_collecte_11053.htm |date=17 October 2013 }} (Hamish Hamilton, London, 1981), extract at AJLangguth.com</ref>\n\nAfter his wife's death Charles Munro sent his children, including two-year-old Hector, home to England. The children were sent to Broadgate Villa, in [[Pilton, Devon|Pilton]] village near [[Barnstaple]], North Devon, to be raised by their grandmother and paternal maiden aunts Charlotte and Augusta in a strict and puritanical household. It is said that his aunts were most likely models for some of his characters, notably the aunt in 'The Lumber Room'  and the guardian in  'Sredni Vashtar': Munro's sister Ethel said that the aunt in \"The Lumber Room\" was an almost perfect portrait of Aunt Augusta. Munro and his siblings led slightly insular lives during their early years and were educated by governesses. At the age of 12 the young Hector Munro was educated at Pencarwick School in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and then as a boarder at [[Bedford School]].\n\nIn 1887, after his retirement, his father returned from Burma and embarked upon a series of European travels with Hector and his siblings.\n\nHector followed his father in 1893 into the Indian Imperial Police and was posted to [[Burma]], but successive bouts of fever caused his return home after only fifteen months.\n\n===Writing career===\n\nIn 1896, he decided to move to London to make a living as a writer.\n\nMunro started his writing career as a journalist for newspapers such as the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'', the ''[[Daily Express]]'', the ''[[Morning Post]]'', and magazines such as the ''[[Bystander (magazine)|Bystander]]'' and ''Outlook''. His first book ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'', a historical study modeled upon [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved to be something of a false start.\n\nWhile writing ''The Rise of the Russian Empire'', he made his first foray into short story writing and published a piece called 'Dogged' in ''St Paul's'' in February 1899. He then moved into the world of political satire in 1900 with a collaboration with [[Francis Carruthers Gould]] entitled \"Alice in Westminster\". Gould produced the sketches, and Munro wrote the text accompanying them, using the pen-name \"Saki\" for the first time. The series lampooned political figures of the day ('Alice in Downing Street' begins with the memorable line, '\"Have you ever seen an Ineptitude?\"' - referring to a zoomorphised [[Arthur Balfour]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Munro |first=Hector H. (\"Saki\") |title=The Westminster Alice |year=1902 |location=London}}</ref>), and was published in the Liberal ''Westminster Gazette.''\n\nIn 1902 he moved to ''The Morning Post'', described as one of the 'organs of intransigence' by [[Stephen Koss]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Koss |first=Stephen |title=The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain, Volume Two: The Twentieth Century |year=1984 |location=London |page=80}}</ref> to work as a foreign correspondent, first in the Balkans, and then in Russia, where he was witness to the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 revolution in St Petersburg]]. He then went on to Paris, before returning to London in 1908, where 'the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him.'<ref>{{Cite book |last=Munro |first=H. H.

Munro}}</ref> In the intervening period ''Reginald'' had been published in 1904, the stories having first appeared in the ''Westminster Gazette'', and all this time he was writing sketches for the ''Morning Post'', the ''Bystander,'' and the ''Westminster Gazette''. He kept a place in Mortimer Street, wrote, played bridge at the Cocoa Tree Club, and lived simply. ''Reginald in Russia'' appeared in 1910, and ''The Chronicles of Clovis'' was published in 1911, and ''Beasts and Super-Beasts'' in 1914, along with many other short stories that appeared in newspapers not published in collections in his lifetime.\n\nHe also produced two novels, ''The Unbearable Bassington'' (1912) and ''When William Came'' (1913).\n\n===Death===\nAt the start of the [[First World War]] Munro was 43 and officially over-age to enlist, but he refused a commission and joined the [[King Edward's Horse|2nd King Edward's Horse]] as an ordinary trooper. He later transferred to the 22nd Battalion of the [[Royal Fusiliers]], in which he rose to the rank of [[lance sergeant]]. More than once he returned to the battlefield when officially still too sick or injured. In November 1916 he was sheltering in a shell crater near [[Beaumont-Hamel]], France, during the [[Battle of the Ancre]], when he was killed by a German [[sniper]]. According to several sources, his [[last words]] were \"Put that bloody cigarette out!\"<ref>\"The Square Egg\", p. 102</ref>\n\nMunro has no known grave. He is commemorated on Pier and Face 8C 9A and 16A of the [[Thiepval Memorial]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1546551/MUNRO,%20HECTOR%20HUGH |title=CWGC - Casualty Details |last=Reading Room Manchester |website=cwgc.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 [[English Heritage]] marked Munro's flat at 97 Mortimer Street, in [[Fitzrovia]] with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/munro-hector-hugh-1870-1916-a.k.a.-saki |title=MUNRO, HECTOR HUGH (1870-1916) a.k.a.

[[Rothay Reynolds]], a close friend, wrote a relatively lengthy memoir in ''The Toys of Peace'' (1919), but aside from this, the only other biographies of Munro are ''Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro'' (1982) by [[A. J. Langguth]], and ''The Unbearable Saki'' (2007) by Sandie Byrne. All later biographies have had to draw heavily upon Ethel's account of her brother's life.\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{see also|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}\nMunro was [[homosexuality|homosexual]] at a time when in Britain sexual activity between men was a crime. The [[Cleveland Street scandal]] (1889), followed by [[Oscar Wilde#Trial, imprisonment, and transfer to Reading Gaol|the downfall of Oscar Wilde]] (1895), meant \"that side of [Munro's] life had to be secret\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35149|title=Munro, Hector Hugh [Saki] (1870\u20131916)|last=Hibberd|first=Dominic|authorlink=Dominic Hibberd|year=2004|accessdate=9 May 2015|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35149}}</ref>\n\n== Pen-name ==\nThe pen name \"Saki\" is most commonly assumed to be a reference to the cupbearer in the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayyam]].''

Ulrich's family legally owns the land, and so considers Georg an interloper when he hunts in the forest. But Georg, believing that the forest rightfully belongs to his family, hunts there often and believes that Ulrich is the real interloper for trying to stop him. One winter night, Ulrich catches Georg hunting in the forest. Neither man can shoot the other without warning, as they would soil their family's honour, so they hesitate to acknowledge one another. In an \"act of God\", a tree branch suddenly falls on each of them, trapping them both under a log. Gradually they realize the futility of their quarrel, become friends and end the feud. They then call out for their men's assistance and, after a brief period, Ulrich makes out nine or ten figures approaching over a hill. The story ends with Ulrich's realization that the approaching figures on the hill are actually hungry wolves. The wolves, it seems, are the true owners of the forest, while both humans are interlopers.\n\n===\"Gabriel-Ernest\"===\n\"Gabriel-Ernest\" starts with a warning: \"There is a wild beast in your woods \u2026\" Gabriel, a naked boy sunbathing by the river, is \"adopted\" by well-meaning Townspeople.  Lovely and charming, but also rather vague and distant, he seems bemused by his \"benefactors.\"  Asked how he managed by himself in the woods, he replies that he hunts \"on four legs,\" which they take to mean that he has a dog. The climax comes when a small child disappears while walking home from Sunday school. A pursuit ensues, but Gabriel and the child disappear near a river. The only items found are Gabriel's clothes, and the two are never seen again.  The story includes many of the author's favorite themes:  good intentions gone awry, the banality of polite society, the attraction of the sinister, and the allure of the wild and the forbidden. There is also a recognition of basic decency, upheld when the story's protagonist 'flatly refuses' to subscribe to a Gabriel-Ernst memorial, for his supposedly gallant attempt to save a drowning child, and drowning himself, as well. He realises that Gabriel-Ernst was actually a [[werewolf]], who had eaten the child, then run off.\n\n===\"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\"===\nAt a railway station an arrogant and overbearing woman, Mrs Quabarl, mistakes the mischievous Lady Carlotta, who has been inadvertently left behind by a train, for the [[governess]], Miss Hope, whom she has been expecting, Miss Hope having erred about the date of her arrival. Lady Carlotta decides not to correct the mistake, acknowledges herself as Miss Hope, a proponent of \"the Schartz-Metterklume method\" of making children understand history by acting it out themselves, and chooses the [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] (exemplified by a washerwoman's two girls) as the first lesson. After creating chaos for two days, she departs, explaining that her delayed luggage will include a [[leopard]] cub.\n\n===\"The Toys of Peace\"===\nPreferring not to give her young sons toy soldiers or guns, and having taken away their toy depicting the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912-13)|Siege of Adrianople]], Eleanor instructs her brother Harvey to give them innovative \"peace toys\" as an Easter present. When the packages are opened young Bertie shouts \"It's a fort!\" and is disappointed when his uncle replies \"It's a municipal dustbin.\" The boys are initially baffled as to how to obtain any enjoyment from models of a school of art and a public library, or from little figures of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Felicia Hemans]] and Sir [[John Herschel]]. Youthful inventiveness finds a way, however, as the boys combine their history lessons on Louis XIV with a lurid and violent play-story about the invasion of Britain and the storming of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]]. The end of the story has Harvey reporting failure to Eleanor, explaining \"We have begun too late.\", not realising he was doomed to failure whenever he had begun.\n\n===\"The Storyteller\"===\nAn aunt is travelling by train with her two nieces and a nephew. The children are inquisitive and mischievous. A bachelor is also travelling in the same compartment. The aunt starts telling a moralistic story, but is unable to satisfy the children's curiosity. The bachelor butts in and tells a story in which a \"good\" person ends up being devoured by a wolf, to the children's delight. The bachelor is amused by the thought that in the future the children will embarrass their guardian by begging to be told \"an improper story.\"\n\n===\"The Open Window\"===\nFramton Nuttel, a nervous man, has come to stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of introduction to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know when she was staying there a few years previously. Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon, and Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to distract her by talking about his health. Then, to his horror, Mrs Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and runs away. Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the story, saying of the niece, \"Romance at short notice was her speciality.\"\n\n===\"The Unrest-Cure\"===\nSaki's recurring hero Clovis Sangrail, a clever, mischievous young man, overhears the complacent middle-aged Huddle complaining of his own addiction to routine and aversion to change. Huddle's friend makes the wry suggestion that he needs an \"unrest-cure\" (the opposite of a [[rest cure]]), to be performed, if possible, in the home. Clovis takes it upon himself to \"help\" the man and his sister by involving them in an invented outrage that will be a \"blot on the twentieth century\".\n[[File:Hector Hugh Munro.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===\"Esm\u00e9\"===\nA baroness tells Clovis a story about a hyena that she and her friend Constance encountered while out fox hunting. Later, the hyena follows them, stopping briefly to eat a gypsy child. Shortly after this, the hyena is killed by a motorcar. The baroness immediately claims the corpse as her beloved dog Esm\u00e9, and the guilty owner of the car gets his chauffeur to bury the animal and later sends her a diamond brooch to make up for her loss.<ref>Saki, [http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Esm.shtml Esme], at eastoftheweb.com, accessed 2 July 2017</ref>\n\n===\"Sredni Vashtar\"===\n{{main|Sredni Vashtar}}\nA sickly child named Conradin is raised by his aunt and guardian, Mrs De Ropp, who \"would never... have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him 'for his good' was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome\". Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his pole-cat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that \"Sredni Vashtar\" will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her.  The entire household is shocked and alarmed; Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.\n\n===\"Tobermory\"===\nAt a country-house party, one guest, Cornelius Appin, announces to the others that he has perfected a procedure for teaching animals human speech. He demonstrates this on his host's cat, Tobermory. Soon it is clear that animals are permitted to view and listen to many private things on the assumption that they will remain silent, such as the host Sir Wilfred's commentary on one guest's intelligence and the hope that she will buy his car, or the implied sexual activities of some of the other guests. The guests are angered, especially when Tobermory runs away to pursue a rival cat, but plans to poison him fail when Tobermory is instead killed by the rival cat. \"An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] and would have to be indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement.\" Appin is killed shortly afterwards when attempting to teach an elephant in a zoo in [[Dresden]] to speak German.\nHis fellow house party guest, Clovis Sangrail (Saki's recurring hero), remarks callously that if he was teaching \"the poor beast\" irregular German verbs, he deserved no pity.\n\n===\"The Bull\"===\nTom Yorkfield, a farmer, receives a visit from his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold a painting of a different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.\n\n===\"The East Wing\"===\nThis is a \"rediscovered\" short story that was previously cited as a play.<ref>Perhaps because of its subtitle: \"A Tragedy in the Manner of the Discursive Dramatists\". It was included only in later printings (1946 onwards) of ''The Complete Short Stories of Saki'' (John Lane The Bodley Head Limited)</ref> A house party is beset by a fire in the middle of the night in the east wing of the house. Begged by their hostess to save \"my poor darling Eva \u2013 Eva of the golden hair,\" Lucien demurs, on the grounds that he has never even met her. It is only on discovering that Eva is not a flesh-and-blood daughter but Mrs Gramplain's painting of the daughter she wished that she had had, and which she has faithfully updated with the passing years, that Lucien declares a willingness to forfeit his life to rescue her, since \"death in this case is more beautiful,\" a sentiment endorsed by the Major. As the two men disappear into the blaze, Mrs Gramplain recollects that she \"sent Eva to Exeter to be cleaned\". The two men have lost their lives for nothing.\n\n==Publications==\n\n* 1899 \"Dogged\" (short story, appeared as written by H. H.
