She was cast as Jan Brady on ''The Brady Bunch'' in 1969, and portrayed the role until the series' end in 1974. After, Plumb continued to work in television, portraying a teenage prostitute in the [[NBC]] television film ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976), and as Elizabeth March in the 1978 miniseries ''[[Little Women (1978 film)|Little Women]]''.\n\nPlumb continued to reprise her role as Jan Brady on numerous reunion series and films, including ''[[The Brady Brides]]'' (1981) and ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988).

The following year, she appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'' and ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. (She was also cast as \"Bonnie Braids\" in a [[Dick Tracy#Live-action television pilot|TV pilot]] version of the comic strip [[Dick Tracy]], but does not actually appear in the program itself, only in the opening credits.) In 1968, she appeared on ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' and ''[[Family Affair]]''; in the latter, she played a terminally ill girl on the episode \"Christmas Came A Little Early\". In 1969, she appeared on an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Plumb appeared as middle sister Jan Brady in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. Her featured storylines included Jan's embarrassment over not having a boyfriend, concerns about her future appearance, being a middle child, and her insecurity over wearing glasses. Several episodes centered on Jan's jealousy of older sister [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]], resulting in the famous \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" line that has arguably become the quintessential quote of the series. Plumb also supplied the voice of Jan in the ABC Saturday morning cartoon ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' from 1972 to 1973. After ''The Brady Bunch'' was canceled in 1974, it went on to even greater success in syndicated reruns. The sitcom has never left the television airwaves and eventually spawned numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], reunion specials, feature films, and parodies.\n\nSeveral episodes of the sitcom featured the Brady kids singing and as a result, Plumb and the rest of the younger cast recorded several albums. Plumb would also provide a monologue for the [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Pat Williams]] Orchestra's 1974 recording of \"California Love Story\". The single was co-produced by Plumb's recording executive father, Neely Plumb.\n\n===1975\u20132000: Other projects and ''Brady Bunch'' reunions===\n[[File:Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway Eve Plumb 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Plumb as the title character in ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'', 1976]]\nAfter ''The Brady Bunch'' ended, Plumb's first notable role was that of a teenage prostitute in the NBC television movie ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976).

The following year, she appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'' and ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. (She was also cast as \"Bonnie Braids\" in a [[Dick Tracy#Live-action television pilot|TV pilot]] version of the comic strip [[Dick Tracy]], but does not actually appear in the program itself, only in the opening credits.) In 1968, she appeared on ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' and ''[[Family Affair]]''; in the latter, she played a terminally ill girl on the episode \"Christmas Came A Little Early\". In 1969, she appeared on an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Plumb appeared as middle sister Jan Brady in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. Her featured storylines included Jan's embarrassment over not having a boyfriend, concerns about her future appearance, being a middle child, and her insecurity over wearing glasses. Several episodes centered on Jan's jealousy of older sister [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]], resulting in the famous \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" line that has arguably become the quintessential quote of the series. Plumb also supplied the voice of Jan in the ABC Saturday morning cartoon ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' from 1972 to 1973. After ''The Brady Bunch'' was canceled in 1974, it went on to even greater success in syndicated reruns. The sitcom has never left the television airwaves and eventually spawned numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], reunion specials, feature films, and parodies.\n\nSeveral episodes of the sitcom featured the Brady kids singing and as a result, Plumb and the rest of the younger cast recorded several albums. Plumb would also provide a monologue for the [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Pat Williams]] Orchestra's 1974 recording of \"California Love Story\". The single was co-produced by Plumb's recording executive father, Neely Plumb.\n\n===1975\u20132000: Other projects and ''Brady Bunch'' reunions===\n[[File:Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway Eve Plumb 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Plumb as the title character in ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'', 1976]]\nAfter ''The Brady Bunch'' ended, Plumb's first notable role was that of a teenage prostitute in the NBC television movie ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976).

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976)<ref name=\"MR\"/> and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).<ref name=\"MR\"/> It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation,<ref name=\"MR\"/> Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]]. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a [[PhD]]<ref name=mayphd/> degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from [[interplanetary dust]] and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.

As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[IRAS]] satellite. After a [[Oral exam|viva voce]], the revised thesis (titled \"A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud\")<ref name=mayphd/> was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced.<ref name=buzzcocksphd>{{cite episode| series=Never Mind The Buzzcocks| station=BBC| seriesno=21| number=10| minutes=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525083058/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 May 2012 |title=BRIAN MAY \u2013 Official Biography |work=Brianmay.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =May| first =Brian| title =News| url =http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120720094841/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| url-status=dead| archive-date =20 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Queen star hands in science PhD\"/><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen star celebrates doctorate |work=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6961171.stm |accessdate=25 August 2007 | date=23 August 2007 }}</ref> He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s.

It has campuses in the [[Leeds city centre|city centre]] and [[Headingley]]. The university\u2019s origins can be traced to 1824, with the foundation of the Leeds [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]]. Leeds Polytechnic was formed in 1970, and was part of the Leeds [[Local Education Authority]] until it became an independent Higher Education Corporation on 1 April 1989. In 1992, the institution gained university status. The current name was adopted in September 2014.<ref name=\"name change\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-29310495|title=Leeds Beckett University drops 'Metropolitan' name|publisher=BBC|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe annual income of the institution for 2016&ndash;17 was \u00a3221.4&nbsp;million of which \u00a33.4&nbsp;million was from grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3217.1&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Leeds Beckett Financial Statement 16/17\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HolbornChurchLS6.jpg|thumb|right|Leeds Mechanics' Institute building, Woodhouse]]\n{{multiple image\n | width = 120\n | image1 = Leeds-poly.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = 1990s and 2000s Leeds Metropolitan University owl logo.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Logos used by Leeds Polytechnic in the 1980s and Leeds Metropolitan University in the 1990s and early 2000s\n}}\n\nThe university traces its roots to 1824 when the Leeds Mechanics Institute was founded. The institute later became the Leeds Institute of Science, Art and Literature and in 1927 was renamed Leeds College of Technology. In 1970, the college merged with Leeds College of Commerce (founded 1845), part of [[Leeds College of Art]] (f. 1846) and Yorkshire College of Education and Home Economics (f. 1874), forming '''Leeds Polytechnic'''. In 1976, James Graham College and the City of Leeds College of Education (f. 1907 as part of [[City of Leeds Training College]]) joined Leeds Polytechnic. In 1987, the Polytechnic became one of the founding members of the [[NCUK|Northern Consortium]].\n\nAfter the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992|Further and Higher Education Act]] came into effect in 1992, the Polytechnic became '''Leeds Metropolitan University''', with the right to award its own degrees. In 1998, the university merged with [[Harrogate College]], establishing the Harrogate campus until 2008 when the college left the university and merged with [[Hull College]]. In 2008 the university petitioned the [[Privy Council]] to be renamed \"Leeds Carnegie University\"; however, this was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leeds Met's name change put on hold as troubled university unveils its new head|first=John|last=Roberts|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Leeds-Met39s-name-change-put.5511877.jp|work=Yorkshire Post|publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> In 2009 a partnership with the [[University of North Florida]] was established to begin a student and faculty exchange programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/studyabroad/MU-International-List_of_International_Partners_2.pdf|publisher=Leeds Beckett University|title=International Partners|accessdate=12 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112115947/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/studyabroad/MU-International-List_of_International_Partners_2.pdf|archivedate=12 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university also has an agreement with [[Bradford College, England|Bradford College]] by which it validates degrees for the college.\n\n===Name change===\nIn 2013, it was announced that the Board of Governors had applied to the Privy Council to change the name to Leeds Beckett University,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23488414|title=Leeds Metropolitan aims to become Leeds Beckett University|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref> after one of the university's founding colleges, [[Beckett Park]], which in turn was named after [[Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe]].

These include: [[Old Broadcasting House]], the former home of the BBC in Leeds; Electric Press, a building on [[Millennium Square (Leeds)|Millennium Square]]; and Old School Board, the birthplace of school education in Leeds. The latest additions for the 2008/09-year were the Rose Bowl, the new home of the Leeds Business School, opposite the Civic Hall and designed to reflect the facade of the Civic Hall and the Broadcasting Place complex, including Broadcasting Tower, a new set of buildings which fits in with the red stone brick buildings famous in Leeds and which provides teaching space for the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology and the Faculty of Art, Architecture and Design, as well as student accommodation.  Three buildings on the site have been disposed of since becoming a university, the Brunswick building was sold and in 2008 demolished; it is now the site of the [[Leeds Arena]].  A further tower block has been sold and is now a [[Premier Inn]]. More recently, Cloth Hall Court has also been disposed of and sold to their neighbour, The University of Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4538/university_acquires_city_centre_venue|title=University acquires city centre venue|last=Martin [Comms|first=Oliver|website=www.leeds.ac.uk|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> The remaining largely 1960s buildings of the former polytechnic were reclad in the early 2010s.\n\nNew high-rise student accommodation has been built around the City Campus and includes [[Opal Tower (Leeds)|Opal Tower]] and the [[Sky Plaza]].

It has campuses in the [[Leeds city centre|city centre]] and [[Headingley]]. The university\u2019s origins can be traced to 1824, with the foundation of the Leeds [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]]. Leeds Polytechnic was formed in 1970, and was part of the Leeds [[Local Education Authority]] until it became an independent Higher Education Corporation on 1 April 1989. In 1992, the institution gained university status.

The institute later became the Leeds Institute of Science, Art and Literature and in 1927 was renamed Leeds College of Technology. In 1970, the college merged with Leeds College of Commerce (founded 1845), part of [[Leeds College of Art]] (f. 1846) and Yorkshire College of Education and Home Economics (f. 1874), forming '''Leeds Polytechnic'''. In 1976, James Graham College and the City of Leeds College of Education (f. 1907 as part of [[City of Leeds Training College]]) joined Leeds Polytechnic. In 1987, the Polytechnic became one of the founding members of the [[NCUK|Northern Consortium]].\n\nAfter the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992|Further and Higher Education Act]] came into effect in 1992, the Polytechnic became '''Leeds Metropolitan University''', with the right to award its own degrees. In 1998, the university merged with [[Harrogate College]], establishing the Harrogate campus until 2008 when the college left the university and merged with [[Hull College]]. In 2008 the university petitioned the [[Privy Council]] to be renamed \"Leeds Carnegie University\"; however, this was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leeds Met's name change put on hold as troubled university unveils its new head|first=John|last=Roberts|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Leeds-Met39s-name-change-put.5511877.jp|work=Yorkshire Post|publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> In 2009 a partnership with the [[University of North Florida]] was established to begin a student and faculty exchange programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/studyabroad/MU-International-List_of_International_Partners_2.pdf|publisher=Leeds Beckett University|title=International Partners|access-date=12 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112115947/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/studyabroad/MU-International-List_of_International_Partners_2.pdf|archive-date=12 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university also has an agreement with [[Bradford College, England|Bradford College]] by which it validates degrees for the college.\n\n===Name change===\nIn 2013, it was announced that the Board of Governors had applied to the Privy Council to change the name to Leeds Beckett University,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23488414|title=Leeds Metropolitan aims to become Leeds Beckett University|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref> after one of the university's founding colleges, [[Beckett Park]], which in turn was named after [[Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe]].

These include: [[Old Broadcasting House]], the former home of the BBC in Leeds; Electric Press, a building on [[Millennium Square (Leeds)|Millennium Square]]; and Old School Board, the birthplace of school education in Leeds. The latest additions for the 2008/09-year were the Rose Bowl, the new home of the Leeds Business School, opposite the Civic Hall and designed to reflect the facade of the Civic Hall and the Broadcasting Place complex, including Broadcasting Tower, a new set of buildings which fits in with the red stone brick buildings famous in Leeds and which provides teaching space for the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology and the Faculty of Art, Architecture and Design, as well as student accommodation.

He was the editor of ''[[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]]'' from 1908 until 1952.\n\n==Early life==\nHerbert Lawrence Stone was born in 1871 in [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] to William and Mary (Taylor) Stone.  His father [[William Stone (attorney)|William]] was a successful New York attorney, after serving for a short time as the Attorney General for South Carolina.  Herbert's paternal grandfather [[Thomas Treadwell Stone]] was a prominent New England minister and [[Transcendentalist]].  Herbert spent much of his childhood in New York, but spent many summers in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] learning to sail in Cape Cod bays. After being diagnosed with a lung condition that was expected to significantly shorten his life, Stone went to sea at the age of 17.  He made several voyages on the schooner ''Hattie Weston'' under the command of Captain Josiah Morton.  Stone subsequently went to work as assistant paymaster for the NY Central Railroad.  In 1898 Herbert married Redelia Gilchrist in Iowa City, IA, and had two sons, William and James.\n\n==Career with ''Yachting'' Magazine==\nOn January 1, 1907, publisher [[Oswald Garrison Villard]] released the first issue of ''[[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]]''.  A year later Villard appointed his \"schoolmate and lifelong friend\", 37-year-old Herbert Stone, as the magazine's second editor.<ref>Villard, Oswald Garrison, ''Fighting Years'', Harcourt, Brace and Company,1939.</ref>  Stone continued as the editor through a series of ownership changes, except for a brief two-year period during World War I when he went to war and left William Atkin in charge of ''Yachting''.<ref>''Yachting'', October 2007 - http://www.yachtingmagazine.com/2007/10/the-first-decades-photo-gallery?pnid=120701</ref>\n\nIn 1920 Herbert Stone, Albert Britt and William A. Miles purchased the magazine from Mr. Villard, and sold it to John Clarke Kennedy a few years later.  In 1938 Stone assembled the Yachting Publishing Company, and took on the role of president, publisher, and editor.  In the years that followed Herbert wrote many articles for the magazine, both under a variety of pen names as well as his own.

When the war ended Stone and a few friends bought some cargo schooners and formed Mercator Navigation Company, operating in coastal and foreign trade.  But that business soon closed as steam was replacing sail on the seas, and the operation of those schooners became economically impracticable.\n\n==Boating and Racing==\nIn 1909 Herbert was one of the organizers of a sailing race around [[Long Island, NY]], and won the Brooklyn Challenge Cup in ''Waialua'' the following year.  In 1922 Stone helped to organize and became one of the 33 charter members of the [[Cruising Club of America]], and served as its second commodore in 1923.<ref>Jones, Gregory O., ''American Sailboat'', MBI Publishing Company, St. Paul, MN, 2002.</ref> His influence helped steer that club to a preeminent position in the national and even world yachting picture.<ref name=Skipper />  Although primarily a sailor, Stone won a race around Long Island in 1916 in the power cruiser \"Cero\".<ref name=Skipper />\n\nIn the early 1920s Stone and a few others decided to revive Bermuda racing.

The film was chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the Top 10 Films of 2018. At the Independent Spirit Awards, the film received nominations for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead|Best Male Lead]] (Hawke), [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], while Schrader's screenplay was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award]], the first of his career.\n\n==Plot==\nReverend Ernst Toller is the pastor of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York, who is struggling through a crisis of faith. The film opens with him writing down his thoughts in a journal for a year, after which he intends to destroy it. He leads a 250-year-old [[Reformed Church in America|Dutch Reformed Church]] which was once a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]]. It faces dwindling attendance under Toller's leadership, which has taken the church away from its historical focus on [[Calvinist]] theology; it now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. As he tries to manage his own life issues, such as his [[alcoholism]], Toller seeks a deeper experience through reading Roman Catholic writers ([[G.K. Chesterton]] and [[Thomas Merton]]) and mystical books (''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]''). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life, the nearby evangelical [[megachurch]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] that owns First Reformed.\n\nToller, a former [[military chaplain]], is also struggling with the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the [[Iraq War]]; Toller had encouraged him to enlist. He meets Mary, who is seeking counseling for Michael, her [[Radical environmentalism|radical-environmentalist]] husband. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs: He explains that he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by [[climate change]].\n\nMary finds a [[Explosive belt|suicide vest]] belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it, promising to counsel Michael about it. Mary and Toller discuss going to the police, but Toller feels it would dramatically worsen Michael's state. Just before their next appointment, Michael sends Toller a text message asking to meet in a local park. Toller arrives to find Michael dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael's [[will and testament]], a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump, where his ashes are scattered. Meanwhile, plans are underway to celebrate the [[sestercentennial]] of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor, the governor, and Edward Balq, one of Abundant Life's key financial backers and the owner of a polluting factory. At a meeting in a diner, Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael's will and deems it as a political act, and the two argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as \"complicated\", but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]]. \n\nExperiencing physical pain, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor, who suspects stomach cancer and schedules tests. Toller has Michael's laptop computer, which he took after Michael's suicide to prevent the police from discovering Michael's radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael's concerns, including the materials which inspired him to make the explosive vest. One night, Mary visits Toller in the [[parsonage]] of the church, and he plays Michael's role in a nonsexual rite of physical intimacy that the couple used to perform.\n\nToller begs Mary not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony, he puts on the explosive vest, and arms it. When he sees Mary entering for the ceremony, he removes the vest and instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his [[alb]]. Toller pours a glass full of [[drain cleaner]] and is about to drink it when Mary interrupts him. The two embrace, kissing passionately before the film abruptly cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Pastor Ernst Toller, leader of a tiny historic church who is going through several personal crises\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Mary Mensana, a pregnant widow and parishioner at First Reformed\n* [[Cedric Kyles]] as Pastor Joel Jeffers, megachurch pastor at the evangelical Abundant Life church\n* [[Victoria Hill]] as Esther, a worker at Abundant Life who is in love with Toller\n* Philip Ettinger as Michael Mensana, a radical environmentalist and [[Anti-natalism|anti-natalist]] whose suicide emboldens Toller\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Edward Balq, local industrialist and financier of Abundant Life\n* Bill Hoag as John Elder, church organist at First Reformed  (Performed by William E.

The other two partners went bankrupt in 2002 and 2004. In 2006, when Mr Collier had finally made his payments (totalling exactly one third of the debt) Wrights served on him a statutory demand for the 'balance of the debt'.

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

The APU also powers electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft.<ref>{{Cite report|work=Hamilton and Sundstrand |title=Airbus A380 Fact sheet |url=http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |access-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302205101/http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Passenger provisions===\n{{main|Seat configurations of Airbus A380}}\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1721793.jpg|thumb|10 across [[economy class]] seating]]\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1385446.jpg|thumb|Emirates [[business class]]]]\n[[File:Etihad Airways aircraft interiors demo ITB 2017 (08).JPG|thumb|Etihad The Residence Apartment with bedroom, living room and an en-suite shower room\non Airbus A380-800]]\n\nThe A380-800's [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] has {{convert|550|m2|sqft|0}} of usable floor space,<ref>{{cite web |title= Airbus A380 Facts & Figures |date= June 2018 |publisher= Airbus |url= https://www.airbus.com/content/dam/corporate-topics/publications/backgrounders/Backgrounder-Airbus-Commercial-Aircraft-A380-Facts-and-Figures-EN.pdf }}</ref> 40% more than the next largest airliner, the [[Boeing 747-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeings-747-8-vs-a380-a-titanic-tussle-205137/|title=Boeing's 747-8 vs. A380: A titanic tussle|first=Max|last=Kingsley-Jones|work=Flight International|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of {{convert|1520|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to {{convert|12000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airbus A380 Brief|url=http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422021427/http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|archive-date=22 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"norris_wagner_book\"/>{{rp|129}} It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} extra headroom versus the 747\u2013400.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Aircraft \u2013 Airbus A380|url=http://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/airbus_a380.pl |accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"a380_figures\">{{cite web|title=Fascinating figures about the A380 |publisher=Airbus |url=http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |accessdate=1 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704190610/http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |archivedate=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Seating options range from 3-room {{convert|12|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|title=Cabin of Airbus A380|work=airbus|access-date=24 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231132208/http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|archivedate=31 December 2016}}</ref> A380 economy seats are up to {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide in a 10-abreast configuration,<ref>{{cite web|title=Onboard the Airbus A380|publisher=[[Fodors]]|url=http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020004918/http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archivedate=20 October 2007 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats {{convert|44.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|title=747-400 Cross Sections|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html|accessdate=19 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611225956/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html |archivedate= 11 June 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> On other aircraft, economy seats range from {{convert|41.5|to|52.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|title=A survey of the best airline economy seats|last=Verghese|first=Vijay|year=2011|publisher=Smarttravelasia.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520010120/http://smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|archivedate=20 May 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and one [[aft]], with both being wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

Like most it is formed of one eight-car 200m set that can be coupled with another to produce a 16-car 400m set. Like other Velaros they can operate at temperatures between -25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C.

The door windows are larger, square windows, as opposed to the airplane style oval windows on older [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] models.
