Night Shyamalan]] and executive produced by Shyamalan, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Sam Mercer]]. A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Blinding Edge Pictures]] and [[The Kennedy/Marshall Company]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Touchstone Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Touchstone Home Entertainment]] in home media format. Its story focuses on a former [[Episcopal priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|Episcopal priest]] named Graham Hess, played by [[Mel Gibson]], who discovers a series of [[crop circle]]s in his cornfield. Hess slowly discovers that the phenomenon is a result of [[extraterrestrial life]]. It also stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Rory Culkin]], and [[Abigail Breslin]]. ''Signs'' explores the themes of faith, kinship, and extraterrestrials.<ref name=\"Film\">[[M. Night Shyamalan|Shyamalan, M. Night]] (Director). (2002). ''Signs'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Touchstone Pictures]].</ref>\n\nFollowing its premiere in theatres nationwide on August 2, 2002, the film grossed $227,966,634 in domestic ticket receipts screening at 3,453 theatres during its widest release. It earned an additional $180,281,283 in business through international release, to top out at a combined $408,247,917 in gross revenue. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including those from the [[Online Film Critics Society]] and the [[8th Empire Awards|Empire Awards]]. The film also won an award from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. Considering its $72 million budget costs, the film was considered a strong financial success after its theatrical run, and was met with positive reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and story but others criticizing aspects of the script. The high-definition Blu-ray Disc edition of the film featuring the director's audio commentary, the making of the film, and deleted scenes was released in the United States on June 3, 2008. The original motion picture soundtrack, which was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], was released on the opening day by the [[Hollywood Records]] label.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer Episcopal priest Graham Hess ([[Mel Gibson]]) lives on a remote farm with his [[asthma]]tic preteen son Morgan ([[Rory Culkin]]) and younger daughter Bo ([[Abigail Breslin]]). Graham's younger brother Merrill ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a failed minor-league baseball player, has been living on the farm to help out since Graham's wife Colleen died in a traffic accident six months earlier, shown in a series of flashbacks. Graham has since lost his religious faith and abandoned the church.\n\nLarge [[crop circle]]s appear in the Hess' corn field that are initially attributed to vandals. Soon after, other crop circles, eventually determined to be navigational guides, appear globally, and lights from invisible objects hover over Mexico and other cities later on. One night, Graham and Merrill chase a tall dark figure that disappears into the field. Graham later glimpses another one among the corn stalks, and strange clicking noises are heard over Bo's old baby monitor. In Brazil, an alien is filmed during a child's birthday party.\n\nRay Reddy ([[Shyamalan|M. Night Shyamalan]]), the man responsible for Colleen's fatal accident, calls the Hess house but hangs up. Graham goes to investigate, finding Reddy sitting inside his car. Reddy expresses remorse for Colleen's death and Graham losing his faith. As he is about to drive to a lake, believing the aliens avoid water, Reddy warns Graham that a creature is locked inside his pantry. Graham investigates but leaves quickly when the trapped alien tries to attack him.\n\nAs a worldwide alien invasion begins, the Hesses barricade themselves inside their house. As several aliens break into the house, the family retreats to the basement. Morgan has an asthma attack but survives the night, despite being without his medication. The family emerge the next morning after radio reports say the aliens have abruptly abandoned Earth, stranding some aliens. The alien which had been trapped inside Ray Reddy's pantry enters the house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen's dying words, Graham tells Merrill to, \"swing away\", using his baseball bat. The alien sprays Morgan with a toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken son as Merrill bashes the creature, hitting it into glasses of water left by Bo, the liquid scalding its skin. Merrill continues hitting the creature, eventually killing it. Outside, Morgan revives after Graham administers his medication. Morgan's constricted lungs prevented him inhaling the alien's poisonous gas, an act Graham attributes to God's intervention.\n\nMonths later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal. In the final scene, Graham is seen as having returned to the church, his faith restored.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Father Graham Hess, a farmer and former [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-24-me-signs24-story.html|title='Signs' Offers Plenty to Think About|date=2002-08-24|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aLgprgU7x-sC&lpg=PA12&ots=SVukL-u2KS&dq=signs%202002%20movie%20mel%20gibson%20%22Episcopal%22&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q=signs%202002%20movie%20mel%20gibson%20%22Episcopal%22&f=false|title=The Blackwell Guide to Theology and Popular Culture|last=Cobb|first=Kelton|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-77770-1|language=en}}</ref> priest.

William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review that: <blockquote>With ''Signs'', composer James Newton Howard again joins director M. Night Shyamalan for their third collaboration following ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. From his opening \"Main Theme,\" Howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful.

Night Shyamalan]] and executive produced by Shyamalan, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Sam Mercer]]. A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Blinding Edge Pictures]] and [[The Kennedy/Marshall Company]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Touchstone Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Touchstone Home Entertainment]] in home media format. Its story focuses on a former [[Episcopal priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|Episcopal priest]] named Graham Hess, played by [[Mel Gibson]], who discovers a series of [[crop circle]]s in his cornfield. Hess slowly discovers that the phenomenon is a result of [[extraterrestrial life]]. It also stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Rory Culkin]], and [[Abigail Breslin]]. ''Signs'' explores the themes of faith, kinship, and extraterrestrials.<ref name=\"Film\">[[M. Night Shyamalan|Shyamalan, M. Night]] (Director). (2002). ''Signs'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Touchstone Pictures]].</ref>\n\nFollowing its premiere in theatres nationwide on August 2, 2002, the film grossed $227,966,634 in domestic ticket receipts screening at 3,453 theatres during its widest release. It earned an additional $180,281,283 in business through international release, to top out at a combined $408,247,917 in gross revenue. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including those from the [[Online Film Critics Society]] and the [[8th Empire Awards|Empire Awards]]. The film also won an award from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. Considering its $72 million budget costs, the film was considered a strong financial success after its theatrical run, and was met with positive reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and story but others criticizing aspects of the script. The high-definition Blu-ray Disc edition of the film featuring the director's audio commentary, the making of the film, and deleted scenes was released in the United States on June 3, 2008. The original motion picture soundtrack, which was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], was released on the opening day by the [[Hollywood Records]] label.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer Episcopal priest Graham Hess ([[Mel Gibson]]) lives on a remote farm with his [[asthma]]tic preteen son Morgan ([[Rory Culkin]]) and younger daughter Bo ([[Abigail Breslin]]). Graham's younger brother Merrill ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a failed minor-league baseball player, has been living on the farm to help out since Graham's wife Colleen died in a traffic accident six months earlier, shown in a series of flashbacks. Graham has since lost his religious faith and abandoned the church.\n\nLarge [[crop circle]]s appear in the Hess' corn field that are initially attributed to vandals. Soon after, other crop circles, eventually determined to be navigational guides, appear globally, and lights from invisible objects hover over Mexico and other cities later on. One night, Graham and Merrill chase a tall dark figure that disappears into the field. Graham later glimpses another one among the corn stalks, and strange clicking noises are heard over Bo's old baby monitor. In Brazil, an alien is filmed during a child's birthday party.\n\nRay Reddy ([[Shyamalan|M. Night Shyamalan]]), the man responsible for Colleen's fatal accident, calls the Hess house but hangs up. Graham goes to investigate, finding Reddy sitting inside his car. Reddy expresses remorse for Colleen's death and Graham losing his faith. As he is about to drive to a lake, believing the aliens avoid water, Reddy warns Graham that a creature is locked inside his pantry. Graham investigates but leaves quickly when the trapped alien tries to attack him.\n\nAs a worldwide alien invasion begins, the Hesses barricade themselves inside their house. As several aliens break into the house, the family retreats to the basement. Morgan has an asthma attack but survives the night, despite being without his medication. The family emerge the next morning after radio reports say the aliens have abruptly abandoned Earth, stranding some aliens. The alien which had been trapped inside Ray Reddy's pantry enters the house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen's dying words, Graham tells Merrill to, \"swing away\", using his baseball bat. The alien sprays Morgan with a toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken son as Merrill bashes the creature, hitting it into glasses of water left by Bo, the liquid scalding its skin. Merrill continues hitting the creature, eventually killing it. Outside, Morgan revives after Graham administers his medication. Morgan's constricted lungs prevented him inhaling the alien's poisonous gas, an act Graham attributes to God's intervention.\n\nMonths later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal. In the final scene, Graham is seen as having returned to the church, his faith restored.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Father Graham Hess, a farmer and former [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-24-me-signs24-story.html|title='Signs' Offers Plenty to Think About|date=2002-08-24|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aLgprgU7x-sC&lpg=PA12&ots=SVukL-u2KS&dq=signs%202002%20movie%20mel%20gibson%20%22Episcopal%22&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q=signs%202002%20movie%20mel%20gibson%20%22Episcopal%22&f=false|title=The Blackwell Guide to Theology and Popular Culture|last=Cobb|first=Kelton|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-77770-1|language=en}}</ref> priest.

William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review that: <blockquote>With ''Signs'', composer James Newton Howard again joins director M. Night Shyamalan for their third collaboration following ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. From his opening \"Main Theme,\" Howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful. He overloads his lower tones, employing eight basses, five percussionists, and even a tuba, but also uses a large string section for short, fast, repetitive figures meant to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. This is not particularly imaginative music, just good old Saturday afternoon scary movie fare, the only distinguishing characteristic about it -- consistent with Shyamalan's style -- that it is so relentless. There's just no let up; dread pervades every moment of the director's films, to the point of emotional exhaustion for some, and the score has to have the same uncompromising approach, which can make it a little hard to take when listened to all the way through.</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n<!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the \"accessdate\" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. -->\n''Signs'' has received positive reviews from film critics.

Other viruses range from 50 to 100 nanometers. In addition to being large physically, Pandoraviruses have a large [[genome]] made up of 2,500 genes, compared to only 10 genes on average in other viruses. For example, the [[Influenza A virus|Influenza A]] virus contains 7 genes and [[HIV]] contains only 9 genes. Gene content varies among species of Pandoravirus,&nbsp;with [[Pandoravirus salinus|''Pandoravirus salinus'',]] containing 2,500 genes and ''[[Pandoravirus dulcis]]'' containing about 1,500 genes. Pandoraviruses were originally mistaken for [[bacteria]], however, they are missing some of the distinct features of bacteria such as the ability to make their own proteins. The dissimilarity of the remaining genes to any cellular genes led researchers to speculate that this virus may represent a previously unknown branch of the&nbsp;[[Phylogenetic tree|tree of life]]. However, experts not involved in the study have called that suggestion premature because there is very little evidence supporting the idea.\n\n== Replication ==\nPandoraviruses have double stranded DNA. Like most giant viruses, Pandoraviruses have a [[viral life cycle]]. They lack the ability to make their own proteins, rely on the host cells for ATP (energy) and reproduction and also do not contain [[ribosome]]s or produce energy to divide. Under the microscope, scientists observed the virus enter the amoeba through fusion with membrane vacuoles, and integrate their DNA into the host cells. The host cell replicates the viral particles and eventually splits open releasing the viral particles. The process of replication cycle lasts 10\u201315 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virology.ws/2013/08/01/pandoravirus-bigger-and-unlike-anything-seen-before/|title=Pandoravirus, bigger and unlike anything seen before|website=www.virology.ws|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref> Viral replication and assembly happens simultaneously. In other words, viral DNA is replicated within the [[cytoplasm]] of the host cell and assembled into new viral particles followed by lysis of the host cell.\n\n== Prevalence in the environment ==\nPandoraviruses do not seem to be harmful to humans. They are mostly found in marine environments, infecting amoebae. One reason for their only relatively recent discovery is because they exist in environments that are not well studied.  Pandoraviruses, like other marine viruses, prey on [[plankton]], which are organisms that live in the water column and form the basis of the food chain for other marine species. More study and research needs to be done in order to confirm the prevalence of Pandoraviruses in different environments.

The story centers on a man named Train Heartnet who withdrew from an elite group of assassins called the Chronos Numbers to become a bounty hunter.\n\nThe series was adapted into a twenty-four episode [[anime]] television series by studio [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], which originally aired on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] (TBS) channel from October 2005 to March 2006. The manga was licensed for English-language publication in North America by [[Viz Media]] and in Australasia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. [[Funimation Entertainment]] licensed the anime for an English dub and North American broadcast on their own [[Funimation Channel]], with Madman releasing it in Australasia and [[MVM Films]] in the United Kingdom.</onlyinclude>\n\nIn Japan, the ''Black Cat'' manga sold over 12 million copies, while in North America several volumes have been featured in weekly top ten lists of best-selling manga. The anime has also been popular in both Japan and North America. Manga and anime critics had praise for ''Black Cat''{{'s}} action, differing views on the artwork and characters, and mainly negative comments for its plot which has been criticized for having typical elements of [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] (targeted at boys).\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Black Cat characters}}\nSet in a [[fictional universe]], [[Train Heartnet]], once an assassin for [[List of Black Cat characters#Chronos|Chronos]], an organization bent on world peace that rules one third of the world's economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed [[bounty hunter]]) traveling with his partner [[Sven Vollfied]]. They meet and team up with professional thief [[Rinslet Walker]] in order to break into an arms dealer's home and obtain some data, but encounter a human bio-weapon named [[Eve (Black Cat)|Eve]] that was created using [[nanotechnology]]. Sven and Train ultimately decide to free Eve from her owner and train her to be a Sweeper. Rinslet is kidnapped by [[Creed Diskenth]], a former Chronos assassin that killed Train's friend [[Saya Minatsuki]] for changing Train's outlook on life and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the [[Apostles of the Stars]] in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.\n\nThe Apostles of the Stars launch their first attack on the World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed in order to gain his help, though he resists, planning to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin [[Jenos Hazard]] is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert [[Dr. Tearju]], who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, [[Eathes]] was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide to put a stop to Creed.\n\nThey team up with a group called the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, organized by Chronos assassin [[Lin Shaolee]] in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. [[Sephiria Arks]] faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.\n\n==Production==\nSix months before ''Black Cat'' began, [[Kentaro Yabuki]]'s one-shot version titled ''Stray Cat'' was published.

It was originally serialized in publisher [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine from July 2000 to June 2004, with the chapters later collected into twenty ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' (bound volumes) by Shueisha. The story centers on a man named Train Heartnet who withdrew from an elite group of assassins called the Chronos Numbers to become a bounty hunter.\n\nThe series was adapted into a twenty-four episode [[anime]] television series by studio [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], which originally aired on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] (TBS) channel from October 2005 to March 2006. The manga was licensed for English-language publication in North America by [[Viz Media]] and in Australasia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. [[Funimation Entertainment]] licensed the anime for an English dub and North American broadcast on their own [[Funimation Channel]], with Madman releasing it in Australasia and [[MVM Films]] in the United Kingdom.</onlyinclude>\n\nIn Japan, the ''Black Cat'' manga sold over 12 million copies, while in North America several volumes have been featured in weekly top ten lists of best-selling manga. The anime has also been popular in both Japan and North America. Manga and anime critics had praise for ''Black Cat''{{'s}} action, differing views on the artwork and characters, and mainly negative comments for its plot which has been criticized for having typical elements of [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] (targeted at boys).\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Black Cat characters}}\nSet in a [[fictional universe]], [[Train Heartnet]], once an assassin for [[List of Black Cat characters#Chronos|Chronos]], an organization bent on world peace that rules one third of the world's economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed [[bounty hunter]]) traveling with his partner [[Sven Vollfied]]. They meet and team up with professional thief [[Rinslet Walker]] in order to break into an arms dealer's home and obtain some data, but encounter a human bio-weapon named [[Eve (Black Cat)|Eve]] that was created using [[nanotechnology]]. Sven and Train ultimately decide to free Eve from her owner and train her to be a Sweeper. Rinslet is kidnapped by [[Creed Diskenth]], a former Chronos assassin that killed Train's friend [[Saya Minatsuki]] for changing Train's outlook on life and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the [[Apostles of the Stars]] in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.\n\nThe Apostles of the Stars launch their first attack on the World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed in order to gain his help, though he resists, planning to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin [[Jenos Hazard]] is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert [[Dr. Tearju]], who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, [[Eathes]] was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide to put a stop to Creed.\n\nThey team up with a group called the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, organized by Chronos assassin [[Lin Shaolee]] in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. [[Sephiria Arks]] faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.\n\n==Production==\nSix months before ''Black Cat'' began, [[Kentaro Yabuki]]'s one-shot version titled ''Stray Cat'' was published.

The land of {{convert|29640|sqmi}} provided a more easily constructed route for a future southern [[transcontinental railroad]] line (second of the routes) for the future [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], constructed later in 1881/1883.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/dwe/87721.htm |title=Department of State \u2013 Gadsden Purchase |accessdate=2008-04-04 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Colorado Territory]] was established by the \"[[Colorado Organic Act]]\" on February 28, 1861, with the same boundaries that would ultimately constitute the [[State of Colorado]]. This Act removed the Colorado lands from the New Mexico Territory.\n\nThe creation of the Union [[Arizona Territory]] (two years after the ill-fated [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Arizona Territory]]) by the \"[[Arizona Organic Act]]\" on February 24, 1863, removed all the land west of the [[109th meridian west|109th meridian]] from the New Mexico Territory, i.e. the entire present-day [[State of Arizona]] plus the land that would become the southern part of the [[State of Nevada]] in 1864.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/03/10/90518536.pdf New York Times \u2013 The New Territory of Arizona]</ref> This Act left the New Mexico Territory with boundaries identical to the eventual [[State of New Mexico]] for a half-century until admitted to the Union in 1912 as the 47th state (followed just under six weeks later by the [[Arizona Territory]]/[[State of Arizona]], which became the 48th state, finally filling out the coast-to-coast continental expanse of the United States).\n\n==American Civil War==\n{{main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\nAs the route to [[California]], New Mexico Territory was disputed territory during the [[American Civil War]]. Settlers in the southern part of the Territory willingly joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in 1861 as the newly organized [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]], with a representative delegate to the [[Confederate Congress]] in the capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. This territory consisted of the southern half of the earlier Federal New Mexico Territory of 1851 and was in contrast to the later Federal [[Arizona Territory]] established by the [[United States|Union]] in 1863, which was the western half split off from the original U.S. New Mexico Territory. The short-lived Confederate Arizona Territory was the first American [[territorial entity]] to be called \"Arizona\".\n\nThe [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] in May 1862, following the retreat of Texan Confederate forces back south to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], placed the area of the [[Rio Grande]] valley and eastern New Mexico Territory with the capital of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] under the control of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Federals]] with their [[Union Army]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/91glorieta/91facts1.htm National Park Service \u2013 The Battle of Glorieta]</ref> However, the government and leadership of Confederate Arizona persisted until the end of the Civil War in June 1865 with the surrender of the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]], living in exile in [[El Paso, Texas]] with its delegate still in Richmond.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Colorado|Arizona|United States|History}}\n*[[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War]]\n*[[Governors of the Territory of New Mexico]]\n*[[History of New Mexico]]\n*[[Mexican\u2013American War]], 1846\u20131848\n*[[Territorial evolution of the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|New Mexico Territory}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*David L.
