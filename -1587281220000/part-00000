Major gaps in the range are the [[Goa Gap]], between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the [[Palghat Gap]] on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the [[Anaimalai Hills]]. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly [[monsoon]] winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests also contribute to the precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising [[orographic]] winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via [[transpiration]], allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.\n\nThe northern portion of the narrow coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the [[Arabian Sea]] is known as the [[Konkan Coast|Konkan]], the central portion is called [[Kanara]] and the southern portion is called [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]].

[[Kollur, Udupi district|Kollur in Udupi district]], Kokkali and [[Nilkund]] in [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]], [[Samse]] in [[Mudigere]] of [[Karnataka]], and [[Neriamangalam]] in the [[Ernakulam district]] of [[Kerala]] are the wettest places in the Western Ghats. Heavy precipitation does occur in the surrounding regions due to the long continuity of the mountains without passes and gaps. Changes in the direction and pace of the wind do affect the average rainfall and the wettest places might vary. However, [[Maharashtra]] and the northern part of Western Ghats in [[Karnataka]] on average receive heavier rainfall than [[Kerala]] and the southern part of Western Ghats in Karnataka.\n\nThe climate in the Western Ghats varies with altitudinal gradation and distance from the equator. The climate is humid and tropical in the lower reaches tempered by the proximity to the sea. Elevations of {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and above in the north and {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and above in the south have a more temperate climate. The average annual temperature is around {{convert|15|\u00b0C}}. In some parts frost is common, and temperatures reach the freezing point during the winter months. Mean temperatures range from {{convert|20|\u00b0C}} in the south to {{convert|24|\u00b0C}} in the north. It has also been observed that the coldest periods in the South Western Ghats coincide with the wettest.<ref name=\"WII\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wii.gov.in/envis/rain_forest/chapter2.htm|first=R.J.|last=Ranjit Daniels|title=Biodiversity of the Western Ghats \u2013 An Overview|access-date=19 March 2007|work=Wildlife Institute of India|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070228195706/http://www.wii.gov.in/envis/rain_forest/chapter2.htm|archivedate=28 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[monsoon|monsoon season]] between June and September, the unbroken Western Ghats chain acts as a barrier to the moisture-laden clouds. The heavy, eastward-moving rain-bearing clouds are forced to rise and in the process deposit most of their rain on the windward side. Rainfall in this region averages {{convert|300|cm}} to {{convert|400|cm}} with localised extremes reaching {{convert|900|cm}}. The eastern regions of the Western Ghats, which lie in the [[rain shadow]], receive far less rainfall (about {{convert|100|cm}}), resulting in an average rainfall of {{convert|250|cm}} across all regions. The total amount of rain does not depend on the spread of the area; areas in northern Maharashtra receive heavy rainfall followed by long dry spells, while regions closer to the equator receive less annual rainfall and have rain spells lasting several months in a year.<ref name=\"WII\"/>\n\n===Rainfall===\nThe Karnataka region on average receives heavier rainfall than the Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa.

The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion, with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of [[teak]]. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter [[North Western Ghats montane rain forests]], whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of the family ''[[Lauraceae]]''.\n\nThe evergreen forests in [[Wayanad]] mark the transition zone between the northern and southern ecoregions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecoregions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]], with ''[[Cullenia]]'' the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, [[dipterocarp]]s, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]], which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]], also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland forests, and dominated by evergreen trees, although some [[montane grassland]]s and stunted forests can be found at the highest elevations.

The structure of these molecules may be considered at any of several length scales ranging from the level of individual [[atom]]s to the relationships among entire [[protein subunits]]. This useful distinction among scales is often expressed as a decomposition of molecular structure into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The scaffold for this multiscale organization of the molecule arises at the secondary level, where the fundamental structural elements are the molecule's various [[hydrogen bond]]s. This leads to several recognizable ''domains'' of [[protein structure]] and [[nucleic acid structure]], including such secondary-structure features as [[alpha helix]]es and [[beta sheet]]s for proteins, and [[hairpin loop]]s, bulges, and internal loops for nucleic acids.\nThe terms ''primary'', ''secondary'', ''tertiary'', and ''quaternary structure'' were introduced by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang]] in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Primary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein primary structure|Nucleic acid primary structure}}\n\nThe ''primary structure'' of a [[biopolymer]] is the exact specification of its atomic composition and the chemical bonds connecting those atoms (including [[stereochemistry]]).  For a typical unbranched, un-crosslinked [[biopolymer]] (such as a [[molecule]] of a typical intracellular [[protein]], or of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]), the primary structure is equivalent to specifying the sequence of its [[monomer]]ic subunits, such as [[peptide sequence|peptides]] or [[nucleotide sequence|nucleotides]].\n\nPrimary structure is sometimes mistakenly termed ''primary sequence'', but there is no such term, as well as no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.  By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino terminal (N) to the carboxyl terminal (C), while the primary structure of DNA or RNA molecule is reported from the 5' end to the 3' end.\n\nThe primary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the exact sequence of nucleotides that comprise the whole molecule. Often, the primary structure encodes [[sequence motif]]s that are of functional importance. Some examples of such motifs are: the C/D<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Samarsky DA, Fournier MJ, Singer RH, Bertrand E | title = The snoRNA box C/D motif directs nucleolar targeting and also couples snoRNA synthesis and localization | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 13 | pages = 3747\u201357 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9649444 | pmc = 1170710 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/17.13.3747 }}</ref>\nand H/ACA boxes<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganot P, Caizergues-Ferrer M, Kiss T | title = The family of box ACA small nucleolar RNAs is defined by an evolutionarily conserved secondary structure and ubiquitous sequence elements essential for RNA accumulation | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 941\u201356 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9106664 | doi = 10.1101/gad.11.7.941 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nof [[snoRNA]]s, [[LSm]] binding site found in spliceosomal RNAs such as [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]], [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]], [[U4 spliceosomal RNA|U4]], [[U5 spliceosomal RNA|U5]], [[U6 spliceosomal RNA|U6]], [[U12 minor spliceosomal RNA|U12]] and [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]], the [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]],<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shine J, Dalgarno L | title = Determinant of cistron specificity in bacterial ribosomes | journal = Nature | volume = 254 | issue = 5495 | pages = 34\u201338 | date = March 1975 | pmid = 803646 | doi = 10.1038/254034a0 | bibcode = 1975Natur.254...34S }}</ref>\nthe [[Kozak consensus sequence]]<!--\n--><ref name=\"Kozak1987\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kozak M | title = An analysis of 5'-noncoding sequences from 699 vertebrate messenger RNAs | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 15 | issue = 20 | pages = 8125\u201348 | date = October 1987 | pmid = 3313277 | pmc = 306349 | doi = 10.1093/nar/15.20.8125 }}</ref>\nand the [[RNA polymerase III|RNA polymerase III terminator]]<!--\n-->.<ref name=\"pmid6263489\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogenhagen DF, Brown DD | title = Nucleotide sequences in Xenopus 5S DNA required for transcription termination | journal = Cell | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 261\u201370 | date = April 1981 | pmid = 6263489 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90522-5 }}</ref>\n\n==Secondary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein secondary structure|Nucleic acid secondary structure}}\n\n[[File:TRNA all2.png|250px|thumb|right|Secondary (inset) and tertiary structure of tRNA demonstrating coaxial stacking {{PDB| 6TNA}})]]\n\nThe ''secondary structure'' is the pattern of hydrogen bonds in a biopolymer.  These determine the general three-dimensional form of ''local segments'' of the biopolymers, but does not describe the global structure of specific atomic positions in three-dimensional space, which are considered to be [[#Tertiary structure|tertiary structure]].  Secondary structure is formally defined by the hydrogen bonds of the biopolymer, as observed in an atomic-resolution structure.  In proteins, the secondary structure is defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between backbone amine and carboxyl groups (sidechain\u2013mainchain and sidechain\u2013sidechain hydrogen bonds are irrelevant), where the [[DSSP (protein)|DSSP]] definition of a hydrogen bond is used.  In nucleic acids, the secondary structure is defined by the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases.\n\nFor proteins, however, the hydrogen bonding is correlated with other structural features, which has given rise to less formal definitions of secondary structure.  For example, helices can adopt backbone [[dihedral angle]]s in some regions of the [[Ramachandran plot]]; thus, a segment of residues with such dihedral angles is often called a ''helix'', regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds.  Many other less formal definitions have been proposed, often applying concepts from the [[differential geometry]] of curves, such as [[curvature]] and [[Torsion of a curve|torsion]].   Structural biologists solving a new atomic-resolution structure will sometimes assign its secondary structure ''by eye'' and record their assignments in the corresponding [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) file.\n\nThe secondary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the [[base pair]]ing interactions within one molecule or set of interacting molecules. The secondary structure of biological RNA's can often be uniquely decomposed into stems and loops. Often, these elements or combinations of them can be further classified, e.g. [[tetraloop]]s, [[pseudoknot]]s and [[stem loop]]s. There are many secondary structure elements of functional importance to biological RNA. Famous examples include the [[Intrinsic termination|Rho-independent terminator]] stem loops and the [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) cloverleaf.  There is a minor industry of researchers attempting to determine the secondary structure of RNA molecules. Approaches include both [[Nucleic acid structure determination|experimental]] and [[Nucleic acid structure prediction|computational]] methods (see also the [[List of RNA structure prediction software]]).\n\n==Tertiary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein tertiary structure|Nucleic acid tertiary structure}}\n\nThe ''tertiary structure'' of a [[protein]] or any other [[macromolecule]] is its three-dimensional structure, as defined by the atomic coordinates.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=tertiary structure|file=T06282}}</ref> Proteins and nucleic acids fold into complex three-dimensional structures which result in the molecules' functions. While such structures are diverse and complex, they are often composed of recurring, recognizable tertiary structure motifs and domains that serve as molecular building blocks. Tertiary structure is considered to be largely determined by the biomolecule's [[primary structure]] (its sequence of [[amino acid]]s or [[nucleotide]]s).\n\n==Quaternary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein quaternary structure|Nucleic acid quaternary structure}}\n\nThe ''quaternary structure'' refers to the number and arrangement of multiple protein molecules in a multi-subunit complex.

The structure of these molecules may be considered at any of several length scales ranging from the level of individual [[atom]]s to the relationships among entire [[protein subunits]]. This useful distinction among scales is often expressed as a decomposition of molecular structure into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The scaffold for this multiscale organization of the molecule arises at the secondary level, where the fundamental structural elements are the molecule's various [[hydrogen bond]]s. This leads to several recognizable ''domains'' of [[protein structure]] and [[nucleic acid structure]], including such secondary-structure features as [[alpha helix]]es and [[beta sheet]]s for proteins, and [[hairpin loop]]s, bulges, and internal loops for nucleic acids.\nThe terms ''primary'', ''secondary'', ''tertiary'', and ''quaternary structure'' were introduced by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang]] in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Primary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein primary structure|Nucleic acid primary structure}}\n\nThe ''primary structure'' of a [[biopolymer]] is the exact specification of its atomic composition and the chemical bonds connecting those atoms (including [[stereochemistry]]).  For a typical unbranched, un-crosslinked [[biopolymer]] (such as a [[molecule]] of a typical intracellular [[protein]], or of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]), the primary structure is equivalent to specifying the sequence of its [[monomer]]ic subunits, such as [[peptide sequence|peptides]] or [[nucleotide sequence|nucleotides]].\n\nPrimary structure is sometimes mistakenly termed ''primary sequence'', but there is no such term, as well as no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.  By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino terminal (N) to the carboxyl terminal (C), while the primary structure of DNA or RNA molecule is reported from the 5' end to the 3' end.\n\nThe primary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the exact sequence of nucleotides that comprise the whole molecule. Often, the primary structure encodes [[sequence motif]]s that are of functional importance. Some examples of such motifs are: the C/D<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Samarsky DA, Fournier MJ, Singer RH, Bertrand E | title = The snoRNA box C/D motif directs nucleolar targeting and also couples snoRNA synthesis and localization | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 13 | pages = 3747\u201357 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9649444 | pmc = 1170710 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/17.13.3747 }}</ref>\nand H/ACA boxes<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganot P, Caizergues-Ferrer M, Kiss T | title = The family of box ACA small nucleolar RNAs is defined by an evolutionarily conserved secondary structure and ubiquitous sequence elements essential for RNA accumulation | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 941\u201356 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9106664 | doi = 10.1101/gad.11.7.941 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nof [[snoRNA]]s, [[LSm]] binding site found in spliceosomal RNAs such as [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]], [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]], [[U4 spliceosomal RNA|U4]], [[U5 spliceosomal RNA|U5]], [[U6 spliceosomal RNA|U6]], [[U12 minor spliceosomal RNA|U12]] and [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]], the [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]],<!--\n--><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shine J, Dalgarno L | title = Determinant of cistron specificity in bacterial ribosomes | journal = Nature | volume = 254 | issue = 5495 | pages = 34\u201338 | date = March 1975 | pmid = 803646 | doi = 10.1038/254034a0 | bibcode = 1975Natur.254...34S }}</ref>\nthe [[Kozak consensus sequence]]<!--\n--><ref name=\"Kozak1987\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kozak M | title = An analysis of 5'-noncoding sequences from 699 vertebrate messenger RNAs | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 15 | issue = 20 | pages = 8125\u201348 | date = October 1987 | pmid = 3313277 | pmc = 306349 | doi = 10.1093/nar/15.20.8125 }}</ref>\nand the [[RNA polymerase III|RNA polymerase III terminator]]<!--\n-->.<ref name=\"pmid6263489\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogenhagen DF, Brown DD | title = Nucleotide sequences in Xenopus 5S DNA required for transcription termination | journal = Cell | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 261\u201370 | date = April 1981 | pmid = 6263489 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90522-5 }}</ref>\n\n==Secondary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein secondary structure|Nucleic acid secondary structure}}\n\n[[File:TRNA all2.png|250px|thumb|right|Secondary (inset) and tertiary structure of tRNA demonstrating coaxial stacking {{PDB| 6TNA}})]]\n\nThe ''secondary structure'' is the pattern of hydrogen bonds in a biopolymer.  These determine the general three-dimensional form of ''local segments'' of the biopolymers, but does not describe the global structure of specific atomic positions in three-dimensional space, which are considered to be [[#Tertiary structure|tertiary structure]].  Secondary structure is formally defined by the hydrogen bonds of the biopolymer, as observed in an atomic-resolution structure.  In proteins, the secondary structure is defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between backbone amine and carboxyl groups (sidechain\u2013mainchain and sidechain\u2013sidechain hydrogen bonds are irrelevant), where the [[DSSP (protein)|DSSP]] definition of a hydrogen bond is used.  In nucleic acids, the secondary structure is defined by the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases.\n\nFor proteins, however, the hydrogen bonding is correlated with other structural features, which has given rise to less formal definitions of secondary structure.  For example, helices can adopt backbone [[dihedral angle]]s in some regions of the [[Ramachandran plot]]; thus, a segment of residues with such dihedral angles is often called a ''helix'', regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds.  Many other less formal definitions have been proposed, often applying concepts from the [[differential geometry]] of curves, such as [[curvature]] and [[Torsion of a curve|torsion]].   Structural biologists solving a new atomic-resolution structure will sometimes assign its secondary structure ''by eye'' and record their assignments in the corresponding [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) file.\n\nThe secondary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the [[base pair]]ing interactions within one molecule or set of interacting molecules. The secondary structure of biological RNA's can often be uniquely decomposed into stems and loops. Often, these elements or combinations of them can be further classified, e.g. [[tetraloop]]s, [[pseudoknot]]s and [[stem loop]]s. There are many secondary structure elements of functional importance to biological RNA. Famous examples include the [[Intrinsic termination|Rho-independent terminator]] stem loops and the [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) cloverleaf.  There is a minor industry of researchers attempting to determine the secondary structure of RNA molecules. Approaches include both [[Nucleic acid structure determination|experimental]] and [[Nucleic acid structure prediction|computational]] methods (see also the [[List of RNA structure prediction software]]).\n\n==Tertiary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein tertiary structure|Nucleic acid tertiary structure}}\n\nThe ''tertiary structure'' of a [[protein]] or any other [[macromolecule]] is its three-dimensional structure, as defined by the atomic coordinates.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=tertiary structure|file=T06282}}</ref> Proteins and nucleic acids fold into complex three-dimensional structures which result in the molecules' functions. While such structures are diverse and complex, they are often composed of recurring, recognizable tertiary structure motifs and domains that serve as molecular building blocks. Tertiary structure is considered to be largely determined by the biomolecule's [[primary structure]] (its sequence of [[amino acid]]s or [[nucleotide]]s).\n\n==Quaternary structure==\n\n{{Further|Protein quaternary structure|Nucleic acid quaternary structure}}\n\nThe ''quaternary structure'' refers to the number and arrangement of multiple protein molecules in a multi-subunit complex.

It has two terminals. The old terminal is used for domestic flights and the new terminal is for international flights. The airport serves the surrounding tourist areas and environs of [[Dalaman]]. Flights are available to and from over 120 destinations, across the rest of Turkey, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n==History==\nThe construction of Dalaman airport was begun in 1976, and it opened in 1981 as an ''aerodrome''. In 1989, it was promoted to ''airport'' status. The airport extends over an area of 6.15 million m\u00b2.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=AERODROME HISTORY|url=http://www.dalaman.dhmi.gov.tr/havaalanlari/page.aspx?hv=5&mnu=1158|website=dalaman.dhmi.gov.tr}}</ref>\n\nThe new Dalaman International Terminal cost approximately $150,000,000 to complete and is the third largest terminal building in Turkey.<ref name=\"atmairport.aero\">[http://www.atmairport.aero/Dalaman_en/terminal.php Terminal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005211714/http://www.atmairport.aero/Dalaman_en/terminal.php |date=5 October 2008 }} ATM Dalaman Airport</ref> There are 12 boarding gates, 8 with covered airbridges. The apron was also re-designed, increasing space for remote stands. Consequently, the airport has capacity to handle up to 35 flights at any one time. In total, the terminal now has a floor space of 95,000m<sup>2</sup>, compared with less than 45,000m<sup>2</sup> prior to refurbishment.<ref name=\"atmairport.aero\"/> Check-in and departures are based on the upper two levels, with arrivals using the lower two levels. The old terminal building is still in use and operated as the domestic terminal.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- WHEN ADDING NEW DESTINATIONS OR END DATES FOR DESTINATIONS, PLEASE PROVIDE A REFERENCE.

It has two terminals. The old terminal is used for domestic flights and the new terminal is for international flights. The airport serves the surrounding tourist areas and environs of [[Dalaman]]. Flights are available to and from over 120 destinations, across the rest of Turkey, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n==History==\nThe construction of Dalaman airport was begun in 1976, and it opened in 1981 as an ''aerodrome''. In 1989, it was promoted to ''airport'' status. The airport extends over an area of 6.15 million m\u00b2.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=AERODROME HISTORY|url=http://www.dalaman.dhmi.gov.tr/havaalanlari/page.aspx?hv=5&mnu=1158|website=dalaman.dhmi.gov.tr}}</ref>\n\nThe new Dalaman International Terminal cost approximately $150,000,000 to complete and is the third largest terminal building in Turkey.<ref name=\"atmairport.aero\">[http://www.atmairport.aero/Dalaman_en/terminal.php Terminal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005211714/http://www.atmairport.aero/Dalaman_en/terminal.php |date=5 October 2008 }} ATM Dalaman Airport</ref> There are 12 boarding gates, 8 with covered airbridges. The apron was also re-designed, increasing space for remote stands. Consequently, the airport has capacity to handle up to 35 flights at any one time. In total, the terminal now has a floor space of 95,000m<sup>2</sup>, compared with less than 45,000m<sup>2</sup> prior to refurbishment.<ref name=\"atmairport.aero\"/> Check-in and departures are based on the upper two levels, with arrivals using the lower two levels. The old terminal building is still in use and operated as the domestic terminal.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- WHEN ADDING NEW DESTINATIONS OR END DATES FOR DESTINATIONS, PLEASE PROVIDE A REFERENCE.
