In the second half of the 12th century, there was a sudden intensification of activity, leading to a 60-year \"golden age\" of medieval German literature referred to as the ''mittelhochdeutsche Bl\u00fctezeit'' (1170\u20131230). This was the period of the blossoming of MHG lyric poetry, particularly ''[[Minnesang]]'' (the German variety of the originally French tradition of [[courtly love]]). The same sixty years saw the composition of the most important courtly romances. These are written in rhyming couplets, and again draw on French models such as [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]], many of them relating [[Arthurian]] material. The third literary movement of these years was a new revamping of the heroic tradition, in which the ancient Germanic oral tradition can still be discerned, but tamed and Christianized and adapted for the court. These high medieval [[heroic epic]]s are written in rhymed strophes, not the alliterative verse of Germanic prehistory.\n\n==Genres==\n=== Epic Poetry ===\nThe ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' is one of the first monuments of Middle High German. The three key authors of courtly romances are [[Hartmann von Aue]], [[Gottfried von Strassburg]], and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], in particular his ''[[Parzival]]'', which is regarded as one of the supreme literary achievements of the period. The revamping of the heroic tradition is visible in works like the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', ''[[Kudrun]]'', and the various epics about the heroic figure [[Dietrich von Bern]]. Another epic of the High Middle Ages is ''[[Herzog Ernst]]''; other authors include [[Konrad von W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Rudolf von Ems]], and [[Ulrich von T\u00fcrheim]].\n\n=== Lyric Poetry ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Walther von der Vogelweide.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], the most celebrated of all medieval German lyric poets, from the [[Codex Manesse]]]]\nThe most impressive example of Early Middle High German lyric poetry is the ''[[Annolied]]'' or ''Song of Anno''. Towards the beginning of the twelfth century A.D., the poetess [[Ava (poet)|Ava]] became the first woman to write poetry in German.\n\nDuring the Middle High German period, ''[[Minnesang|Minnes\u00e4nge]]'', songs about courtly love, were very popular. The most notable of all the ''Minnes\u00e4nger'' was [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], whose most famous ''Minnesang'' is the poem \"[[Unter der Linden]]\", but there were also many others. Some of the melodies for these ''Minnes\u00e4nge'' have survived to the present day, but most have been lost. The only one of Walther's songs for which the melody has survived is the ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'', which is not a ''Minnesang''.<ref>Meinolf Schumacher: \"Die Konstituierung des \"Heiligen Landes\u201c durch die Literatur.

Three fourteenth-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] authors are particularly important: [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Henry Suso]] (also known as Heinrich Seuse), and [[Johannes Tauler]].

The period between 1350 and 1500 is one of transition between the Late Middle Ages and the [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In the German literature of the 15th century, medieval genres (such as the latest works of classical ''[[Minnesang]]'') overlap with works of early [[Humanism]], and by the end of the 15th century early popular literature in the form of the ''[[Volksbuch]]'' (''[[Fortunatus (book)|Fortunatus]], [[Till Eulenspiegel]]'').<ref>\nDorothea Klein, 'Wann endet das Sp\u00e4tmittelalter in der Geschichte der deutschen Literatur?'

Other poets include [[Hans Folz]], [[Johannes von Tepl]], and [[Sebastian Brant]].\n\n== Judeo-German ==\n{{main|Old Yiddish literature}}\nFrom the late 13th century, there is evidence of the beginnings of the [[Yiddish]] language, which in the early phase is a variety of Middle High German, not distinct enough even to be described as a dialect, but written in Hebrew characters.
