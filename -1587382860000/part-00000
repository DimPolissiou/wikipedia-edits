She associates this unorthodox childhood with her writing practice: \u201cI withdrew,\u201d Zinnes told Contemporary Authors. \u201cI had been writing since I was six years old \u2013 everyone always called me a poet: teasingly, affectionately, and perhaps in that American way, a bit scoffingly at one who seemed not to be able to cope with the practical. Things were still difficult when I reached college age. In Massachusetts I would have gone to Latin High, and then to Radcliffe, perhaps. Instead, living in New York, I went to [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] (then a fine academic school), and found my way as a writer. I became editor of the school paper \u2013 and wrote poem after poem.\u201d<ref name=\"contemporary\"/>\n\nShe received her Bachelor\u2019s degree at Hunter College (now Hunter College of the City University of New York) in 1939.\n\nWhile she studied at [[Hunter College]], Zinnes became more involved in the New York art scene. At Hunter, she noticed a lack of intellectual rigor throughout the literature department. Because of this, she was drawn to the philosophy department: \u201cI found philosophy more challenging than literature classes that were geared not even to the New Criticism. The professors were still teaching literature as if it were merely a manifestation of history.\u201d<ref name=\"student\"/>\n\nOn September 24, 1943, Zinnes married Irving I. Zinnes, a professor of physics at [[Fordham University]]. \u201cI married early,\u201d Zinnes remembers, though she continued her track as a writer on her own. The metaphysical currents of her writing, tied to different notions of science and philosophy, demonstrate the ways in which non-aesthetic resources came to inform her writing. Borrowing language and concepts from physics, she was able to create a broader, experimental relationship between disciplines.<ref name=\"student\"/>\n\nZinnes went on to complete her Master\u2019s degree at Brooklyn College (now Brooklyn College of the City University of New York) in 1944, and her Ph.D., in 1953 at [[New York University]]. Her dissertation was on [[Alexander Pope]]\u2019s long poem [[Dunciad]] (1743), which became a major formal influence on Zinnes\u2019s own poetic output, even as a force to work against. As Eric Williamson puts it, \u201cWhereas Pope\u2019s work is limited by the notion of form in the Neoclassical tradition, Zinnes\u2019s work is free of form and limited only by the imagination.\u201d<ref name=\"conte\">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: American Poets Since World War II, Sixth Series, Volume 193. |last=Conte |first= Joseph |publisher= |year=1998 |isbn=9780787618483|location= |pages=364-373}}</ref>\n\nZinnes taught at a variety of schools including Rutgers University, University of Geneva, and Queens College of the City University of New York. It was Queens College where she would spend most of her career, teaching there between 1949-1953, and then returning in 1962 as an instructor.

She authored 11 books of poetry and 2 collections of short stories.<ref name=\"publishers\">[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-918273-46-8 Publishers Weekly: Lover - Harriet Zinnes (specifically Robert Smithson\u2019s writing about entropy and site-specific art)]</ref> Her writing, informed by many disparate traditions and styles, demonstrates the various currents and trends of the American literary tradition in the 20th century, from the \u201cfound poem\u201d \u00e0 la William Carlos Williams and Marcel Duchamp, to the ekphrastic verse, to the \u201cproprioceptive\u201d \u201ccomposition by field\u201d championed by [[Charles Olson]] in his essay \u201cProjective Verse\u201d, to the more cerebral poetics trends of the 1960s.\n\nZinnes said that her major early influences were Ezra Pound, [[T.S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and the French poets [[Stephane Mallarme]], [[Charles-Pierre Baudelaire]], and Paul-Toissaint-Jules Valery, which can be seen in two of her early publications (An Eye For An Eye and I Wanted to See Something Flying).<ref name=\"conte\"/> Other influences include the erotic writing of [[Ana\u00efs Nin]], the stream-of-consciousness long poems of the [[Beat Generation]], and the conceptual techniques of artists such as [[Robert Smithson]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who brought non-aesthetic objects into the aesthetic sphere (see Entropisms).<ref name=\"conte\"/>\n\nAs with her poetry, Zinnes\u2019s fiction is also more concerned with the literary experiment (see Lover, The Radiant Absurdity of Desire).<ref name=\"publishers\"/>\n\nIn 1988, Schocken Books published Blood and Feathers, Zinnes\u2019s translation of selected poems by midcentury French poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr\u00e9vert.

She used her critical visual acumen to inform both her poetry and her work as a literary scholar. In a compendium on the poet Ezra Pound\u2019s relationship to the arts (see her edited collection of Pound\u2019s art writing, Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts), she writes that \u201cPound\u2019s art criticism \u2026 is \u2026 not just occasionally significant in itself but is also of special interest as the continuation by an American writer of a tradition [of poetry].\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts |last=Zinnes |first=Harriet |publisher=New Dircetions |year=1980 |isbn=9780811217835 |location= |pages= }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her several books of poetry, Zinnes was published in numerous journals and periodicals including AGNI,<ref>[https://agnionli people/authors/harriet-zinnes AGNI Online: Harriet Zinnes]</ref> American Poetry Review,<ref>[https://aprweb.org/issue-index/2001-may-june The American Poetry Review:VOLUME 30 NO. 03 MAY/JUNE]</ref> Denver Quarterly,<ref>[https://www.du.edu/denverquarterly/index.html Denver Quarterly: Experimenting in the Literary Arts Since 1965]</ref> The Manhattan Review,<ref>[https://themanhattanreview.com/issues/vol9no1 The Manhattan Review: Volume 9, no. 1 SPRING 1999]</ref> NY Arts,<ref>[http://nyartsmagazine.net/?s=harriet+zinnes NY Arts Magazine: Harriet Zinners]</ref> and more.\n\n==Critical acclaim==\n\nBurt Kimmelman, in his article ''The dead and the living: Hugh Seidman\u2019s late poems'', wrote: \"I\u2019ve thought a lot about William Bronk\u2019s concise, dense, late statements. They don\u2019t possess the majestic sweep of his poems at middle age (in terms of line length, overall volume, the philosophical punch in the solar plexus). Bronk\u2019s late poems, however, hold their own, and they do seem typically Bronk. For me the comparison here is with someone like Harriet Zinnes; her late poems \u2014 their ethereal, sprightly, fleetingly brilliant statements seeming to have come from beyond the veil \u2014 are exciting in their exquisite lightness yet fascination that doesn\u2019t dissipate. Zinnes\u2019s last poems are supremely graceful, intelligent, paradoxically profound in their sheer defiance of gravity. Yet I\u2019d not be surprised to find readers of her work, over the years, keeping to mind poems of hers written when she was at, say, full strength, which they know well, feeling the late poems to be a distinct leave-taking. They strike me as drawing upon the same wellspring of insight, finally, and as possessing an eerie gracefulness \u2014 less on display in her work of middle age, obfuscated there by something grander in presentation. That earlier work, not diminished by what would come, probably remains what her readers will embrace.\"<ref>[http://jacket2.org/article/dead-and-living Jaket2: The dead and the living Hugh Seidman\u2019s late poems (by Burt Kimmelman)]</ref>\n\n[[American Book Review]] noted: \"Zinnes expects the reader to know modern art and much literature.

In a compendium on the poet Ezra Pound\u2019s relationship to the arts (see her edited collection of Pound\u2019s art writing, Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts), she writes that \u201cPound\u2019s art criticism \u2026 is \u2026 not just occasionally significant in itself but is also of special interest as the continuation by an American writer of a tradition [of poetry].\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts |last=Zinnes |first=Harriet |publisher=New Dircetions |year=1980 |isbn=9780811217835 |location= |pages= }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her several books of poetry, Zinnes was published in numerous journals and periodicals including AGNI,<ref>[https://agnionli people/authors/harriet-zinnes AGNI Online: Harriet Zinnes]</ref> American Poetry Review,<ref>[https://aprweb.org/issue-index/2001-may-june The American Poetry Review:VOLUME 30 NO. 03 MAY/JUNE]</ref> Denver Quarterly,<ref>[https://www.du.edu/denverquarterly/index.html Denver Quarterly: Experimenting in the Literary Arts Since 1965]</ref> The Manhattan Review,<ref>[https://themanhattanreview.com/issues/vol9no1 The Manhattan Review: Volume 9, no. 1 SPRING 1999]</ref> NY Arts,<ref>[http://nyartsmagazine.net/?s=harriet+zinnes NY Arts Magazine: Harriet Zinners]</ref> and more.\n\n==Critical acclaim==\n\nBurt Kimmelman, in his article ''The dead and the living: Hugh Seidman\u2019s late poems'', wrote: \"I\u2019ve thought a lot about William Bronk\u2019s concise, dense, late statements. They don\u2019t possess the majestic sweep of his poems at middle age (in terms of line length, overall volume, the philosophical punch in the solar plexus). Bronk\u2019s late poems, however, hold their own, and they do seem typically Bronk. For me the comparison here is with someone like Harriet Zinnes; her late poems \u2014 their ethereal, sprightly, fleetingly brilliant statements seeming to have come from beyond the veil \u2014 are exciting in their exquisite lightness yet fascination that doesn\u2019t dissipate. Zinnes\u2019s last poems are supremely graceful, intelligent, paradoxically profound in their sheer defiance of gravity. Yet I\u2019d not be surprised to find readers of her work, over the years, keeping to mind poems of hers written when she was at, say, full strength, which they know well, feeling the late poems to be a distinct leave-taking. They strike me as drawing upon the same wellspring of insight, finally, and as possessing an eerie gracefulness \u2014 less on display in her work of middle age, obfuscated there by something grander in presentation. That earlier work, not diminished by what would come, probably remains what her readers will embrace.\"<ref>[http://jacket2.org/article/dead-and-living Jaket2: The dead and the living Hugh Seidman\u2019s late poems (by Burt Kimmelman)]</ref>\n\n[[American Book Review]] noted: \"Zinnes expects the reader to know modern art and much literature.

Typically only {{IPA|/k, t\u0283, \u0261, j, \u0283, h/}} are analyzed as separate phonemes; {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} is considered an allophone of {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} allophones of {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\nHistorically, {{IPA|/t\u0283, \u0283/}} developed from {{IPA|/k, sk/}} by [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and some cases of {{IPA|/j/}} developed from palatalization of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, while others developed from Proto-Germanic {{PIE|*j}}. (Although this palatalization occurred as a regular sound change, later vowel changes and [[loan word|borrowings]] meant that the occurrence of the palatal forms was no longer predictable, that is, the palatals and the velars had become separate [[phoneme]]s.) Both the velars {{IPA|/k, \u0261/}} (including {{IPA|[\u0263]}}) and the palatals {{IPA|/t\u0283, j/}} (including {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}) are [[Old English orthography|spelled]] as {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|g}}}} in Old English manuscripts.\n\nIn modern texts, the palatalized versions may be written with a [[dot (diacritic)|dot above the letter]]: {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. (As just mentioned, it would otherwise not generally be possible to predict whether a palatal or velar is meant, although there are certain common patterns; for example, {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}} often has the palatalized sound before the front vowels {{vr|{{lang|ang|i}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|e}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u00e6}}}}. Note that Old English had palatalized {{vr|g}} in certain words that have [[hard G]] in Modern English due to [[Scandinavian influence on English|Old Norse influence]], such as {{lang|ang|\u0121iefan}} \"give\" and {{lang|ang|\u0121eat}} \"gate\".)\n\n{{IPA|/j/}} was pronounced as {{IPA|[j]}} in most cases, but as the affricate {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} after {{IPA|/n/}} or when [[gemination|geminated]] ([[fortition]]). The voiced velar stop {{IPA|/\u0261/}} was pronounced as a fricative {{IPA|[\u0263]}} after a vowel or [[liquid consonant|liquid]]. At the end of a word, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} was [[consonant voicing and devoicing|devoiced]] to an allophone of {{IPA|/h/}} (such as {{IPA|[x]}}; see below). Because of this, and the palatalization referred to above, the phonemes {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/h/}} [[alternation (linguistics)|alternate]] in the inflectional forms of some words.\n* {{lang|ang|n\u00e6\u0121l}} ('nail') {{IPA|/\u02c8n\u00e6jl/}}\n* {{lang|ang|d\u00e6\u0121}} ('day') {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u00e6j/}}\n: {{lang|ang|d\u00e6\u0121es}} ({{sc|gen.sg}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u00e6jes/}}\n: {{lang|ang|dagas}} ({{sc|nom.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u0261\u0251s/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0251\u0263\u0251s]}}\n: {{lang|ang|dagung}} ('dawn') {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u0261un\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0251\u0263u\u014b\u0261]}}\n* {{lang|ang|burg}}, {{lang|ang|burh}} ('castle') {{IPA|/bur\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[burx]}} (~ {{IPA|/burh/}})\n: {{lang|ang|burgum}} ({{sc|dat.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8bur\u0261um/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8bur\u0263um]}}\n: {{lang|ang|byri\u0121}} ({{sc|nom.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8byrij/}}\n* {{lang|ang|sen\u0121an}} ('to singe') {{IPA|/\u02c8senjan/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8send\u0292\u0251n]}} (from {{PIE|*sangijan}})\n* {{lang|ang|bry\u010b\u0121}} ('bridge') {{IPA|/bryjj/}} > {{IPA|[brydd\u0292]}} (from {{PIE|*bruggj\u014d}} < {{PIE|*bru\u0263j\u014d}})\n\nIn [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] and probably early Old English, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} appeared in initial position as well, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}} was best considered an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0263/}}, occurring only after a [[nasal stop|nasal]] or when geminated. But after {{IPA|[\u0263]}} became {{IPA|[\u0261]}} word-initially in Old English, it makes sense to consider the [[stop consonant|stop]] the basic form and the [[fricative consonant|fricative]] the allophone.\n\n{{IPA|[\u00e7, x]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/h/}} occurring in [[syllable coda|coda]] position after front and back vowels respectively.\n* {{lang|ang|cniht}} ('boy') {{IPA|/kniht/}} > {{IPA|[kni\u00e7t]}}\n* {{lang|ang|\u0121e\u00fe\u014dht}} ('thought') {{IPA|/je\u02c8\u03b8o\u02d0ht/}} > {{IPA|[je\u02c8\u03b8o\u02d0xt]}}\n\nThe evidence for the allophone {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after front vowels is indirect, as it is not indicated in the orthography. Nevertheless, the fact that there was historically a fronting of {{PIE|*k}} to {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and of {{PIE|*\u0263}} to {{IPA|/j/}} after front vowels makes it very likely. Moreover, in late [[Middle English]], {{IPA|/h/}} sometimes became {{IPA|/f/}} (e.g. ''tough'', ''cough''), but only after back vowels, never after front vowels. This is explained if we assume that the allophone {{IPA|[x]}} sometimes became {{IPA|[f]}} but the allophone {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} never did.\n\n==== Sonorants ====\n{{IPA|[\u014b]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} occurring before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}. Words that have [[NG-coalescence|final {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in standard Modern English]] have the cluster {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261]}} in Old English.\n* {{lang|ang|sincan}} ('sink') {{IPA|/\u02c8sink\u0251n/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8si\u014bk\u0251n]}}\n* {{lang|ang|hring}} ('ring') {{IPA|/hrin\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[r\u0325i\u014b\u0261]}}\n\nThe exact nature of Old English {{IPA|/r/}} is not known. It may have been an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in most Modern English accents, an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, or an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\nThe sequences {{IPA|/hw, hl, hn, hr/}} were pronounced as [[Sonorant#Voiceless|voiceless sonorants]] {{IPA|[\u028d, l\u0325, n\u0325, r\u0325]}}.

This is suggested by the vowel shifts of [[#Origin of diphthongs|breaking and retraction]] before {{IPA|/l r/}}, which could be cases of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following velar consonant:\n* {{lang|ang|*lirnian}} > {{lang|ang|liornian}} > {{lang|ang|leornian}} {{IPA|[\u02c8leo\u032fr\u02e0nian]}} ('learn')\n* {{lang|ang|*er\u00fee}} > {{lang|ang|eor\u00fee}} {{IPA|[\u02c8eo\u032fr\u02e0\u00f0e]}}\n* {{lang|ang|*f\u00e6llan}} > {{lang|ang|feallan}} {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u0251\u032f\u026b\u026b\u0251n]}} ('fall')\nDue to [[#Phonotactics|phonotactic constraints]] on initial clusters, \u27e8wr\u27e9 and \u27e8wl\u27e9 are thought by some to be [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] representing these velarized sounds, in which case the distinction was phonemic:<ref name=\"fisiak\">{{cite journal |last1=Fisiak |first1=Jacek |date=Jan 1967 |title= The Old English \u27e8wr-\u27e9 and \u27e8wl-\u27e9 |url= |journal=[[Linguistics (journal)|Linguistics]] |volume=5 |issue=32 |pages=12\u201314 |doi=10.1515/ling.1967.5.32.12 }}</ref>\n* {{lang|ang|\u01bfr\u012bdan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8r\u02e0i\u02d0d\u0251n]}} \"to grow\"\n* {{lang|ang|r\u012bdan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8ri\u02d0d\u0251n]}} \"to ride\"\n* {{lang|ang|\u01bfl\u012btan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8\u026bi\u02d0t\u0251n]}} \"to look\"\n* {{lang|ang|l\u012btan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0t\u0251n]}} \"to bend\"\n\nHowever, this theory is inconsistent with orthoepic evidence from the [[Early Modern English]] era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=27 January 2000 |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language Volume 3 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=CCvMbntWth8C |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=64 |isbn=9780521264761 |author-link=Roger Lass }}\n</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nOld English had a moderately large vowel system. In [[stress (linguistics)|stressed syllables]], both monophthongs and diphthongs had short and long versions, which were clearly distinguished in pronunciation. In unstressed syllables, vowels were [[vowel reduction|reduced]] or [[elision|elided]], though not as much as in Modern English.\n\n==== Monophthongs ====\nOld English had seven or eight [[Vowel#Quality|vowel qualities]], depending on [[Old English dialects|dialect]], and each could appear  as either a long or short [[monophthong]]. An example of a pair of words distinguished by vowel length is {{lang|ang|god}} {{IPA|[\u0261od]}} ('god') and {{lang|ang|g\u014dd}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u02d0d]}} ('good').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! <small>unrounded</small>\n! <small>[[rounded vowel|rounded]]</small>\n! <small>unrounded</small>\n! <small>rounded</small>\n|-\n!

Like monophthongs, diphthongs appear to have had [[vowel length|short and long]] versions. In modern texts, long diphthongs are marked with a macron on the first letter. The short versions behave like short monophthongs, and the long versions like long monophthongs. Most Old English diphthongs consist of a front vowel followed by a back offglide; according to some analyses they were in fact front vowels followed by a velarized consonant.<ref name=\"diphthongs\">{{Harvnb|Hogg|1992|pp=101\u2013105}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schrijver|2014|pp=87\u201391}}</ref> The diphthongs tend to be [[height-harmonic]], meaning that both parts of the diphthong had the same [[vowel height]] (high, mid or low).\n\nThe [[Anglian dialects]] had the following diphthongs:<ref name=\"diphthongs\" />\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!

Earlier West Saxon, however, had an additional pair of long and short diphthongs written {{lang|ang|ie}} (distinguished as {{lang|ang|ie}} and {{lang|ang|\u012be}} in modern editions), which developed from i-mutation or umlaut of {{lang|ang|eo}} or {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113o}} or {{lang|ang|\u0113a}}. Scholars do not agree on how they were pronounced; they may have been {{IPA|[ie\u032f i\u02d0e\u032f]}} or {{IPA|[iy\u032f i\u02d0y\u032f]}}. They were apparently monophothongized by [[Alfred the Great]]'s time, to a vowel whose pronunciation is still uncertain, but is known as \"unstable ''i''\". This later went on to merge with {{IPA|/y y\u02d0/}}, according to spellings such as {{lang|ang|gelyfan}}, for earlier {{lang|ang|geliefan}} and {{lang|ang|gelifan}} ('to believe').<ref>Quirk, R., Wreenn, C.L., ''An Old English Grammar'', Psychology Press, 1957, p. 140.</ref> (According to another interpretation, however, the \"unstable i\" may simply have been {{IPA|/i/}}, and the later {{IPA|/y/}} can be explained by the fact that Late West Saxon was not a direct descendant of Early West Saxon. See [[Old English dialects]].) This produced additional instances of {{IPA|/y(\u02d0)/}} alongside those that developed from [[Germanic umlaut#I-mutation in Old English|i-mutation]] and from sporadic rounding of {{IPA|/i(\u02d0)/}} in certain circumstances (e.g. {{lang|ang|my\u010bel}} 'much' from earlier {{lang|ang|mi\u010bel}}, with rounding perhaps triggered by the rounded {{IPA|/m/}}). All instances of {{IPA|/y(\u02d0)/}} were normally unrounded next to {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|g}}}} and {{vr|{{lang|ang|h}}}}, hence {{lang|ang|gifan}} from earlier {{lang|ang|giefan}} 'to give'.\n\n==== Origin of diphthongs ====\n{{further|Phonological history of Old English}}\nOld English diphthongs have several origins, either from Proto-Germanic or from Old English vowel shifts. Long diphthongs developed partly from the Proto-Germanic diphthongs {{PIE|*iu, *eu, *au}} and partly from the Old English vowel shifts, while the short diphthongs developed only from Old English vowel shifts. These are examples of diphthongs inherited from Proto-Germanic:\n* PG {{PIE|*biun}} > Anglian {{lang|ang|b\u012bon}}, West Saxon {{lang|ang|b\u0113on}} 'be'\n* PG {{PIE|*deur}} > OE {{lang|ang|d\u0113or}} 'animal' > Modern English {{lang|ang|deer}}\n* PG {{PIE|*dau\u00fe}} > OE {{lang|ang|d\u0113a\u00fe}} 'death'\n\nThere are three vowel shifts that resulted in diphthongs: breaking, palatal diphthongization, and back mutation. Through breaking, Anglo-Frisian short {{PIE|*i, *e, *\u00e6}} developed into the short diphthongs {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|ea}} before {{IPA|/h, w/}} or a consonant cluster beginning with {{IPA|/r, l/}}, and Anglo-Frisian long {{PIE|*\u012b, *\u01e3}} developed into the diphthongs {{lang|ang|\u012bo}} and {{lang|ang|\u0113a}} before {{IPA|/h/}}. Palatal diphthongization changed {{lang|ang|e}}, {{lang|ang|\u00e6}} and {{lang|ang|a}}, {{lang|ang|\u01e3}}, {{lang|ang|u}} and {{lang|ang|o}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113}} to the diphthongs {{lang|ang|ie}}, {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113o}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113a}} respectively after the palatalized consonants {{lang|ang|\u0121}}, {{lang|ang|s\u010b}}, and {{lang|ang|\u010b}} (though this may have only been a spelling change). Back mutation changed {{lang|ang|i}}, {{lang|ang|e}}, and sometimes {{lang|ang|a}} to {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, and {{lang|ang|ea}} before a back vowel in the next syllable.\n* PG {{PIE|*lizn\u014djan\u0105}} > Anglo-Frisian {{PIE|*lirnian}} > Anglian {{lang|ang|liornian}}, West Saxon ''leornian'' 'learn' (breaking)\n* PG {{PIE|*n\u0101h}} > AF {{PIE|*n\u01e3h}} > Old English {{lang|ang|n\u0113ah}} 'near' (breaking)\n* PG {{PIE|*geban\u0105}} > AF {{PIE|*jefan}} > {{lang|ang|\u0121iefan}} 'give' (palatal diphthongization)\n* PG {{PIE|*sebun}} > AF {{PIE|*sefon}} > OE {{lang|ang|seofon}} 'seven' (back mutation)\n\nScholars disagree on whether short diphthongs are phonologically possible, and some say that Old English short diphthongs must actually have been centralized vowels. Hogg argues against this, saying that a length contrast in diphthongs exists in modern languages, such as [[Scots language|Scots]], in which the short diphthong in ''tide'' {{IPA|/t\u0259id/}} contrasts with the long diphthong in ''tied'' {{IPA|/taid/}}.<ref name=\"diphthongs\" />\n\n[[Peter Schrijver]] has theorized that Old English breaking developed from language contact with Celtic. He says that two Celtic languages were spoken in Britain, Highland British Celtic, which was phonologically influenced by British [[Latin]] and developed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]], and Lowland British Celtic, which was brought to Ireland at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and became [[Old Irish]]. Lowland British Celtic had velarization like Old and [[Irish phonology#On- and off-glides|Modern Irish]], which gives preceding vowels a back offglide, and this feature was loaned by [[language contact]] into Old English, resulting in backing diphthongs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schrijver|2014|pp=87\u201392}}</ref>\n\n==Phonotactics==\n[[Phonotactics]] is the study of the sequences of phonemes that occur in languages and the sound structures that they form. In this study it is usual to represent consonants in general with the letter C and vowels with the letter V, so that a syllable such as 'be' is described as having CV structure. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol used to show a division between syllables is the dot {{IPA|[.]}}.  Old English stressed [[syllable]]s were structured as (C)<sup>3</sup>V(C)<sup>3<!-- it seems? --></sup>.\n\n===Onset===\n[[Syllable onset|Onset]] [[consonant cluster|clusters]] can be analyzed as having three \"slots\": the first can be occupied by [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/s, \u0283, f, \u03b8/}}, the second by [[Stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}, and the third by the [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/m, n, r, l, w/}}.<ref name=\"fisiak\"/> The other onset consonants {{IPA|/j, t\u0283, h, n\u0325, r\u0325, l\u0325, \u028d/}} (and {{IPA|/r\u02e0, \u026b/}} if these are accepted as existing) always occur alone. Alternatively, the voiceless sonorants {{IPA|[n\u0325, r\u0325, l\u0325, \u028d]}} can be analyzed as clusters of {{IPA|/h/}} and a voiced sonorant: {{IPA|/hn, hr, hl, hw/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Old English syllable-initial consonant clusters\n! rowspan=\"2\" | First<br>consonant !! rowspan=\"2\" | Middle<br>consonant !! colspan=\"6\" | Last<br>consonant\n|-\n! -\u2205\n! {{IPA|-m}}\n! {{IPA|-n}}\n! {{IPA|-r}}\n! {{IPA|-l}}\n! {{IPA|-w}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" | \u2205-\n! -\u2205-\n|\n| {{IPA|m}}\n| {{IPA|n}}\n| {{IPA|r}}\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|w}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-p-}}\n| {{IPA|p}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|pr}}\n| {{IPA|pl}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-b-}}\n| {{IPA|b}}\n| {{IPA|br}}\n| {{IPA|bl}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-t-}}\n| {{IPA|t}}\n| {{IPA|tr}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|tw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-d-}}\n| {{IPA|d}}\n| {{IPA|dr}}\n| {{IPA|dw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-k-}}\n| {{IPA|k}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|kn}}\n| {{IPA|kr}}\n| {{IPA|kl}}\n| {{IPA|kw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-\u0261-}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261n}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261r}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261l}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | {{IPA|s-}}\n! -\u2205-\n| {{IPA|s}}\n| {{IPA|sm}}\n| {{IPA|sn}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|sl}}\n| {{IPA|sw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-p-}}\n| {{IPA|sp}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|spr}}\n| {{IPA|spl}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-t-}}\n| {{IPA|st}}\n| {{IPA|str}}\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-k-}}\n| {{IPA|sk}}\n| {{IPA|skr}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|\u0283-}}\n! rowspan=\"4\" | -\u2205-\n| {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u0283r}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|f-}}\n| {{IPA|f}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|fn}}\n| {{IPA|fr}}\n| {{IPA|fl}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|\u03b8-}}\n| {{IPA|\u03b8}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u03b8r}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u03b8w}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|h-}}\n| {{IPA|h}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|n\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|r\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|l\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|\u028d}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Other\n| colspan=\"6\" | {{IPA|j, t\u0283, r\u02e0/wr, \u026b/wl}}\n|}\n\n===Nucleus===\nThe [[syllable nucleus]] was always a vowel.\n\n===Coda===\n\n== Sound changes ==\n{{Main|Phonological history of Old English}}\nLike [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], Old English underwent [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the velar consonants {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} and [[fronting (phonology)|fronting]] of the open vowel {{IPA|/\u0251 \u0251\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u00e6\u02d0/}} in certain cases. It also underwent vowel shifts that were not shared with Frisian: smoothing, diphthong height harmonization, and breaking. Diphthong height harmonization and breaking resulted in the unique Old English diphthongs {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|ie}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|ea}}.\n\nPalatalization yielded some Modern English word-pairs in which one word has a velar and the other has a palatal or postalveolar. Some of these were inherited from Old English (''drink'' and ''drench'', ''day'' and ''dawn''), while others have an unpalatalized form [[loanword|loaned]] from [[Old Norse]] ({{lang|ang|skirt}} and {{lang|ang|shirt}}).\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{anchor|Dialect differences}}\n{{hatnote|See also [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].}}\n[[Old English]] had four major [[dialect]] groups: [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]], [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]], [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]]. Kentish and West Saxon were the dialects spoken south of a line approximately following the course of the [[Thames|River Thames]]: Kentish in the easternmost portion of that area and West Saxon everywhere else. Mercian was spoken in the middle part of the country, separated from the southern dialects by the Thames and from Northumbrian by the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Mercian and Northumbrian are often grouped together as \"Anglian\".\n\nThe biggest differences occurred between West Saxon and the other groups.  The differences occurred mostly in the front vowels, and particularly the diphthongs. (However, Northumbrian was distinguished from the rest by much less [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Forms in Modern English with hard {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} where a palatalized sound would be expected from Old English are due either to Northumbrian influence or to direct borrowing from Scandinavian.  Note that, in fact, the lack of palatalization in Northumbrian was probably due to heavy Scandinavian influence.)\n\nThe early history of Kentish was similar to Anglian, but sometime around the ninth century all of the front vowels {{lang|ang|\u00e6}}, {{lang|ang|e}}, {{lang|ang|y}} (long and short) merged into {{lang|ang|e}} (long and short).  The further discussion concerns the differences between Anglian and West Saxon, with the understanding that Kentish, other than where noted, can be derived from Anglian by front-vowel merger.  The primary differences were:\n*Original (post [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]) {{lang|ang|\u01e3}} was raised to {{lang|ang|\u0113}} in Anglian but remained in West Saxon.  This occurred before other changes such as breaking, and did not affect {{lang|ang|\u01e3}} caused by i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|\u0101}}.  Hence, e.g., {{lang|ang|d\u01e3lan}} ('to divide') < {{PIE|''*dailijan''}} appears the same in both dialects, but West Saxon {{lang|ang|sl\u01e3pan}} ('to sleep') appears as ''sl\u0113pan'' in Anglian. (Note the corresponding vowel difference in the spelling of \"deal\" < {{lang|ang|d\u01e3lan}} vs. \"sleep\" < Anglian {{lang|ang|sl\u0113pan}}.)\n*The West Saxon vowels {{lang|ang|ie}}/{{lang|ang|\u012be}}, caused by i-umlaut of long and short {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|io}} did not appear in Anglian.  Instead, i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|ea}} and rare {{lang|ang|eo}} is spelled {{lang|ang|e}}, and i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|io}} remains as {{lang|ang|io}}.\n*Breaking of short {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to ''ea'' did not happen in Anglian before /l/+consonant; instead, the vowel was retracted to {{IPA|/\u0251/}}.  When mutated by i-umlaut, it appears again as {{lang|ang|\u00e6}} (vs. West Saxon {{lang|ang|ie}}).  Hence, Anglian {{lang|ang|cald}} ('cold') vs. West Saxon {{lang|ang|\u010beald}}.\n*Merger of {{lang|ang|eo}} and {{lang|ang|io}} (long and short) occurred early in West Saxon, but much later in Anglian.\n*Many instances of diphthongs in Anglian, including the majority of cases caused by breaking, were turned back into monophthongs again by the process of \"Anglian smoothing\", which occurred before {{lang|ang|c}}, {{lang|ang|h}}, {{lang|ang|g}}, alone or preceded by {{lang|ang|r}} or {{lang|ang|l}}.  This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences between standard (i.e. West Saxon) Old English and Modern English spelling.  E.g. {{lang|ang|\u0113age}} ('eye') became {{lang|ang|\u0113ge}} in Anglian; {{lang|ang|n\u0113ah}} ('near') became Anglian {{lang|ang|n\u0113h}}, later raised to {{lang|ang|n\u012bh}} in the transition to Middle English by raising of {{lang|ang|\u0113}} before {{lang|ang|h}} (hence {{lang|ang|nigh}} in Modern English); {{lang|ang|n\u0113ahst}} ('nearest') become Anglian {{lang|ang|n\u0113hst}}, shortened to {{lang|ang|nehst}} in late Old English by vowel-shortening before three consonants (hence ''next'' in Modern English).\n\nModern English derives mostly from the Anglian dialect rather than the standard West Saxon dialect of Old English.  However, since [[London]] sits on the Thames near the boundary of the Anglian, West Saxon, and Kentish dialects, some West Saxon and Kentish forms have entered Modern English.

Typically only {{IPA|/k, t\u0283, \u0261, j, \u0283, h/}} are analyzed as separate phonemes; {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} is considered an allophone of {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} allophones of {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\nHistorically, {{IPA|/t\u0283, \u0283/}} developed from {{IPA|/k, sk/}} by [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and some cases of {{IPA|/j/}} developed from palatalization of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, while others developed from Proto-Germanic {{PIE|*j}}. (Although this palatalization occurred as a regular sound change, later vowel changes and [[loan word|borrowings]] meant that the occurrence of the palatal forms was no longer predictable, that is, the palatals and the velars had become separate [[phoneme]]s.) Both the velars {{IPA|/k, \u0261/}} (including {{IPA|[\u0263]}}) and the palatals {{IPA|/t\u0283, j/}} (including {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}) are [[Old English orthography|spelled]] as {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|g}}}} in Old English manuscripts.\n\nIn modern texts, the palatalized versions may be written with a [[dot (diacritic)|dot above the letter]]: {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. (As just mentioned, it would otherwise not generally be possible to predict whether a palatal or velar is meant, although there are certain common patterns; for example, {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}} often has the palatalized sound before the front vowels {{vr|{{lang|ang|i}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|e}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|\u00e6}}}}. Note that Old English had palatalized {{vr|g}} in certain words that have [[hard G]] in Modern English due to [[Scandinavian influence on English|Old Norse influence]], such as {{lang|ang|\u0121iefan}} \"give\" and {{lang|ang|\u0121eat}} \"gate\".)\n\n{{IPA|/j/}} was pronounced as {{IPA|[j]}} in most cases, but as the affricate {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} after {{IPA|/n/}} or when [[gemination|geminated]] ([[fortition]]). The voiced velar stop {{IPA|/\u0261/}} was pronounced as a fricative {{IPA|[\u0263]}} after a vowel or [[liquid consonant|liquid]]. At the end of a word, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} was [[consonant voicing and devoicing|devoiced]] to an allophone of {{IPA|/h/}} (such as {{IPA|[x]}}; see below). Because of this, and the palatalization referred to above, the phonemes {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/h/}} [[alternation (linguistics)|alternate]] in the inflectional forms of some words.\n* {{lang|ang|n\u00e6\u0121l}} ('nail') {{IPA|/\u02c8n\u00e6jl/}}\n* {{lang|ang|d\u00e6\u0121}} ('day') {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u00e6j/}}\n: {{lang|ang|d\u00e6\u0121es}} ({{sc|gen.sg}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u00e6jes/}}\n: {{lang|ang|dagas}} ({{sc|nom.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u0261\u0251s/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0251\u0263\u0251s]}}\n: {{lang|ang|dagung}} ('dawn') {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u0261un\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0251\u0263u\u014b\u0261]}}\n* {{lang|ang|burg}}, {{lang|ang|burh}} ('castle') {{IPA|/bur\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[burx]}} (~ {{IPA|/burh/}})\n: {{lang|ang|burgum}} ({{sc|dat.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8bur\u0261um/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8bur\u0263um]}}\n: {{lang|ang|byri\u0121}} ({{sc|nom.pl}}) {{IPA|/\u02c8byrij/}}\n* {{lang|ang|sen\u0121an}} ('to singe') {{IPA|/\u02c8senjan/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8send\u0292\u0251n]}} (from {{PIE|*sangijan}})\n* {{lang|ang|bry\u010b\u0121}} ('bridge') {{IPA|/bryjj/}} > {{IPA|[brydd\u0292]}} (from {{PIE|*bruggj\u014d}} < {{PIE|*bru\u0263j\u014d}})\n\nIn [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] and probably early Old English, {{IPA|[\u0263]}} appeared in initial position as well, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}} was best considered an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0263/}}, occurring only after a [[nasal stop|nasal]] or when geminated. But after {{IPA|[\u0263]}} became {{IPA|[\u0261]}} word-initially in Old English, it makes sense to consider the [[stop consonant|stop]] the basic form and the [[fricative consonant|fricative]] the allophone.\n\n{{IPA|[\u00e7, x]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/h/}} occurring in [[syllable coda|coda]] position after front and back vowels respectively.\n* {{lang|ang|cniht}} ('boy') {{IPA|/kniht/}} > {{IPA|[kni\u00e7t]}}\n* {{lang|ang|\u0121e\u00fe\u014dht}} ('thought') {{IPA|/je\u02c8\u03b8o\u02d0ht/}} > {{IPA|[je\u02c8\u03b8o\u02d0xt]}}\n\nThe evidence for the allophone {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after front vowels is indirect, as it is not indicated in the orthography. Nevertheless, the fact that there was historically a fronting of {{PIE|*k}} to {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and of {{PIE|*\u0263}} to {{IPA|/j/}} after front vowels makes it very likely. Moreover, in late [[Middle English]], {{IPA|/h/}} sometimes became {{IPA|/f/}} (e.g. ''tough'', ''cough''), but only after back vowels, never after front vowels. This is explained if we assume that the allophone {{IPA|[x]}} sometimes became {{IPA|[f]}} but the allophone {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} never did.\n\n==== Sonorants ====\n{{IPA|[\u014b]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} occurring before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}. Words that have [[NG-coalescence|final {{IPA|/\u014b/}} in standard Modern English]] have the cluster {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261]}} in Old English.\n* {{lang|ang|sincan}} ('sink') {{IPA|/\u02c8sink\u0251n/}} > {{IPA|[\u02c8si\u014bk\u0251n]}}\n* {{lang|ang|hring}} ('ring') {{IPA|/hrin\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[r\u0325i\u014b\u0261]}}\n\nThe exact nature of Old English {{IPA|/r/}} is not known. It may have been an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in most Modern English accents, an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, or an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\nThe sequences {{IPA|/hw, hl, hn, hr/}} were pronounced as [[Sonorant#Voiceless|voiceless sonorants]] {{IPA|[\u028d, l\u0325, n\u0325, r\u0325]}}.

This is suggested by the vowel shifts of [[#Origin of diphthongs|breaking and retraction]] before {{IPA|/l r/}}, which could be cases of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following velar consonant:\n* {{lang|ang|*lirnian}} > {{lang|ang|liornian}} > {{lang|ang|leornian}} {{IPA|[\u02c8leo\u032fr\u02e0nian]}} ('learn')\n* {{lang|ang|*er\u00fee}} > {{lang|ang|eor\u00fee}} {{IPA|[\u02c8eo\u032fr\u02e0\u00f0e]}}\n* {{lang|ang|*f\u00e6llan}} > {{lang|ang|feallan}} {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u0251\u032f\u026b\u026b\u0251n]}} ('fall')\nDue to [[#Phonotactics|phonotactic constraints]] on initial clusters, \u27e8wr\u27e9 and \u27e8wl\u27e9 are thought by some to be [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] representing these velarized sounds, in which case the distinction was phonemic:<ref name=\"fisiak\">{{cite journal |last1=Fisiak |first1=Jacek |date=Jan 1967 |title= The Old English \u27e8wr-\u27e9 and \u27e8wl-\u27e9 |url= |journal=[[Linguistics (journal)|Linguistics]] |volume=5 |issue=32 |pages=12\u201314 |doi=10.1515/ling.1967.5.32.12 }}</ref>\n* {{lang|ang|\u01bfr\u012bdan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8r\u02e0i\u02d0d\u0251n]}} \"to grow\"\n* {{lang|ang|r\u012bdan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8ri\u02d0d\u0251n]}} \"to ride\"\n* {{lang|ang|\u01bfl\u012btan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8\u026bi\u02d0t\u0251n]}} \"to look\"\n* {{lang|ang|l\u012btan}}: {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0t\u0251n]}} \"to bend\"\n\nHowever, this theory is inconsistent with orthoepic evidence from the [[Early Modern English]] era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=27 January 2000 |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language Volume 3 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=CCvMbntWth8C |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=64 |isbn=9780521264761 |author-link=Roger Lass }}\n</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nOld English had a moderately large vowel system. In [[stress (linguistics)|stressed syllables]], both monophthongs and diphthongs had short and long versions, which were clearly distinguished in pronunciation. In unstressed syllables, vowels were [[vowel reduction|reduced]] or [[elision|elided]], though not as much as in Modern English.\n\n==== Monophthongs ====\nOld English had seven or eight [[Vowel#Quality|vowel qualities]], depending on [[Old English dialects|dialect]], and each could appear  as either a long or short [[monophthong]]. An example of a pair of words distinguished by vowel length is {{lang|ang|god}} {{IPA|[\u0261od]}} ('god') and {{lang|ang|g\u014dd}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u02d0d]}} ('good').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! <small>unrounded</small>\n! <small>[[rounded vowel|rounded]]</small>\n! <small>unrounded</small>\n! <small>rounded</small>\n|-\n!

This is suggested by the fact that the word for \"man\", for example, is spelled as {{lang|ang|mann}} or {{lang|ang|monn}}.<ref name=\"low vowels\" />\n\nIn unstressed syllables, only three vowels, {{IPA|/\u0251 e u/}}, were distinguished.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hogg|1992|pp=119\u2013122}}</ref> Here {{IPA|/\u00e6, e, i/}} were reduced to {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0251, o/}} were reduced to {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} remained. Unstressed {{IPA|/e, u/}} were sometimes pronounced as {{IPA|[i, o]}}, as in {{lang|ang|hali\u0121}} and {{lang|ang|heofon}}.\n\n==== Diphthongs ====\nAll dialects of Old English had [[diphthong]]s. Like monophthongs, diphthongs appear to have had [[vowel length|short and long]] versions. In modern texts, long diphthongs are marked with a macron on the first letter. The short versions behave like short monophthongs, and the long versions like long monophthongs. Most Old English diphthongs consist of a front vowel followed by a back offglide; according to some analyses they were in fact front vowels followed by a velarized consonant.<ref name=\"diphthongs\">{{Harvnb|Hogg|1992|pp=101\u2013105}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schrijver|2014|pp=87\u201391}}</ref> The diphthongs tend to be [[height-harmonic]], meaning that both parts of the diphthong had the same [[vowel height]] (high, mid or low).\n\nThe [[Anglian dialects]] had the following diphthongs:<ref name=\"diphthongs\" />\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!

Earlier West Saxon, however, had an additional pair of long and short diphthongs written {{lang|ang|ie}} (distinguished as {{lang|ang|ie}} and {{lang|ang|\u012be}} in modern editions), which developed from i-mutation or umlaut of {{lang|ang|eo}} or {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113o}} or {{lang|ang|\u0113a}}. Scholars do not agree on how they were pronounced; they may have been {{IPA|[ie\u032f i\u02d0e\u032f]}} or {{IPA|[iy\u032f i\u02d0y\u032f]}}. They were apparently monophothongized by [[Alfred the Great]]'s time, to a vowel whose pronunciation is still uncertain, but is known as \"unstable ''i''\". This later went on to merge with {{IPA|/y y\u02d0/}}, according to spellings such as {{lang|ang|gelyfan}}, for earlier {{lang|ang|geliefan}} and {{lang|ang|gelifan}} ('to believe').<ref>Quirk, R., Wreenn, C.L., ''An Old English Grammar'', Psychology Press, 1957, p. 140.</ref> (According to another interpretation, however, the \"unstable i\" may simply have been {{IPA|/i/}}, and the later {{IPA|/y/}} can be explained by the fact that Late West Saxon was not a direct descendant of Early West Saxon. See [[Old English dialects]].) This produced additional instances of {{IPA|/y(\u02d0)/}} alongside those that developed from [[Germanic umlaut#I-mutation in Old English|i-mutation]] and from sporadic rounding of {{IPA|/i(\u02d0)/}} in certain circumstances (e.g. {{lang|ang|my\u010bel}} 'much' from earlier {{lang|ang|mi\u010bel}}, with rounding perhaps triggered by the rounded {{IPA|/m/}}). All instances of {{IPA|/y(\u02d0)/}} were normally unrounded next to {{vr|{{lang|ang|c}}}}, {{vr|{{lang|ang|g}}}} and {{vr|{{lang|ang|h}}}}, hence {{lang|ang|gifan}} from earlier {{lang|ang|giefan}} 'to give'.\n\n==== Origin of diphthongs ====\n{{further|Phonological history of Old English}}\nOld English diphthongs have several origins, either from Proto-Germanic or from Old English vowel shifts. Long diphthongs developed partly from the Proto-Germanic diphthongs {{PIE|*iu, *eu, *au}} and partly from the Old English vowel shifts, while the short diphthongs developed only from Old English vowel shifts. These are examples of diphthongs inherited from Proto-Germanic:\n* PG {{PIE|*biun}} > Anglian {{lang|ang|b\u012bon}}, West Saxon {{lang|ang|b\u0113on}} 'be'\n* PG {{PIE|*deur}} > OE {{lang|ang|d\u0113or}} 'animal' > Modern English {{lang|ang|deer}}\n* PG {{PIE|*dau\u00fe}} > OE {{lang|ang|d\u0113a\u00fe}} 'death'\n\nThere are three vowel shifts that resulted in diphthongs: breaking, palatal diphthongization, and back mutation. Through breaking, Anglo-Frisian short {{PIE|*i, *e, *\u00e6}} developed into the short diphthongs {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|ea}} before {{IPA|/h, w/}} or a consonant cluster beginning with {{IPA|/r, l/}}, and Anglo-Frisian long {{PIE|*\u012b, *\u01e3}} developed into the diphthongs {{lang|ang|\u012bo}} and {{lang|ang|\u0113a}} before {{IPA|/h/}}. Palatal diphthongization changed {{lang|ang|e}}, {{lang|ang|\u00e6}} and {{lang|ang|a}}, {{lang|ang|\u01e3}}, {{lang|ang|u}} and {{lang|ang|o}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113}} to the diphthongs {{lang|ang|ie}}, {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113o}}, {{lang|ang|\u0113a}} respectively after the palatalized consonants {{lang|ang|\u0121}}, {{lang|ang|s\u010b}}, and {{lang|ang|\u010b}} (though this may have only been a spelling change). Back mutation changed {{lang|ang|i}}, {{lang|ang|e}}, and sometimes {{lang|ang|a}} to {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, and {{lang|ang|ea}} before a back vowel in the next syllable.\n* PG {{PIE|*lizn\u014djan\u0105}} > Anglo-Frisian {{PIE|*lirnian}} > Anglian {{lang|ang|liornian}}, West Saxon ''leornian'' 'learn' (breaking)\n* PG {{PIE|*n\u0101h}} > AF {{PIE|*n\u01e3h}} > Old English {{lang|ang|n\u0113ah}} 'near' (breaking)\n* PG {{PIE|*geban\u0105}} > AF {{PIE|*jefan}} > {{lang|ang|\u0121iefan}} 'give' (palatal diphthongization)\n* PG {{PIE|*sebun}} > AF {{PIE|*sefon}} > OE {{lang|ang|seofon}} 'seven' (back mutation)\n\nScholars disagree on whether short diphthongs are phonologically possible, and some say that Old English short diphthongs must actually have been centralized vowels. Hogg argues against this, saying that a length contrast in diphthongs exists in modern languages, such as [[Scots language|Scots]], in which the short diphthong in ''tide'' {{IPA|/t\u0259id/}} contrasts with the long diphthong in ''tied'' {{IPA|/taid/}}.<ref name=\"diphthongs\" />\n\n[[Peter Schrijver]] has theorized that Old English breaking developed from language contact with Celtic. He says that two Celtic languages were spoken in Britain, Highland British Celtic, which was phonologically influenced by British [[Latin]] and developed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]], and Lowland British Celtic, which was brought to Ireland at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and became [[Old Irish]]. Lowland British Celtic had velarization like Old and [[Irish phonology#On- and off-glides|Modern Irish]], which gives preceding vowels a back offglide, and this feature was loaned by [[language contact]] into Old English, resulting in backing diphthongs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schrijver|2014|pp=87\u201392}}</ref>\n\n==Phonotactics==\n[[Phonotactics]] is the study of the sequences of phonemes that occur in languages and the sound structures that they form. In this study it is usual to represent consonants in general with the letter C and vowels with the letter V, so that a syllable such as 'be' is described as having CV structure. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol used to show a division between syllables is the dot {{IPA|[.]}}.  Old English stressed [[syllable]]s were structured as (C)<sup>3</sup>V(C)<sup>3<!-- it seems? --></sup>.\n\n===Onset===\n[[Syllable onset|Onset]] [[consonant cluster|clusters]] can be analyzed as having three \"slots\": the first can be occupied by [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/s, \u0283, f, \u03b8/}}, the second by [[Stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}, and the third by the [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/m, n, r, l, w/}}.<ref name=\"fisiak\"/> The other onset consonants {{IPA|/j, t\u0283, h, n\u0325, r\u0325, l\u0325, \u028d/}} (and {{IPA|/r\u02e0, \u026b/}} if these are accepted as existing) always occur alone. Alternatively, the voiceless sonorants {{IPA|[n\u0325, r\u0325, l\u0325, \u028d]}} can be analyzed as clusters of {{IPA|/h/}} and a voiced sonorant: {{IPA|/hn, hr, hl, hw/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Old English syllable-initial consonant clusters\n! rowspan=\"2\" | First<br>consonant !! rowspan=\"2\" | Middle<br>consonant !! colspan=\"6\" | Last<br>consonant\n|-\n! -\u2205\n! {{IPA|-m}}\n! {{IPA|-n}}\n! {{IPA|-r}}\n! {{IPA|-l}}\n! {{IPA|-w}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" | \u2205-\n! -\u2205-\n|\n| {{IPA|m}}\n| {{IPA|n}}\n| {{IPA|r}}\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|w}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-p-}}\n| {{IPA|p}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|pr}}\n| {{IPA|pl}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-b-}}\n| {{IPA|b}}\n| {{IPA|br}}\n| {{IPA|bl}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-t-}}\n| {{IPA|t}}\n| {{IPA|tr}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|tw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-d-}}\n| {{IPA|d}}\n| {{IPA|dr}}\n| {{IPA|dw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-k-}}\n| {{IPA|k}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|kn}}\n| {{IPA|kr}}\n| {{IPA|kl}}\n| {{IPA|kw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-\u0261-}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261n}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261r}}\n| {{IPA|\u0261l}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | {{IPA|s-}}\n! -\u2205-\n| {{IPA|s}}\n| {{IPA|sm}}\n| {{IPA|sn}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|sl}}\n| {{IPA|sw}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|-p-}}\n| {{IPA|sp}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|spr}}\n| {{IPA|spl}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-t-}}\n| {{IPA|st}}\n| {{IPA|str}}\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|-k-}}\n| {{IPA|sk}}\n| {{IPA|skr}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|\u0283-}}\n! rowspan=\"4\" | -\u2205-\n| {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u0283r}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|f-}}\n| {{IPA|f}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|fn}}\n| {{IPA|fr}}\n| {{IPA|fl}}\n| \u2014\n|-\n! {{IPA|\u03b8-}}\n| {{IPA|\u03b8}}\n| colspan=\"2\" | \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u03b8r}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|\u03b8w}}\n|-\n! {{IPA|h-}}\n| {{IPA|h}}\n| \u2014\n| {{IPA|n\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|r\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|l\u0325}}\n| {{IPA|\u028d}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Other\n| colspan=\"6\" | {{IPA|j, t\u0283, r\u02e0/wr, \u026b/wl}}\n|}\n\n===Nucleus===\nThe [[syllable nucleus]] was always a vowel.\n\n===Coda===\n\n== Sound changes ==\n{{Main|Phonological history of Old English}}\nLike [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], Old English underwent [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the velar consonants {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} and [[fronting (phonology)|fronting]] of the open vowel {{IPA|/\u0251 \u0251\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u00e6\u02d0/}} in certain cases. It also underwent vowel shifts that were not shared with Frisian: smoothing, diphthong height harmonization, and breaking. Diphthong height harmonization and breaking resulted in the unique Old English diphthongs {{lang|ang|io}}, {{lang|ang|ie}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|ea}}.\n\nPalatalization yielded some Modern English word-pairs in which one word has a velar and the other has a palatal or postalveolar. Some of these were inherited from Old English (''drink'' and ''drench'', ''day'' and ''dawn''), while others have an unpalatalized form [[loanword|loaned]] from [[Old Norse]] ({{lang|ang|skirt}} and {{lang|ang|shirt}}).\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{anchor|Dialect differences}}\n{{hatnote|See also [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].}}\n[[Old English]] had four major [[dialect]] groups: [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]], [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]], [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]]. Kentish and West Saxon were the dialects spoken south of a line approximately following the course of the [[Thames|River Thames]]: Kentish in the easternmost portion of that area and West Saxon everywhere else. Mercian was spoken in the middle part of the country, separated from the southern dialects by the Thames and from Northumbrian by the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Mercian and Northumbrian are often grouped together as \"Anglian\".\n\nThe biggest differences occurred between West Saxon and the other groups.  The differences occurred mostly in the front vowels, and particularly the diphthongs. (However, Northumbrian was distinguished from the rest by much less [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Forms in Modern English with hard {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} where a palatalized sound would be expected from Old English are due either to Northumbrian influence or to direct borrowing from Scandinavian.  Note that, in fact, the lack of palatalization in Northumbrian was probably due to heavy Scandinavian influence.)\n\nThe early history of Kentish was similar to Anglian, but sometime around the ninth century all of the front vowels {{lang|ang|\u00e6}}, {{lang|ang|e}}, {{lang|ang|y}} (long and short) merged into {{lang|ang|e}} (long and short).  The further discussion concerns the differences between Anglian and West Saxon, with the understanding that Kentish, other than where noted, can be derived from Anglian by front-vowel merger.  The primary differences were:\n*Original (post [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]) {{lang|ang|\u01e3}} was raised to {{lang|ang|\u0113}} in Anglian but remained in West Saxon.  This occurred before other changes such as breaking, and did not affect {{lang|ang|\u01e3}} caused by i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|\u0101}}.  Hence, e.g., {{lang|ang|d\u01e3lan}} ('to divide') < {{PIE|''*dailijan''}} appears the same in both dialects, but West Saxon {{lang|ang|sl\u01e3pan}} ('to sleep') appears as ''sl\u0113pan'' in Anglian. (Note the corresponding vowel difference in the spelling of \"deal\" < {{lang|ang|d\u01e3lan}} vs. \"sleep\" < Anglian {{lang|ang|sl\u0113pan}}.)\n*The West Saxon vowels {{lang|ang|ie}}/{{lang|ang|\u012be}}, caused by i-umlaut of long and short {{lang|ang|ea}}, {{lang|ang|eo}}, {{lang|ang|io}} did not appear in Anglian.  Instead, i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|ea}} and rare {{lang|ang|eo}} is spelled {{lang|ang|e}}, and i-umlaut of {{lang|ang|io}} remains as {{lang|ang|io}}.\n*Breaking of short {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to ''ea'' did not happen in Anglian before /l/+consonant; instead, the vowel was retracted to {{IPA|/\u0251/}}.  When mutated by i-umlaut, it appears again as {{lang|ang|\u00e6}} (vs. West Saxon {{lang|ang|ie}}).  Hence, Anglian {{lang|ang|cald}} ('cold') vs. West Saxon {{lang|ang|\u010beald}}.\n*Merger of {{lang|ang|eo}} and {{lang|ang|io}} (long and short) occurred early in West Saxon, but much later in Anglian.\n*Many instances of diphthongs in Anglian, including the majority of cases caused by breaking, were turned back into monophthongs again by the process of \"Anglian smoothing\", which occurred before {{lang|ang|c}}, {{lang|ang|h}}, {{lang|ang|g}}, alone or preceded by {{lang|ang|r}} or {{lang|ang|l}}.  This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences between standard (i.e. West Saxon) Old English and Modern English spelling.  E.g. {{lang|ang|\u0113age}} ('eye') became {{lang|ang|\u0113ge}} in Anglian; {{lang|ang|n\u0113ah}} ('near') became Anglian {{lang|ang|n\u0113h}}, later raised to {{lang|ang|n\u012bh}} in the transition to Middle English by raising of {{lang|ang|\u0113}} before {{lang|ang|h}} (hence {{lang|ang|nigh}} in Modern English); {{lang|ang|n\u0113ahst}} ('nearest') become Anglian {{lang|ang|n\u0113hst}}, shortened to {{lang|ang|nehst}} in late Old English by vowel-shortening before three consonants (hence ''next'' in Modern English).\n\nModern English derives mostly from the Anglian dialect rather than the standard West Saxon dialect of Old English.  However, since [[London]] sits on the Thames near the boundary of the Anglian, West Saxon, and Kentish dialects, some West Saxon and Kentish forms have entered Modern English.  For example, ''bury'' has its spelling derived from West Saxon and its pronunciation from Kentish (see below).\n\n== Examples ==\nThe prologue to [[Beowulf]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|H\u01bf\u00e6t! \u01bf\u0113 G\u0101r-Dena in \u0121\u0113ar-dagum}}<br />{{IPA|[\u02c8\u028d\u00e6t we\u02d0 \u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0rden\u0251 in \u02c8j\u00e6\u02d0\u0251\u032frd\u0251\u0263um]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0113od-cyninga \u00ferym \u0121efr\u016bnon,}}<br />{{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8e\u02d0o\u032fdkyni\u014b\u0261\u0251 \u02c8\u03b8rym je\u02c8fru\u02d0non]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|h\u016b \u00f0\u0101 \u00e6\u00feelingas ellen fremedon.}}<br />{{IPA|[hu\u02d0 \u00f0\u0251\u02d0 \u02c8\u00e6\u00f0eli\u014b\u0261\u0251s \u02c8el\u02d0en \u02c8fremedon]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|Oft S\u010byld S\u010b\u0113fing s\u010bea\u00feena \u00fer\u0113atum,}}<br />{{IPA|[oft \u02c8\u0283yld \u02c8\u0283e\u02d0vi\u014b\u0261 \u02c8\u0283\u0251\u00f0en\u0251 \u02c8\u03b8r\u00e6\u02d0\u0251\u032ftum]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|monegum m\u01e3\u0121\u00feum meodo-setla oft\u0113ah.}}<br />{{IPA|[\u02c8mone\u0263um \u02c8m\u00e6\u02d0j\u00f0um \u02c8meo\u032fdosetl\u0251 of\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0\u0251\u032fx]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|E\u0121sode eorl, sy\u00f0\u00f0an \u01e3rest \u01bfear\u00f0}}<br />{{IPA|[\u02c8ejzode \u02c8eo\u032fr\u02e0\u026b \u02c8sy\u03b8\u02d0\u0251n \u02c8\u00e6\u02d0rest w\u00e6\u0251\u032fr\u02e0\u03b8]}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ang|f\u0113a-s\u010beaft funden;

He first played the [[piano]] at age three.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>  In high school he became interested in [[boxing]], mainly at his father's insistence, and returned to music only after breaking his nose several times and sustaining several other injuries.\n\nWeertz majored in piano at [[Drake University]] in Des Moines, where he began developing a style that was a fusion of jazz, classical and pop, but was expelled for playing \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" in the practice room in violation of the school's classical music only policy.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>  Weertz entered the [[United States Navy]] and served in [[World War II]]. While still in the Navy he won the middleweight boxing championship at his base in Idaho,<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> and earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from Idaho State College (now [[Idaho State University]]) in 1950. Afterward, Weertz re-enrolled at Drake, where he earned his master's degree in music in 1951. He then moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]],<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> where he studied jazz piano under [[Lennie Tristano]] and [[Teddy Wilson]].\n\nDuring 1951-1952 Weertz won two talent contests: \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and [[Dennis James]]' ''Chance of a Lifetime'' television program. David Kapp, the founder of [[Kapp Records]], heard him play at the Hotel Madison and was so impressed that he signed the pianist, giving him a professional name \"that would stand up anywhere\", \"Roger Williams\", after the [[Roger Williams (theologian)|founder]] of [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n \nIn 1955 Williams recorded \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]\", the only piano instrumental to reach #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Billboard Hot 100|popular music chart]].

''Billboard'' magazine ranks him as the top-selling piano recording artist in history, with 21 gold and platinum albums to his credit. Williams was known as the \"Pianist to the Presidents\", having played for nine US Presidential administrations, beginning with [[Harry S. Truman]] &ndash; who requested Bach and Ravel, then played his own version of the Chopin waltz.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> His last White House performance was in November 2008 for a luncheon hosted by First Lady [[Laura Bush]].\n\nOn his 75th birthday, Williams performed his first 12-hour piano marathon. He performed marathons at the Steinway Hall in New York City and the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan Presidential Libraries. Williams and Carter were born on the same date and celebrated their mutual 80th birthdays together at the Carter Center when Williams played his marathon there. Williams was a Steinway Artist and was awarded their \"Steinway Lifetime Achievement Award.\" His [[Steinway & Sons]] \"Roger Williams Limited Edition Gold Steinway\" piano was designed by Steinway in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Williams Gold|url=http://www.steinway.com/pianos/steinway/art-case/roger-williams/|work=Steinway & Sons Web Site|accessdate=October 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011092759/http://steinway.com/pianos/steinway/art-case/roger-williams/|archivedate=October 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> This grand piano was on tour for public display and entertainment during 2007\u20132008. In 2010, Williams was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.\n\nWilliams music was in movie soundtracks: [[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]] (1980), [[More Than a Miracle]] (1967), [[Untamed Heart]] Nature Boy (1993), [[Reckless (1995 film)|Reckless]] O Little Town of Bethlehem (1995), The 39th Annual Academy Awards (TV Special) (performer: [[Born Free]]\n\nWilliams developed his caring attitude for his public from a boyhood experience in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. After a piano concert by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], he waited for 45 minutes outside in cold weather to meet Paderewski. When the pianist finally appeared, it was to rush to a waiting automobile. Williams, who had waited, was upset.\n\n<blockquote>I didn't even get near enough to touch him or get an autograph.  It was then and there I resolved that if ever I became famous I would never disappoint anyone who wanted to talk to me.<ref>The Tiger, [[Clemson Agricultural College]] (Clemson, South Carolina), January 13, 1961, Volume LIV, Number 14, p. 1</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilliams claimed to know 10,000 songs by heart, and often took requests.  Of his talent, he said: \u201cI know I was given a gift, and once in a while I go to church and say, \u2018Hey, thanks.\u2019 I play my religion through my fingers.\u201d<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Williams among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilliams was married twice.  His first marriage produced three children.  Both marriages ended in divorce.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n\nIn March 2011 Williams posted on his website that he had [[pancreatic cancer]] and that his doctors had told him they could not remove the tumor until chemotherapy shrunk it to an operable size. He said that he did not plan on canceling any upcoming concerts. He wrote: \"What does it all mean? It means I'm in just one more fight \u2014 the fight for my life...

He first played the [[piano]] at age three.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>  In high school he became interested in [[boxing]], mainly at his father's insistence, and returned to music only after breaking his nose several times and sustaining several other injuries.\n\nWeertz majored in piano at [[Drake University]] in Des Moines, where he began developing a style that was a fusion of jazz, classical and pop, but was expelled for playing \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" in the practice room in violation of the school's classical music only policy.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>  Weertz entered the [[United States Navy]] and served in [[World War II]]. While still in the Navy he won the middleweight boxing championship at his base in Idaho,<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> and earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from Idaho State College (now [[Idaho State University]]) in 1950. Afterward, Weertz re-enrolled at Drake, where he earned his master's degree in music in 1951. He then moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]],<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> where he studied jazz piano under [[Lennie Tristano]] and [[Teddy Wilson]].\n\nDuring 1951-1952 Weertz won two talent contests: \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and [[Dennis James]]' ''Chance of a Lifetime'' television program. David Kapp, the founder of [[Kapp Records]], heard him play at the Hotel Madison and was so impressed that he signed the pianist, giving him a professional name \"that would stand up anywhere\", \"Roger Williams\", after the [[Roger Williams (theologian)|founder]] of [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n \nIn 1955 Williams recorded \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]\", the only piano instrumental to reach #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Billboard Hot 100|popular music chart]]. It sold over two million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/77 77\u201378] | isbn= 0-214-20512-6 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/77 }}</ref> In 1966 he had another [[Record chart|Top Ten]] hit with the song \"[[Born Free (song)|Born Free]]\" from the [[film|motion picture]] [[soundtrack]]. His other hits include \"[[Near You]]\",  \"[[Till (song)|Till]]\", \"[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)|The Impossible Dream]]\", \"[[Choucoune (song)|Yellow Bird]]\", \"[[Maria (1956 song)|Maria]]\", and \"The Theme from ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]''\" which was part of the film's music score. ''Billboard'' magazine ranks him as the top-selling piano recording artist in history, with 21 gold and platinum albums to his credit. Williams was known as the \"Pianist to the Presidents\", having played for nine US Presidential administrations, beginning with [[Harry S. Truman]] &ndash; who requested Bach and Ravel, then played his own version of the Chopin waltz.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/> His last White House performance was in November 2008 for a luncheon hosted by First Lady [[Laura Bush]].\n\nOn his 75th birthday, Williams performed his first 12-hour piano marathon. He performed marathons at the Steinway Hall in New York City and the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan Presidential Libraries. Williams and Carter were born on the same date and celebrated their mutual 80th birthdays together at the Carter Center when Williams played his marathon there. Williams was a Steinway Artist and was awarded their \"Steinway Lifetime Achievement Award.\" His [[Steinway & Sons]] \"Roger Williams Limited Edition Gold Steinway\" piano was designed by Steinway in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Williams Gold|url=http://www.steinway.com/pianos/steinway/art-case/roger-williams/|work=Steinway & Sons Web Site|accessdate=October 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011092759/http://steinway.com/pianos/steinway/art-case/roger-williams/|archivedate=October 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> This grand piano was on tour for public display and entertainment during 2007\u20132008. In 2010, Williams was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.\n\nWilliams music was in movie soundtracks: [[Somewhere in Time]] (1980), [[More Than a Miracle]] (1967), [[Untamed Heart]] Nature Boy (1993), [[Reckless]] O Little Town of Bethlehem (1995), The 39th Annual Academy Awards (TV Special) (performer: [[Born Free]]\n\nWilliams developed his caring attitude for his public from a boyhood experience in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. After a piano concert by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], he waited for 45 minutes outside in cold weather to meet Paderewski. When the pianist finally appeared, it was to rush to a waiting automobile. Williams, who had waited, was upset.\n\n<blockquote>I didn't even get near enough to touch him or get an autograph.  It was then and there I resolved that if ever I became famous I would never disappoint anyone who wanted to talk to me.<ref>The Tiger, [[Clemson Agricultural College]] (Clemson, South Carolina), January 13, 1961, Volume LIV, Number 14, p. 1</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilliams claimed to know 10,000 songs by heart, and often took requests.  Of his talent, he said: \u201cI know I was given a gift, and once in a while I go to church and say, \u2018Hey, thanks.\u2019 I play my religion through my fingers.\u201d<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Williams among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilliams was married twice.  His first marriage produced three children.  Both marriages ended in divorce.<ref name=\"latimesobit\"/>\n\nIn March 2011 Williams posted on his website that he had [[pancreatic cancer]] and that his doctors had told him they could not remove the tumor until chemotherapy shrunk it to an operable size. He said that he did not plan on canceling any upcoming concerts. He wrote: \"What does it all mean? It means I'm in just one more fight \u2014 the fight for my life... And this much I know, this old Navy boxing champion is going for broke.

Described as the \"saviour of mothers\",{{sfn|Semmelweis Society International}} Semmelweis discovered that the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[puerperal fever]] (also known as \"childbed fever\") could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in [[Obstetrics|obstetrical]] clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal. Semmelweis proposed the practice of [[hand washing|washing hands]] with [[calcium hypochlorite|chlorinated lime solutions]] in 1847 while working in [[Vienna General Hospital]]'s First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of [[Midwifery|midwives']] wards.{{sfn|Hanninen|Farago|Monos|1983}} He published a book of his findings in ''[[Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever]]''.\n\nDespite various publications of results where hand washing reduced [[Death|mortality]] to below 1%, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis supposedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] by his colleague. He died a mere 14 days later, at the age of 47, after being beaten by the guards, from a gangrenous wound on his right hand which might have been caused by the beating. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when [[Louis Pasteur]] confirmed the [[germ theory of disease|germ theory]], and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], acting on the French [[microbiologist]]'s research, practised and operated using hygienic methods, with great success.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis parents.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=At left, a painted portrait of a woman in a black dress with a frilled hood and ruffled collar.

He was the fifth child out of ten of the prosperous [[grocer]] family of J\u00f3zsef Semmelweis and Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller.\n\nOf [[Germans of Hungary|German]] ancestry, his father was an ethnic German (''hienc'', stem from {{illm|Heanzenland|de|display=1}}, a German term for the historical Western-Hungary) born in [[Eisenstadt|Kismarton]], then part of Hungary, now [[Eisenstadt]], Austria. He achieved permission to set up a shop in Buda in 1806{{efn-ua|Translated from: [er] erhielt 1806 das B\u00fcrgerrecht in Buda{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}}} and, in the same year, opened a wholesale business for spices and general consumer goods.{{efn-ua|Translated from: Spezereien- und Kolonialwarengro\u00dfhandlung{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}}} The company was named ''zum Wei\u00dfen Elefanten'' (at the White Elephant) in Meindl-Haus in [[Tab\u00e1n]] (today's 1-3, Apr\u00f3d Street, Semmelweis Museum of Medical History).{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}} By 1810, he was a wealthy man and married Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller, daughter of the coach (vehicle) builder F\u00fcl\u00f6p M\u00fcller.{{sfn|Antall|Szebell\u00e9dy|1973}}\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis began studying law at the [[University of Vienna]] in the autumn of 1837, but by the following year, for reasons that are no longer known, he had switched to medicine. He was awarded his doctor of medicine degree in 1844. Later, after failing to obtain an appointment in a clinic for internal medicine, Semmelweis decided to specialize in obstetrics.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=16}} His teachers included [[Carl von Rokitansky]], [[Joseph \u0160koda]] and [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand von Hebra]].\n\n==Work on cause of childbed fever mortality==\n===Position at Vienna General Hospital===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}<!--most of the text beneath the table has no citations-->\n[[File:Semmelweis statue.jpg|thumb|Semmelweis statue at the [[University of Tehran]]]]\nSemmelweis was appointed assistant to Professor [[Johann Klein]] in the First Obstetrical Clinic of the [[Vienna General Hospital]] on July 1, 1846.{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=72}}{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=34|2a1=Schmidt|2y=1850|2p=501}}{{efn-ua|Details: On July 1, 1844 Semmelweis became a trainee physician's assistant at the Vienna maternity clinic (in German, ''Aspirant Assistentarztes an der Wiener Geburtshilflichen Klinik'') and on July 1, 1846 he was appointed an ordinary physician's assistant (in German, ''ordentlicher Assistentarzt''). However, on 20 October 1846 his predecessor Dr. [[Franz Breit (obstetrician)|Franz Breit]] (an obstetrician) unexpectedly returned, and Semmelweis was demoted. By March 20, 1847, Dr. Breit was appointed professor in [[T\u00fcbingen]] and Semmelweis resumed the ''Assistentarzt'' position.{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=72}}}} A comparable position today in a United States hospital would be \"chief resident.\"{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=56}} His duties were to examine patients each morning in preparation for the professor's rounds, supervise difficult deliveries, teach students of obstetrics and be \"clerk\" of records.\n\nMaternity institutions were set up all over Europe to address problems of [[infanticide]] of illegitimate children. They were set up as ''gratis'' institutions and offered to care for the infants, which made them attractive to [[underprivileged]] women, including prostitutes. In return for the free services, the women would be subjects for the training of doctors and midwives.\n\nTwo maternity clinics were at the Viennese hospital. The First Clinic had an average [[Maternal bond|maternal]] [[mortality rate]] of about 10% due to puerperal fever. The Second Clinic's rate was considerably lower, averaging less than 4%. This fact was known outside the hospital. The two clinics admitted on alternate days, but women begged to be admitted to the Second Clinic, due to the bad reputation of the First Clinic.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=69}} Semmelweis described desperate women begging on their knees not to be admitted to the First Clinic.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=70}} Some women even preferred to give birth in the streets, pretending to have given sudden birth ''en route'' to the hospital (a practice known as street births), which meant they would still qualify for the child care benefits without having been admitted to the clinic. Semmelweis was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare among women giving street births. \"To me, it appeared logical that patients who experienced street births would become ill at least as frequently as those who delivered in the clinic. [...] What protected those who delivered outside the clinic from these destructive unknown endemic influences?\"{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=81}}\n\n===Analysis of childbed fever mortality===\n\nSemmelweis was severely troubled that his First Clinic had a much higher mortality rate due to puerperal fever than the Second Clinic. It \"made me so miserable that life seemed worthless\".{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=86}} The two clinics used almost the same techniques, and Semmelweis started eliminating all possible differences, including even religious practices. The only major difference was the individuals who worked there. The First Clinic was the teaching service for medical students, while the Second Clinic had been selected in 1841 for the instruction of midwives only.\n\n[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1841-1846 two clinics.png|thumb|right|500px|[[Puerperal fever]] mortality rates for the First and Second Clinics at the Vienna General Hospital 1841\u20131846: The First Clinic has the higher mortality rate.]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"<!--generated with [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]] V1.7-->\n|+ [[Puerperal fever]] mortality rates for the First and Second Clinic at the Vienna General Hospital 1841\u20131846.

He eliminated climate as a cause because the climate was the same.\n\n===Theory of cadaverous poisoning===\n\nSemmelweis' breakthrough occurred in 1847, following the death of his good friend [[Jakob Kolletschka]], who had been accidentally poked with a student's scalpel while performing a [[Autopsy|''post mortem'' examination]]. Kolletschka's own autopsy showed a [[pathology]] similar to that of the women who were dying from puerperal fever. Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between [[cadaver]]ic contamination and puerperal fever.{{sfn|Lane|2010}}\n\nHe proposed that he and the medical students carried \"cadaverous particles\" on their hands{{efn-ua|Semmelweis's reference to \"cadaverous particles\" were (in German) \"''an der Hand klebende Cadavertheile''\"{{sfn|Benedek|1983|page=95}}}} from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic. This explained why the student [[Midwife|midwives]] in the Second Clinic, who were not engaged in autopsies and had no contact with corpses, saw a much lower mortality rate.\n\nThe [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been accepted in Vienna. Thus, Semmelweis concluded some unknown \"cadaverous material\" caused childbed fever. He instituted a policy of using a solution of chlorinated lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) for washing hands between autopsy work and the examination of patients. He did this because he found that this chlorinated solution worked best to remove the putrid smell of infected autopsy tissue, and thus perhaps destroyed the causal \"poisonous\" or contaminating \"cadaveric\" agent hypothetically being transmitted by this material.\n\nThe result was the mortality rate in the First Clinic declined 90%, and was then comparable to that in the Second Clinic. The mortality rate in April 1847 was 18.3%. After [[hand washing]] was instituted in mid-May, the rates in June were 2.2%, July 1.2%, August 1.9% and, for the first time since the introduction of anatomical orientation, the death rate was zero in two months in the year following this discovery.\n\n==Efforts to reduce childbed fever==\nSemmelweis's hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.\n\nSemmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European obstetricians, at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly twenty years after his breakthrough, he was committed to the ''Landesirrenanstalt [[D\u00f6bling]]'' (provincial lunatic asylum). He died there of [[Sepsis|septic shock]] only 14 days later, possibly as the result of being severely beaten by guards. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur further developed the germ theory of disease, offering a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis's findings. He is considered a pioneer of antiseptic procedures.\n\n===Conflict with established medical opinion===\n{{Main|Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis}}\n[[File:Monthly mortality rates 1841-1849.png|thumb|500px|[[Puerperal fever]] monthly mortality rates for the First Clinic at Vienna Maternity Institution 1841\u20131849. Rates drop markedly when Semmelweis implemented chlorine [[hand washing]] mid-May 1847 [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Monthly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1841\u20131849|(see rates)]].]]\n\nSemmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time. The theory of diseases was highly influenced by ideas of an imbalance of the basic \"[[Humorism|four humours]]\" in the body, a theory known as [[dyscrasia]], for which the main treatment was [[bloodletting]]s. Medical texts at the time emphasized that each case of disease was unique, the result of a personal imbalance, and the main difficulty of the medical profession was to establish precisely each patient's unique situation, case by case.\n\nThe findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of physical signs, which emphasized the belief that puerperal fever was not one, but many different, yet unidentified, diseases.\n\nThe rejection of Semmelweis's empirical observations is often traced to [[belief perseverance]], the psychological tendency of clinging to discredited beliefs. Also, some historians of science{{sfn|Nissani|1995|pp=165\u2013183}} argue that resistance to path-breaking contributions of obscure scientists is common and \"constitutes the single most formidable block to scientific advances.\"\n\nAs a result, his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Other, more subtle, factors may also have played a role. Some doctors, for instance, were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands, feeling that their social status as gentlemen was inconsistent with the idea that their hands could be unclean.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=9}}{{efn-ua|See for instance [[Charles Delucena Meigs]], in which there is a link to an original source document.}}\n\nSemmelweis's results lacked scientific explanation at the time. That became possible only some decades later, when [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Joseph Lister]], and others further developed the germ theory of disease.\n\nDuring 1848, Semmelweis widened the scope of his washing protocol, to include all instruments coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates [[time series]] to document his success in virtually eliminating puerperal fever from the hospital ward.\n\n===Hesitant publication of results and first signs of trouble===\n[[File:Streptococcus pyogenes.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (red-stained spheres) is responsible for most cases of severe [[puerperal fever]]. It is commonly found in the throat and [[nasopharynx]] of otherwise healthy carriers.]]\nToward the end of 1847, accounts of the work of Semmelweis (as well as the similar conclusions of Holmes, working in America){{sfn|Lane|2010}} began to spread around Europe. Semmelweis and his students wrote letters to the directors of several prominent maternity clinics describing their recent observations. [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand von Hebra]], the editor of a leading Austrian medical journal, announced Semmelweis's discovery in the December 1847{{sfn|Hebra|1847}} and April 1848{{sfn|Hebra|1848}} issues of the medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis's work had a practical significance comparable to that of [[Edward Jenner]]'s introduction of cowpox inoculations to prevent smallpox.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=54\u201355}}\n\nIn late 1848, one of Semmelweis's former students wrote a lecture explaining Semmelweis's work. The lecture was presented before the Royal Medical and Surgical Society in London and a review published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', a prominent medical journal.{{efn-ua|The author of the lecture was Charles Henry Felix Routh, but it was delivered by Edward William Murphy since Routh was not a Fellow of the Royal Medical and Surgical Society. (Lecture: ''On the Causes of the Endemic Puerperal Fever of Vienna'', Medico-chirurgical Transactions 32(1849): 27\u201340. Review: Lancet 2(1848): 642f.) For a list of some other reviews, see Frank P. Murphy, \"Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (1818\u20131865): An Annotated Bibliography,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 20 (1946), 653\u2013707: 654f.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=175}}}} A few months later, another of Semmelweis's former students published a similar essay in a French periodical.{{sfn|Wieger|1849}}\n\nAs accounts of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine washings would be widely adopted, saving tens of thousands of lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. [[James Young Simpson]], for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis's groundbreaking findings and the idea presented in an 1843 paper by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]{{sfn|Holmes|1843}} that childbed fever was contagious (''i.e''. that infected persons could pass the infection to others).{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=10\u201312}} Indeed, initial responses to Semmelweis's findings were that ''he had said nothing new''.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=31}}\n\nIn fact, Semmelweis was warning against all decaying organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of childbed fever themselves. This misunderstanding, and others like it, occurred partly because Semmelweis's work was known only through secondhand reports written by his colleagues and students. At this crucial stage, Semmelweis himself had published nothing. These and similar misinterpretations continued to cloud discussions of his work throughout the century.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=56}}\n\nSome accounts emphasize that Semmelweis refused to communicate his method officially to the learned circles of Vienna,{{sfn|Reid|1975|p=37}} nor was he eager to explain it on paper.\n\n===Political turmoil and dismissal from the Vienna hospital===\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|a series of tumultuous revolutions]] swept across Europe. The resulting political turmoil would affect Semmelweis's career. In Vienna on 13 March 1848 students demonstrated in favor of increased [[civil rights]], including trial by jury and [[freedom of expression]]. The demonstrations were led by medical students and young faculty members and were joined by workers from the suburbs. Two days later in Hungary, demonstrations and uprisings led to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and a full-scale war against the ruling [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] of the [[Austrian Empire]]. In Vienna, the March demonstration was followed by months of general unrest.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=57}}\n\nNo evidence indicates Semmelweis was personally involved in the events of 1848. Some of his brothers were punished for active participation in the Hungarian independence movement, and the Hungarian-born Semmelweis likely was sympathetic to the cause. Semmelweis's superior, professor [[Johann Klein]], was a conservative Austrian, likely uneasy with the independence movements and alarmed by the other [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas]]. Klein probably mistrusted Semmelweis.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=59}}\n\nWhen Semmelweis's term was about to expire, [[Carl Braun (obstetrician)|Carl Braun]] also applied for the position of \"assistant\" in the First Clinic, possibly at Klein's own invitation. Semmelweis and Braun were the only two applicants for the post. Semmelweis's predecessor, [[Franz Breit (obstetrician)|Franz Breit]], had been granted a two-year extension.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=61, 105}} Semmelweis's application for an extension was supported by [[Joseph \u0160koda]] and [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky|Carl von Rokitansky]] and by most of the medical faculty, but Klein chose Braun for the position. Semmelweis was obliged to leave the obstetrical clinic when his term expired on March 20, 1849.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=61}}\n\nThe day his term expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese authorities to be made [[Privatdozent|docent]] of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but had to wait until 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=105}} The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated [[mannequin]]s only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying good-bye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that might have offended them.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=52}} According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was \"unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment\".{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Life in Budapest===\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1857 Wedding picture.jpg|thumb|left|alt=At left, a painting of a balding, mustachioed middle-aged man in black-tie formal attire standing beside a red table.

Semmelweis, upon arriving from the Habsburg Vienna in 1850, likely was not warmly welcomed in Pest.\n\nOn 20 May 1851, Semmelweis took the relatively insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician position of the obstetric ward of Pest's small [[Saint Roch|Szent R\u00f3kus]] Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|p=107|2a1=Carter|2a2=Carter|2y=2005|2p=68}} Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851\u20131855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=106\u2013108}}\n\nDespite the impressive results, Semmelweis's ideas were not accepted by the other obstetricians in Budapest.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}} The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, [[Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly]], never adopted Semmelweis's methods. He continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=24}} Therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.\n\nAfter Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis applied for the position. So did Carl Braun\u2014Semmelweis's nemesis and successor as [[Johann Klein]]'s assistant in Vienna\u2014and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled the wishes of the Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor of obstetrics, Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest [[maternity clinic]]. Once again, the results were impressive.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}}\n\nSemmelweis declined an offer in 1857 to become professor of obstetrics at the [[University of Zurich]].{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=56}} The same year, Semmelweis married M\u00e1ria Weidenhofer (1837\u20131910), 19 years his junior and the daughter of a successful merchant in Pest. They had five children.\n\n===Response by the medical community===\n{{Main|Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|}}\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1861 Etiology front page.jpg|thumb|right|Semmelweis's main work: ''Die \u00c4tiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers'', 1861 (front page)]]\n[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|500px|In his 1861 book, Semmelweis presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in Wien (Vienna) in 1823 (vertical line) was accompanied by the increased incidence of fatal childbed fever.

Rates for the Dublin [[Rotunda Hospital|Rotunda maternity hospital]], which had no pathological anatomy, are shown for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784\u20131849|view rates]]).]]\nSemmelweis's views were much more favorably received in the [[United Kingdom]] than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood. The British consistently regarded Semmelweis as having supported their theory of contagion. A typical example was W. Tyler Smith, who claimed that Semmelweis \"made out very conclusively\" that \"[[Homeopathy|miasms]] derived from the dissecting room will excite puerperal disease.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=176|2a1=Tyler Smith|2y=1856|2p=504}} One of the first to respond to Semmelweis's 1848 communications was [[James Young Simpson]], who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis would have known that the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=174}}\n\nIn 1856, Semmelweis's assistant Josef Fleischer reported the successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity institutions in the'' Viennese Medical Weekly ''(''[[Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift]]'').{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}} The editor remarked sarcastically that it was time people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=24|2a1=Fleischer|2y=1856|2p=536}} Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled \"The Etiology of Childbed Fever\".{{efn-ua|The report was \"''A gyermek\u00e1gyi l\u00e1z k\u00f3roktana''\" (\"The Etiology of Childbed Fever\") published in ''Orvosi hetilap'' '''2''' (1858); a translation into German is included in Tiberius von Gy\u00f6ry's, ''Semmelweis's gesammelte Werke'' (Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1905), 61\u201383. This was Semmelweis's first publication on the subject of puerperal fever. According to Gy\u0151ry, the substance of the report was contained in lectures delivered before the ''Budapester K\u00f6nigliche \u00c2rzteverein'' in the spring of 1858.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=112}}}} Two years after that, he published a second essay, \"The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever\".{{efn-ua|The article was originally published as: Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, \"A gyermek\u00e1gyi l\u00e1z f\u00f6l\u00f6tti v\u00e9lem\u00e9nyk\u00fcl\u00f6nbs\u00e9g k\u00f6ztem s az angol orvosok k\u00f6zt\" Orvosi hetilap '''4''' (1860), 849\u2013851, 873\u2013876, 889\u2013893, 913\u2013915.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=24}}}} In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work ''Die \u00c4tiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers'' (German for \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\"){{efn-ua|[http://real-eod.mtak.hu/2450/ Digital copy of Semmelweis' book]}}. In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: \"Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at W\u00fcrzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected\".{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=169}}{{efn-ua|The monograph to which Semmelweis refers was a work by Heinrich Silberschmidt, \"Historisch-kritische Darstellung der Pathologie des Kindbettfiebers von den \u00e4ltesten Zeiten bis auf die unserige\", published 1859 in [[Erlangen]], which mentions Semmelweis only incidentally and without dealing at all with the transfer of toxic materials by the hands of physicians and midwives. The book was awarded a prize by the medical faculty of W\u00fcrzburg at the instigation of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels]]{{sfnm|1a1=Hauzman|1y=2006|2a1=Semmelweis|2y=1983|2p=212}}}}\n\nIn a textbook, Carl Braun, Semmelweis's successor as assistant in the first clinic, identified 30 causes of childbed fever; only the 28th of these was cadaverous infection. Other causes included conception and pregnancy, uremia, pressure exerted on adjacent organs by the shrinking uterus, emotional traumata, mistakes in diet, chilling, and atmospheric epidemic influences.{{sfn|Braun|1857}}{{efn-ua|Carl Braun's thirty causes appear in his ''Lehrbuch der Geburtsh\u00fclfe''. In the first of these, published in 1855, he mentions Semmelweis in connection with his discussion of cause number 28, cadaverous poisoning. In the later version, however, although he discusses the same cause in the same terms, all references to Semmelweis have been dropped.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=34*}}}}\n\nDespite this opposition, Braun, who was Assistant in the First Division in the period April 1849 to Summer 1853, maintained a relatively low mortality rate in the First Division, roughly consistent with the rate Semmelweis himself achieved, as [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Mortality rates at the Vienna General Hospital#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1833-1858 for first and second clinics|mortality rates]] in the period April 1849 to end 1853 show. These results suggest that Braun continued, assiduously, to require the chlorine washings.\n\nAt a conference of German physicians and [[natural scientist]]s, most of the speakers rejected his doctrine, including the celebrated [[Rudolf Virchow]], who was a scientist of the highest authority of his time. Virchow's great authority in medical circles contributed potently to Semmelweis' lack of recognition.{{sfn|Hauzman|2006}} [[Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly]], Semmelweis's predecessor as Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Pest, never accepted Semmelweis's teachings; he continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=4}} [[August Breisky]], an obstetrician in Prague, rejected Semmelweis's book as \"na\u00efve\" and he referred to it as \"the Koran of puerperal theology\". Breisky objected that Semmelweis had not proved that puerperal fever and [[pyemia]] are identical, and he insisted that other factors beyond decaying organic matter certainly had to be included in the [[etiology]] of the disease.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=41|2a1=Breisky|2y=1861|2p=1}} [[Carl Edvard Marius Levy]], head of the Copenhagen maternity hospital and an outspoken critic of Semmelweis's ideas, had reservations concerning the unspecific nature of cadaverous particles and that the supposed quantities were unreasonably small.{{sfnm|Semmelweis|1983|pp=180\u2013181|Levy|1848}} In fact, [[Robert Koch]] later used precisely this fact to prove that various infecting materials contained living organisms which could reproduce in the human body; that is, since the poison could be neither chemical nor physical in operation, it must be biological.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=183}}\n\nIt has been contended that Semmelweis could have had an even greater impact if he had managed to communicate his findings more effectively and avoid antagonising the medical establishment, even given the opposition from entrenched viewpoints.{{sfn|Nuland|2003}}\n\n==Breakdown and death==\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1862 Open letter.jpg|thumb|left|Semmelweis's 1862 ''Open Letter to all Professors of Obstetrics'']]\nBeginning in 1861, Semmelweis suffered from various nervous complaints. He suffered from severe depression and became absentminded. Paintings from 1857 to 1864 show a progression of aging.{{efn-ua|Paintings of Semmelweis available in the 1983 edition of his ''Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever'',{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=57}} and at [[Commons:Category:Ignaz Semmelweis|Wikimedia Commons]].}} He turned every conversation to the topic of childbed fever.\n\nAfter a number of unfavorable foreign reviews of his 1861 book, Semmelweis lashed out against his critics in a series of Open Letters.{{efn-ua|The 1862 open letter is available at the  {{URL|1=http://www.literature.at/viewer.alo?viewmode=overview&objid=13184&page= |2=Austrian national library}} website.}} They were addressed to various prominent European obstetricians, including [[Joseph Sp\u00e4th|Sp\u00e4th]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels|Scanzoni]], [[Eduard Caspar Jacob von Siebold|Siebold]], and to \"all obstetricians\". They were full of bitterness, desperation, and fury and were \"highly polemical and superlatively offensive\",{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=57}} at times denouncing his critics as irresponsible murderers{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=73}} or ignoramuses.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=41}} He also called upon Siebold to arrange a meeting of German obstetricians somewhere in Germany to provide a forum for discussions on puerperal fever, where he would stay \"until all have been converted to his theory.\"{{sfn|Hauzman|2006}}\n\nIn mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes in the company of a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=74}}\n\nThe exact nature of Semmelweis's affliction has been a subject of some debate. According to K Codell Carter, in his biography of Semmelweis, the exact nature of his affliction cannot be determined:<blockquote>It is impossible to appraise the nature of Semmelweis's disorder. ... It might have been [[Alzheimer's disease]], a type of dementia, which is associated with rapid cognitive decline and mood changes.{{sfn|Nuland|2003|p=270}} It might have been third-stage [[syphilis]], a then-common disease of obstetricians who examined thousands of women at gratis institutions, or it might have been emotional exhaustion from overwork and stress.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=75}}</blockquote>In 1865, [[J\u00e1nos Balassa]] wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution. On July 30, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra lured him, under the pretense of visiting one of Hebra's \"new Institutes\", to a Viennese insane asylum located in Lazarettgasse (''Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse'').{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=293}} Semmelweis surmised what was happening and tried to leave. He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a [[straitjacket]], and confined to a darkened cell. Apart from the straitjacket, treatments at the [[mental institution]] included dousing with cold water and administering [[castor oil]], a [[laxative]]. He died after two weeks, on August 13, 1865, aged 47, from a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] wound, due to an infection on his right hand which might have been caused by the struggle. The autopsy gave the cause of death as [[pyemia]]\u2014[[blood poisoning]].{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=76\u201378}}\n\nSemmelweis was buried in Vienna on August 15, 1865. Only a few people attended the service.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=78}} Brief announcements of his death appeared in a few medical periodicals in Vienna and Budapest. Although the rules of the Hungarian Association of Physicians and Natural Scientists specified that a commemorative address be delivered in honor of a member who had died in the preceding year, there was no address for Semmelweis; his death was never even mentioned.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=79}}\n\nJ\u00e1nos Diescher was appointed Semmelweis's successor at the Pest University maternity clinic. Immediately, mortality rates increased sixfold to 6%, but the physicians of Budapest said nothing; there were no inquiries and no protests. Almost no one\u2014either in Vienna or in Budapest\u2014seems to have been willing to acknowledge Semmelweis's life and work.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=79}}\n\nHis remains were transferred to Budapest in 1891. On 11 October 1964, they were transferred once more to the house in which he was born. The house{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}} is now a historical museum and library, honoring Ignaz Semmelweis.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=58}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:50 EURO Gold Coin - Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis - Austria.jpg|thumb|right|alt=At left, the obverse of a golden coin depicts a bust of Semmelweis as an old man, accompanied by the rod of Asclepius; it bears the inscription \"IGNAZ PHILLIP SEMMELWEIS 1818 1865 50 EURO 2008 REPUBLIK \u00d6STERREICH\".

Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared quite willing to experiment with the practical [[hand washing]] measures that he proposed\u2014although virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking theoretical innovation: that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=48}} [[Gustav Adolf Michaelis]], a professor at a maternity institution in [[Kiel]], replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions, but eventually committed suicide, feeling responsible for the death of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=176\u2013178}}\n\nOnly belatedly did his observational evidence gain wide acceptance; more than twenty years later, [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work offered a ''theoretical'' explanation for Semmelweis' observations: the germ theory of disease. As such, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with [[epistemology]] content, e.g. philosophy of science courses\u2014demonstrating the virtues of [[empiricism]] or [[positivism]] and providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not. It has been seen as an irony that Semmelweis' critics considered themselves positivists, but even positivism suffers problems in the face of theories which seem magical or superstitious, such as the idea that \"corpse particles\" might turn a person into a corpse, with no causal mechanism being stipulated, after a simple contact. To his contemporaries, Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=45}}\n\n[[File:Semmelweis Ign\u00e1c eml\u00e9km\u0171, Str\u00f3bl Alajos, 1904-06.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Semmelweis in front of Szent R\u00f3kus Hospital, Budapest, Hungary (erected in 1904, work of [[Alajos Str\u00f3bl]])]]\nThe so-called [[Semmelweis reflex]]\u2014a metaphor for a certain type of human behaviour characterized by reflex-like rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, beliefs, or paradigms\u2014is named after Semmelweis, whose ideas were ridiculed and rejected by his contemporaries.\n\nOther legacies of Semmelweis include:\n* Semmelweis is now recognized as a pioneer of [[antiseptic]] policy.\n* [[Semmelweis University]], a university for medicine and health-related disciplines (located in [[Budapest, Hungary]]), is named after Semmelweis.\n* The ''Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum'' (Semmelweis Medical History Museum) is located in the former home of Semmelweis.{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}}\n* The Semmelweis Klinik, a hospital for women located in Vienna, Austria.\n* The Semmelweis Hospital in [[Miskolc]], Hungary.\n* In 2008, Semmelweis was selected as the motif for an Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2008 coinage|commemorative coin]].{{sfn|Muenze Oesterreich AG|2017}}\n* Minor planet [[:de:(4170) Semmelweis|(4170) Semmelweis]] is named after him.\n* A postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932 in the Famous Hungarians series: ''[https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/141646-Ign\u00e1c_Semmelweis_1818~1865_physician-Personalities-Hungary Stamp:Ign\u00e1c Semmelweis (1818~1865), physician]''\n* Inclusion as a [[Google Doodle]] to promote handwashing beginning on 20 March 2020 during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].{{sfn |''Google'' |2020}}{{sfn |Musil |2020}}\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[That Mothers Might Live]]'' (1938), US, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], director: [[Fred Zinnemann]], Oscar for the best short film\n* ''Semmelweis'' (1940), Hungary, [[Mester Film]], director: [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]]\n* ''Semmelweis&nbsp;\u2013 Retter der M\u00fctter'' (1950), East Germany, [[DEFA]], director: [[Georg C.

Described as the \"saviour of mothers\",{{sfn|Semmelweis Society International}} Semmelweis discovered that the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[puerperal fever]] (also known as \"childbed fever\") could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in [[Obstetrics|obstetrical]] clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal. Semmelweis proposed the practice of [[hand washing|washing hands]] with [[calcium hypochlorite|chlorinated lime solutions]] in 1847 while working in [[Vienna General Hospital]]'s First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of [[Midwifery|midwives']] wards.{{sfn|Hanninen|Farago|Monos|1983}} He published a book of his findings in ''[[Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever]]''.\n\nDespite various publications of results where hand washing reduced [[Death|mortality]] to below 1%, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis supposedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] by his colleague. He died a mere 14 days later, at the age of 47, after being beaten by the guards, from a gangrenous wound on his right hand which might have been caused by the beating. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when [[Louis Pasteur]] confirmed the [[germ theory of disease|germ theory]], and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], acting on the French [[microbiologist]]'s research, practised and operated using hygienic methods, with great success.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis parents.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=At left, a painted portrait of a woman in a black dress with a frilled hood and ruffled collar.

He was the fifth child out of ten of the prosperous [[grocer]] family of J\u00f3zsef Semmelweis and Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller.\n\nOf [[Germans of Hungary|German]] ancestry, his father was an ethnic German (''hienc'', stem from {{illm|Heanzenland|de|display=1}}, a German term for the historical Western-Hungary) born in [[Eisenstadt|Kismarton]], then part of Hungary, now [[Eisenstadt]], Austria. He achieved permission to set up a shop in Buda in 1806{{efn-ua|Translated from: [er] erhielt 1806 das B\u00fcrgerrecht in Buda{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}}} and, in the same year, opened a wholesale business for spices and general consumer goods.{{efn-ua|Translated from: Spezereien- und Kolonialwarengro\u00dfhandlung{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}}} The company was named ''zum Wei\u00dfen Elefanten'' (at the White Elephant) in Meindl-Haus in [[Tab\u00e1n]] (today's 1-3, Apr\u00f3d Street, Semmelweis Museum of Medical History).{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}} By 1810, he was a wealthy man and married Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller, daughter of the coach (vehicle) builder F\u00fcl\u00f6p M\u00fcller.{{sfn|Antall|Szebell\u00e9dy|1973}}\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis began studying law at the [[University of Vienna]] in the autumn of 1837, but by the following year, for reasons that are no longer known, he had switched to medicine. He was awarded his doctor of medicine degree in 1844. Later, after failing to obtain an appointment in a clinic for internal medicine, Semmelweis decided to specialize in obstetrics.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=16}} His teachers included [[Carl von Rokitansky]], [[Joseph \u0160koda]] and [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand von Hebra]].\n\n==Work on cause of childbed fever mortality==\n===Position at Vienna General Hospital===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}<!--most of the text beneath the table has no citations-->\n[[File:Semmelweis statue.jpg|thumb|Semmelweis statue at the [[University of Tehran]]]]\nSemmelweis was appointed assistant to Professor [[Johann Klein]] in the First Obstetrical Clinic of the [[Vienna General Hospital]] on July 1, 1846.{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=72}}{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=34|2a1=Schmidt|2y=1850|2p=501}}{{efn-ua|Details: On July 1, 1844 Semmelweis became a trainee physician's assistant at the Vienna maternity clinic (in German, ''Aspirant Assistentarztes an der Wiener Geburtshilflichen Klinik'') and on July 1, 1846 he was appointed an ordinary physician's assistant (in German, ''ordentlicher Assistentarzt''). However, on 20 October 1846 his predecessor Dr. [[Franz Breit (obstetrician)|Franz Breit]] (an obstetrician) unexpectedly returned, and Semmelweis was demoted. By March 20, 1847, Dr. Breit was appointed professor in [[T\u00fcbingen]] and Semmelweis resumed the ''Assistentarzt'' position.{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=72}}}} A comparable position today in a United States hospital would be \"chief resident.\"{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=56}} His duties were to examine patients each morning in preparation for the professor's rounds, supervise difficult deliveries, teach students of obstetrics and be \"clerk\" of records.\n\nMaternity institutions were set up all over Europe to address problems of [[infanticide]] of illegitimate children. They were set up as ''gratis'' institutions and offered to care for the infants, which made them attractive to [[underprivileged]] women, including prostitutes. In return for the free services, the women would be subjects for the training of doctors and midwives.\n\nTwo maternity clinics were at the Viennese hospital. The First Clinic had an average [[Maternal bond|maternal]] [[mortality rate]] of about 10% due to puerperal fever. The Second Clinic's rate was considerably lower, averaging less than 4%. This fact was known outside the hospital. The two clinics admitted on alternate days, but women begged to be admitted to the Second Clinic, due to the bad reputation of the First Clinic.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=69}} Semmelweis described desperate women begging on their knees not to be admitted to the First Clinic.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=70}} Some women even preferred to give birth in the streets, pretending to have given sudden birth ''en route'' to the hospital (a practice known as street births), which meant they would still qualify for the child care benefits without having been admitted to the clinic. Semmelweis was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare among women giving street births. \"To me, it appeared logical that patients who experienced street births would become ill at least as frequently as those who delivered in the clinic. [...] What protected those who delivered outside the clinic from these destructive unknown endemic influences?\"{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=81}}\n\n===Analysis of childbed fever mortality===\n\nSemmelweis was severely troubled that his First Clinic had a much higher mortality rate due to puerperal fever than the Second Clinic. It \"made me so miserable that life seemed worthless\".{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=86}} The two clinics used almost the same techniques, and Semmelweis started eliminating all possible differences, including even religious practices. The only major difference was the individuals who worked there. The First Clinic was the teaching service for medical students, while the Second Clinic had been selected in 1841 for the instruction of midwives only.\n\n[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1841-1846 two clinics.png|thumb|right|500px|[[Puerperal fever]] mortality rates for the First and Second Clinics at the Vienna General Hospital 1841\u20131846: The First Clinic has the higher mortality rate.]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"<!--generated with [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]] V1.7-->\n|+ [[Puerperal fever]] mortality rates for the First and Second Clinic at the Vienna General Hospital 1841\u20131846.

He eliminated climate as a cause because the climate was the same.\n\n===Theory of cadaverous poisoning===\n\nSemmelweis' breakthrough occurred in 1847, following the death of his good friend [[Jakob Kolletschka]], who had been accidentally poked with a student's scalpel while performing a [[Autopsy|''post mortem'' examination]]. Kolletschka's own autopsy showed a [[pathology]] similar to that of the women who were dying from puerperal fever. Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between [[cadaver]]ic contamination and puerperal fever.{{sfn|Lane|2010}}\n\nHe proposed that he and the medical students carried \"cadaverous particles\" on their hands{{efn-ua|Semmelweis's reference to \"cadaverous particles\" were (in German) \"''an der Hand klebende Cadavertheile''\"{{sfn|Benedek|1983|page=95}}}} from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic. This explained why the student [[Midwife|midwives]] in the Second Clinic, who were not engaged in autopsies and had no contact with corpses, saw a much lower mortality rate.\n\nThe [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been accepted in Vienna. Thus, Semmelweis concluded some unknown \"cadaverous material\" caused childbed fever. He instituted a policy of using a solution of chlorinated lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) for washing hands between autopsy work and the examination of patients. He did this because he found that this chlorinated solution worked best to remove the putrid smell of infected autopsy tissue, and thus perhaps destroyed the causal \"poisonous\" or contaminating \"cadaveric\" agent hypothetically being transmitted by this material.\n\nThe result was the mortality rate in the First Clinic declined 90%, and was then comparable to that in the Second Clinic. The mortality rate in April 1847 was 18.3%. After [[hand washing]] was instituted in mid-May, the rates in June were 2.2%, July 1.2%, August 1.9% and, for the first time since the introduction of anatomical orientation, the death rate was zero in two months in the year following this discovery.\n\n==Efforts to reduce childbed fever==\nSemmelweis's hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.\n\nSemmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European obstetricians, at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly twenty years after his breakthrough, he was committed to the ''Landesirrenanstalt [[D\u00f6bling]]'' (provincial lunatic asylum). He died there of [[Sepsis|septic shock]] only 14 days later, possibly as the result of being severely beaten by guards. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur further developed the germ theory of disease, offering a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis's findings. He is considered a pioneer of antiseptic procedures.\n\n===Conflict with established medical opinion===\n{{Main|Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis}}\n[[File:Monthly mortality rates 1841-1849.png|thumb|500px|[[Puerperal fever]] monthly mortality rates for the First Clinic at Vienna Maternity Institution 1841\u20131849. Rates drop markedly when Semmelweis implemented chlorine [[hand washing]] mid-May 1847 [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Monthly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1841\u20131849|(see rates)]].]]\n\nSemmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time. The theory of diseases was highly influenced by ideas of an imbalance of the basic \"[[Humorism|four humours]]\" in the body, a theory known as [[dyscrasia]], for which the main treatment was [[bloodletting]]s. Medical texts at the time emphasized that each case of disease was unique, the result of a personal imbalance, and the main difficulty of the medical profession was to establish precisely each patient's unique situation, case by case.\n\nThe findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of physical signs, which emphasized the belief that puerperal fever was not one, but many different, yet unidentified, diseases.\n\nThe rejection of Semmelweis's empirical observations is often traced to [[belief perseverance]], the psychological tendency of clinging to discredited beliefs. Also, some historians of science{{sfn|Nissani|1995|pp=165\u2013183}} argue that resistance to path-breaking contributions of obscure scientists is common and \"constitutes the single most formidable block to scientific advances.\"\n\nAs a result, his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Other, more subtle, factors may also have played a role. Some doctors, for instance, were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands, feeling that their social status as gentlemen was inconsistent with the idea that their hands could be unclean.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=9}}{{efn-ua|See for instance [[Charles Delucena Meigs]], in which there is a link to an original source document.}}\n\nSemmelweis's results lacked scientific explanation at the time. That became possible only some decades later, when [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Joseph Lister]], and others further developed the germ theory of disease.\n\nDuring 1848, Semmelweis widened the scope of his washing protocol, to include all instruments coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates [[time series]] to document his success in virtually eliminating puerperal fever from the hospital ward.\n\n===Hesitant publication of results and first signs of trouble===\n[[File:Streptococcus pyogenes.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (red-stained spheres) is responsible for most cases of severe [[puerperal fever]]. It is commonly found in the throat and [[nasopharynx]] of otherwise healthy carriers.]]\nToward the end of 1847, accounts of the work of Semmelweis (as well as the similar conclusions of Holmes, working in America){{sfn|Lane|2010}} began to spread around Europe. Semmelweis and his students wrote letters to the directors of several prominent maternity clinics describing their recent observations. [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand von Hebra]], the editor of a leading Austrian medical journal, announced Semmelweis's discovery in the December 1847{{sfn|Hebra|1847}} and April 1848{{sfn|Hebra|1848}} issues of the medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis's work had a practical significance comparable to that of [[Edward Jenner]]'s introduction of cowpox inoculations to prevent smallpox.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=54\u201355}}\n\nIn late 1848, one of Semmelweis's former students wrote a lecture explaining Semmelweis's work. The lecture was presented before the Royal Medical and Surgical Society in London and a review published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', a prominent medical journal.{{efn-ua|The author of the lecture was Charles Henry Felix Routh, but it was delivered by Edward William Murphy since Routh was not a Fellow of the Royal Medical and Surgical Society. (Lecture: ''On the Causes of the Endemic Puerperal Fever of Vienna'', Medico-chirurgical Transactions 32(1849): 27\u201340. Review: Lancet 2(1848): 642f.) For a list of some other reviews, see Frank P. Murphy, \"Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (1818\u20131865): An Annotated Bibliography,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 20 (1946), 653\u2013707: 654f.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=175}}}} A few months later, another of Semmelweis's former students published a similar essay in a French periodical.{{sfn|Wieger|1849}}\n\nAs accounts of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine washings would be widely adopted, saving tens of thousands of lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. [[James Young Simpson]], for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis's groundbreaking findings and the idea presented in an 1843 paper by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]{{sfn|Holmes|1843}} that childbed fever was contagious (''i.e''. that infected persons could pass the infection to others).{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=10\u201312}} Indeed, initial responses to Semmelweis's findings were that ''he had said nothing new''.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=31}}\n\nIn fact, Semmelweis was warning against all decaying organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of childbed fever themselves. This misunderstanding, and others like it, occurred partly because Semmelweis's work was known only through secondhand reports written by his colleagues and students. At this crucial stage, Semmelweis himself had published nothing. These and similar misinterpretations continued to cloud discussions of his work throughout the century.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=56}}\n\nSome accounts emphasize that Semmelweis refused to communicate his method officially to the learned circles of Vienna,{{sfn|Reid|1975|p=37}} nor was he eager to explain it on paper.\n\n===Political turmoil and dismissal from the Vienna hospital===\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|a series of tumultuous revolutions]] swept across Europe. The resulting political turmoil would affect Semmelweis's career. In Vienna on 13 March 1848 students demonstrated in favor of increased [[civil rights]], including trial by jury and [[freedom of expression]]. The demonstrations were led by medical students and young faculty members and were joined by workers from the suburbs. Two days later in Hungary, demonstrations and uprisings led to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and a full-scale war against the ruling [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] of the [[Austrian Empire]]. In Vienna, the March demonstration was followed by months of general unrest.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=57}}\n\nNo evidence indicates Semmelweis was personally involved in the events of 1848. Some of his brothers were punished for active participation in the Hungarian independence movement, and the Hungarian-born Semmelweis likely was sympathetic to the cause. Semmelweis's superior, professor [[Johann Klein]], was a conservative Austrian, likely uneasy with the independence movements and alarmed by the other [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas]]. Klein probably mistrusted Semmelweis.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=59}}\n\nWhen Semmelweis's term was about to expire, [[Carl Braun (obstetrician)|Carl Braun]] also applied for the position of \"assistant\" in the First Clinic, possibly at Klein's own invitation. Semmelweis and Braun were the only two applicants for the post. Semmelweis's predecessor, [[Franz Breit (obstetrician)|Franz Breit]], had been granted a two-year extension.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=61, 105}} Semmelweis's application for an extension was supported by [[Joseph \u0160koda]] and [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky|Carl von Rokitansky]] and by most of the medical faculty, but Klein chose Braun for the position. Semmelweis was obliged to leave the obstetrical clinic when his term expired on March 20, 1849.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=61}}\n\nThe day his term expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese authorities to be made [[Privatdozent|docent]] of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but had to wait until 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=105}} The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated [[mannequin]]s only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying good-bye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that might have offended them.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=52}} According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was \"unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment\".{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Life in Budapest===\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1857 Wedding picture.jpg|thumb|left|alt=At left, a painting of a balding, mustachioed middle-aged man in black-tie formal attire standing beside a red table. At right, a painting of a woman in a blue dress with white stripes, standing beside a red table.|Wedding portraits of Ignaz Semmelweis and M\u00e1ria Weidenhofer (1857)]]\nDuring 1848\u20131849, some {{nowrap|70,000}} troops from the [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austrian Empire]] thwarted the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian independence movement]], executed or imprisoned its leaders and in the process destroyed parts of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. Semmelweis, upon arriving from the Habsburg Vienna in 1850, likely was not warmly welcomed in Pest.\n\nOn 20 May 1851, Semmelweis took the relatively insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician position of the obstetric ward of Pest's small [[Saint Roch|Szent R\u00f3kus]] Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|p=107|2a1=Carter|2a2=Carter|2y=2005|2p=68}} Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851\u20131855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=106\u2013108}}\n\nDespite the impressive results, Semmelweis's ideas were not accepted by the other obstetricians in Budapest.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}} The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, [[Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly]], never adopted Semmelweis's methods. He continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=24}} Therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.\n\nAfter Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis applied for the position. So did Carl Braun\u2014Semmelweis's nemesis and successor as [[Johann Klein]]'s assistant in Vienna\u2014and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled the wishes of the Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor of obstetrics, Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest [[maternity clinic]]. Once again, the results were impressive.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}}\n\nSemmelweis declined an offer in 1857 to become professor of obstetrics at the [[University of Zurich]].{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=56}} The same year, Semmelweis married M\u00e1ria Weidenhofer (1837\u20131910), 19 years his junior and the daughter of a successful merchant in Pest. They had five children.\n\n===Response by the medical community===\n{{Main|Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|}}\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1861 Etiology front page.jpg|thumb|right|Semmelweis's main work: ''Die \u00c4tiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers'', 1861 (front page)]]\n[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|500px|In his 1861 book, Semmelweis presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in Wien (Vienna) in 1823 (vertical line) was accompanied by the increased incidence of fatal childbed fever.

Rates for the Dublin [[Rotunda Hospital|Rotunda maternity hospital]], which had no pathological anatomy, are shown for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784\u20131849|view rates]]).]]\nSemmelweis's views were much more favorably received in the [[United Kingdom]] than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood. The British consistently regarded Semmelweis as having supported their theory of contagion. A typical example was W. Tyler Smith, who claimed that Semmelweis \"made out very conclusively\" that \"[[Homeopathy|miasms]] derived from the dissecting room will excite puerperal disease.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=176|2a1=Tyler Smith|2y=1856|2p=504}} One of the first to respond to Semmelweis's 1848 communications was [[James Young Simpson]], who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis would have known that the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=174}}\n\nIn 1856, Semmelweis's assistant Josef Fleischer reported the successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity institutions in the'' Viennese Medical Weekly ''(''[[Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift]]'').{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=69}} The editor remarked sarcastically that it was time people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=24|2a1=Fleischer|2y=1856|2p=536}} Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled \"The Etiology of Childbed Fever\".{{efn-ua|The report was \"''A gyermek\u00e1gyi l\u00e1z k\u00f3roktana''\" (\"The Etiology of Childbed Fever\") published in ''Orvosi hetilap'' '''2''' (1858); a translation into German is included in Tiberius von Gy\u00f6ry's, ''Semmelweis's gesammelte Werke'' (Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1905), 61\u201383. This was Semmelweis's first publication on the subject of puerperal fever. According to Gy\u0151ry, the substance of the report was contained in lectures delivered before the ''Budapester K\u00f6nigliche \u00c2rzteverein'' in the spring of 1858.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=112}}}} Two years after that, he published a second essay, \"The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever\".{{efn-ua|The article was originally published as: Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, \"A gyermek\u00e1gyi l\u00e1z f\u00f6l\u00f6tti v\u00e9lem\u00e9nyk\u00fcl\u00f6nbs\u00e9g k\u00f6ztem s az angol orvosok k\u00f6zt\" Orvosi hetilap '''4''' (1860), 849\u2013851, 873\u2013876, 889\u2013893, 913\u2013915.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=24}}}} In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work ''Die \u00c4tiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers'' (German for \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\"){{efn-ua|[http://real-eod.mtak.hu/2450/ Digital copy of Semmelweis' book]}}. In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: \"Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at W\u00fcrzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected\".{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=169}}{{efn-ua|The monograph to which Semmelweis refers was a work by Heinrich Silberschmidt, \"Historisch-kritische Darstellung der Pathologie des Kindbettfiebers von den \u00e4ltesten Zeiten bis auf die unserige\", published 1859 in [[Erlangen]], which mentions Semmelweis only incidentally and without dealing at all with the transfer of toxic materials by the hands of physicians and midwives. The book was awarded a prize by the medical faculty of W\u00fcrzburg at the instigation of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels]]{{sfnm|1a1=Hauzman|1y=2006|2a1=Semmelweis|2y=1983|2p=212}}}}\n\nIn a textbook, Carl Braun, Semmelweis's successor as assistant in the first clinic, identified 30 causes of childbed fever; only the 28th of these was cadaverous infection. Other causes included conception and pregnancy, uremia, pressure exerted on adjacent organs by the shrinking uterus, emotional traumata, mistakes in diet, chilling, and atmospheric epidemic influences.{{sfn|Braun|1857}}{{efn-ua|Carl Braun's thirty causes appear in his ''Lehrbuch der Geburtsh\u00fclfe''. In the first of these, published in 1855, he mentions Semmelweis in connection with his discussion of cause number 28, cadaverous poisoning. In the later version, however, although he discusses the same cause in the same terms, all references to Semmelweis have been dropped.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=34*}}}}\n\nDespite this opposition, Braun, who was Assistant in the First Division in the period April 1849 to Summer 1853, maintained a relatively low mortality rate in the First Division, roughly consistent with the rate Semmelweis himself achieved, as [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Mortality rates at the Vienna General Hospital#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1833-1858 for first and second clinics|mortality rates]] in the period April 1849 to end 1853 show. These results suggest that Braun continued, assiduously, to require the chlorine washings.\n\nAt a conference of German physicians and [[natural scientist]]s, most of the speakers rejected his doctrine, including the celebrated [[Rudolf Virchow]], who was a scientist of the highest authority of his time. Virchow's great authority in medical circles contributed potently to Semmelweis' lack of recognition.{{sfn|Hauzman|2006}} [[Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly]], Semmelweis's predecessor as Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Pest, never accepted Semmelweis's teachings; he continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=4}} [[August Breisky]], an obstetrician in Prague, rejected Semmelweis's book as \"na\u00efve\" and he referred to it as \"the Koran of puerperal theology\". Breisky objected that Semmelweis had not proved that puerperal fever and [[pyemia]] are identical, and he insisted that other factors beyond decaying organic matter certainly had to be included in the [[etiology]] of the disease.{{sfnm|1a1=Semmelweis|1y=1983|1p=41|2a1=Breisky|2y=1861|2p=1}} [[Carl Edvard Marius Levy]], head of the Copenhagen maternity hospital and an outspoken critic of Semmelweis's ideas, had reservations concerning the unspecific nature of cadaverous particles and that the supposed quantities were unreasonably small.{{sfnm|Semmelweis|1983|pp=180\u2013181|Levy|1848}} In fact, [[Robert Koch]] later used precisely this fact to prove that various infecting materials contained living organisms which could reproduce in the human body; that is, since the poison could be neither chemical nor physical in operation, it must be biological.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=183}}\n\nIt has been contended that Semmelweis could have had an even greater impact if he had managed to communicate his findings more effectively and avoid antagonising the medical establishment, even given the opposition from entrenched viewpoints.{{sfn|Nuland|2003}}\n\n==Breakdown and death==\n[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1862 Open letter.jpg|thumb|left|Semmelweis's 1862 ''Open Letter to all Professors of Obstetrics'']]\nBeginning in 1861, Semmelweis suffered from various nervous complaints. He suffered from severe depression and became absentminded. Paintings from 1857 to 1864 show a progression of aging.{{efn-ua|Paintings of Semmelweis available in the 1983 edition of his ''Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever'',{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=57}} and at [[Commons:Category:Ignaz Semmelweis|Wikimedia Commons]].}} He turned every conversation to the topic of childbed fever.\n\nAfter a number of unfavorable foreign reviews of his 1861 book, Semmelweis lashed out against his critics in a series of Open Letters.{{efn-ua|The 1862 open letter is available at the  {{URL|1=http://www.literature.at/viewer.alo?viewmode=overview&objid=13184&page= |2=Austrian national library}} website.}} They were addressed to various prominent European obstetricians, including [[Joseph Sp\u00e4th|Sp\u00e4th]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels|Scanzoni]], [[Eduard Caspar Jacob von Siebold|Siebold]], and to \"all obstetricians\". They were full of bitterness, desperation, and fury and were \"highly polemical and superlatively offensive\",{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=57}} at times denouncing his critics as irresponsible murderers{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=73}} or ignoramuses.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=41}} He also called upon Siebold to arrange a meeting of German obstetricians somewhere in Germany to provide a forum for discussions on puerperal fever, where he would stay \"until all have been converted to his theory.\"{{sfn|Hauzman|2006}}\n\nIn mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes in the company of a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=74}}\n\nThe exact nature of Semmelweis's affliction has been a subject of some debate. According to K Codell Carter, in his biography of Semmelweis, the exact nature of his affliction cannot be determined:<blockquote>It is impossible to appraise the nature of Semmelweis's disorder. ... It might have been [[Alzheimer's disease]], a type of dementia, which is associated with rapid cognitive decline and mood changes.{{sfn|Nuland|2003|p=270}} It might have been third-stage [[syphilis]], a then-common disease of obstetricians who examined thousands of women at gratis institutions, or it might have been emotional exhaustion from overwork and stress.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=75}}</blockquote>In 1865, [[J\u00e1nos Balassa]] wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution. On July 30, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra lured him, under the pretense of visiting one of Hebra's \"new Institutes\", to a Viennese insane asylum located in Lazarettgasse (''Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse'').{{sfn|Benedek|1983|p=293}} Semmelweis surmised what was happening and tried to leave. He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a [[straitjacket]], and confined to a darkened cell. Apart from the straitjacket, treatments at the [[mental institution]] included dousing with cold water and administering [[castor oil]], a [[laxative]]. He died after two weeks, on August 13, 1865, aged 47, from a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] wound, due to an infection on his right hand which might have been caused by the struggle. The autopsy gave the cause of death as [[pyemia]]\u2014[[blood poisoning]].{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=76\u201378}}\n\nSemmelweis was buried in Vienna on August 15, 1865. Only a few people attended the service.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=78}} Brief announcements of his death appeared in a few medical periodicals in Vienna and Budapest. Although the rules of the Hungarian Association of Physicians and Natural Scientists specified that a commemorative address be delivered in honor of a member who had died in the preceding year, there was no address for Semmelweis; his death was never even mentioned.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=79}}\n\nJ\u00e1nos Diescher was appointed Semmelweis's successor at the Pest University maternity clinic. Immediately, mortality rates increased sixfold to 6%, but the physicians of Budapest said nothing; there were no inquiries and no protests. Almost no one\u2014either in Vienna or in Budapest\u2014seems to have been willing to acknowledge Semmelweis's life and work.{{sfn|Carter|Carter|2005|p=79}}\n\nHis remains were transferred to Budapest in 1891. On 11 October 1964, they were transferred once more to the house in which he was born. The house{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}} is now a historical museum and library, honoring Ignaz Semmelweis.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=58}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:50 EURO Gold Coin - Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis - Austria.jpg|thumb|right|alt=At left, the obverse of a golden coin depicts a bust of Semmelweis as an old man, accompanied by the rod of Asclepius; it bears the inscription \"IGNAZ PHILLIP SEMMELWEIS 1818 1865 50 EURO 2008 REPUBLIK \u00d6STERREICH\".

Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared quite willing to experiment with the practical [[hand washing]] measures that he proposed\u2014although virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking theoretical innovation: that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=48}} [[Gustav Adolf Michaelis]], a professor at a maternity institution in [[Kiel]], replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions, but eventually committed suicide, feeling responsible for the death of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|pp=176\u2013178}}\n\nOnly belatedly did his observational evidence gain wide acceptance; more than twenty years later, [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work offered a ''theoretical'' explanation for Semmelweis' observations: the germ theory of disease. As such, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with [[epistemology]] content, e.g. philosophy of science courses\u2014demonstrating the virtues of [[empiricism]] or [[positivism]] and providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not. It has been seen as an irony that Semmelweis' critics considered themselves positivists, but even positivism suffers problems in the face of theories which seem magical or superstitious, such as the idea that \"corpse particles\" might turn a person into a corpse, with no causal mechanism being stipulated, after a simple contact. To his contemporaries, Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries.{{sfn|Semmelweis|1983|p=45}}\n\n[[File:Semmelweis Ign\u00e1c eml\u00e9km\u0171, Str\u00f3bl Alajos, 1904-06.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Semmelweis in front of Szent R\u00f3kus Hospital, Budapest, Hungary (erected in 1904, work of [[Alajos Str\u00f3bl]])]]\nThe so-called [[Semmelweis reflex]]\u2014a metaphor for a certain type of human behaviour characterized by reflex-like rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, beliefs, or paradigms\u2014is named after Semmelweis, whose ideas were ridiculed and rejected by his contemporaries.\n\nOther legacies of Semmelweis include:\n* Semmelweis is now recognized as a pioneer of [[antiseptic]] policy.\n* [[Semmelweis University]], a university for medicine and health-related disciplines (located in [[Budapest, Hungary]]), is named after Semmelweis.\n* The ''Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum'' (Semmelweis Medical History Museum) is located in the former home of Semmelweis.{{sfn|Semmelweis Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum}}\n* The Semmelweis Klinik, a hospital for women located in Vienna, Austria.\n* The Semmelweis Hospital in [[Miskolc]], Hungary.\n* In 2008, Semmelweis was selected as the motif for an Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2008 coinage|commemorative coin]].{{sfn|Muenze Oesterreich AG|2017}}\n* Minor planet [[:de:(4170) Semmelweis|(4170) Semmelweis]] is named after him.\n* A postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932 in the Famous Hungarians series: ''[https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/141646-Ign\u00e1c_Semmelweis_1818~1865_physician-Personalities-Hungary Stamp:Ign\u00e1c Semmelweis (1818~1865), physician]''\n* Inclusion as a [[Google Doodle]] to promote handwashing beginning on 20 March 2020 during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].{{sfn |''Google'' |2020}}{{sfn |Musil |2020}}\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[That Mothers Might Live]]'' (1938), US, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], director: [[Fred Zinnemann]], Oscar for the best short film\n* ''Semmelweis'' (1940), Hungary, [[Mester Film]], director: [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]]\n* ''Semmelweis&nbsp;\u2013 Retter der M\u00fctter'' (1950), East Germany, [[DEFA]], director: [[Georg C.

There are [[archaeological site]]s on the island.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View 071, Verdant Euphantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt, 1908.jpg|thumbnail|left|Verdant Elephantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt\", 1908. Lantern slide. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Island of Elephantine (Egypt) - Edwin Howland Blashfield - overall.jpg|thumb|left|Island of Elephantine, by [[Edwin Blashfield|Edwin Howland Blashfield]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nElephantine is {{convert|1200|m|ft}} from north to south, and is {{convert|400|m|ft}} across at its widest point. The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]], at the southern border of [[Upper Egypt]] with [[Lower Nubia]]. This region above is referred to as Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile.\n\nThe island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar to that of an [[elephant tusk]], or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling elephants.\n\n==Ancient Egypt==\nKnown to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as [[Wikt:\ua723bw|\ua723bw]] \"Elephant\" ([[Middle Egyptian]]: {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0280u\u02d0baw/}} \u2192 Medio-Late Egyptian: {{IPA|/\u02c8ju\u02d0b\u0259\u0294/}} \u2192 Coptic: (\u2c88)\u2c93\u2c8f\u2c83 {{IPA|/\u02c8je\u03b2/}}), the island of Elephantine stood at the border between Egypt and Nubia. It was an excellent defensive site for a city and its location made it a natural cargo transfer point for river trade. This border is near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the most northerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead at noon and from which it appears to reverse direction or \"turn back\" at the [[solstices]]. \n\nElephantine was a fort that stood just before the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the Nile.  During the Second Intermediate Period (1650\u20131550 BC), the fort marked the southern border of Egypt.<ref>Ian Shaw, Ed, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, New York, 2000, page 206</ref>\n\nAccording to [[ancient Egyptian religion]], Elephantine was the dwelling place of [[Khnum]], the ram-headed god of the cataracts, who guarded and controlled the waters of the Nile from caves beneath the island. He was worshipped here as part of a late [[triple deity|triad]] of [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian deities]]. This \"Elephantine Triad\" included [[Satis (goddess)|Satis]] and [[Anuket]]. Satis was worshipped from very early times as a [[war goddess]] and protector of this strategic region of Egypt. When seen as a [[fertility goddess]], she personified the bountiful annual flooding of the Nile, which was identified as her daughter, Anuket.  The cult of Satis originated in the ancient city of [[Aswan]]. Later, when the triad was formed, Khnum became identified as her consort and, thereby, was thought of as the father of Anuket. His role in myths changed later and another deity was assigned his duties with the river. At that time his role as a potter enabled him to be assigned a duty in the creation of human bodies.\n\n[[File:KhnoumTempleElephantine.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Temple of [[Khnum]].]]\n\n===Archaeological sites===\nOngoing excavations by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at the town have uncovered many findings, on display in the Aswan Museum located on the island, including a [[mummy|mummified]] ram of Khnum. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] dating back to [[prehistoric Egypt]] have been found on Elephantine. A rare [[calendar]], known as the ''Elephantine Calendar of Things'', which dates to the reign of [[Thutmose III]] during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], was found in fragments on the island.\n\nIn ancient times the island was also an important [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt|stone quarry]], providing [[granite]] for monuments and buildings all over Egypt.\n\n====Temples====\nPrior to 1822, there were temples to [[Thutmose III]] and [[Amenhotep III]] on the island. At that time they were destroyed during the campaign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who had taken power in Egypt, to [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty#Invasion of Libya and Sudan|conquer Sudan]]. Both temples were relatively intact prior to the deliberate demolition.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first temple was the [[Temple of Satet]], it was founded around 3000 BC and enlarged and renovated over the next 3,000 years. There are records of an [[Egyptian temple]] to Khnum on the island as early as the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]]. This temple was completely rebuilt in the Late Period, during the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt]], just before the foreign rule that followed in the Graeco-Roman Period. The Greeks formed the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] during their three-hundred-year rule over Egypt (305\u201330 BC) and maintained the ancient religious customs and traditions, while often associating the Egyptian deities with their own.\n\nMost of the present day southern tip of the island is taken up by the ruins of the Temple of Khnum. These, the oldest ruins still standing on the island, are composed of a granite [[step pyramid]] from the Third Dynasty and a small temple built for the local [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] [[nomarch]], [[Heqaib]]. In the Middle Kingdom, many officials, such as the local governors [[Sarenput I]] or [[Heqaib III]], dedicated statues and shrines into the temple.\n\n[[File:IlhaElefantina.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Aswan Museum]], and a [[nilometer]] (lower left).]]\n\n====Nilometers====\nA [[nilometer]] was a structure for measuring the Nile River's clarity and the water level during the annual flood season. There are two nilometers at Elephantine Island. The more famous is a corridor nilometer associated with the Temple of Satis, with a stone staircase that descends the corridor. It is one of the oldest nilometers in Egypt, last reconstructed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and still in use as late as the nineteenth century AD. Ninety steps that lead down to the river are marked with [[Arabic numerals|Arabic]], [[Roman numerals|Roman]], and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] numerals.  Visible at the water's edge are inscriptions carved deeply into the rock during the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]].\n\nThe other Nilometer is a rectangular basin located at the island's southern tip, near the Temple of Khnum and opposite the Old Cataract Hotel. It is probably the older of the two. One of the nilometers, though it is not certain which, is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Strabo]].\n\nMany sources claim that the fabled \"Well of Eratosthenes\", famous in connection with [[Eratosthenes]]' presumed calculation of the [[Earth's circumference]], was located on the island. Strabo mentions a well that was used to observe that Aswan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], but the reference is to a well at [[Aswan]], not at Elephantine. Neither nilometer at Elephantine is suitable for the purpose, while the well at Aswan is apparently lost.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyboom|first=P. G. P. |authorlink=P. G. P.

There are [[archaeological site]]s on the island.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View 071, Verdant Euphantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt, 1908.jpg|thumbnail|left|Verdant Elephantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt\", 1908. Lantern slide. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Island of Elephantine (Egypt) - Edwin Howland Blashfield - overall.jpg|thumb|left|Island of Elephantine, by [[Edwin Blashfield|Edwin Howland Blashfield]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nElephantine is {{convert|1200|m|ft}} from north to south, and is {{convert|400|m|ft}} across at its widest point. The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]], at the southern border of [[Upper Egypt]] with [[Lower Nubia]]. This region above is referred to as Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile.\n\nThe island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar to that of an [[elephant tusk]], or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling elephants.\n\n==Ancient Egypt==\nKnown to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as [[Wikt:\ua723bw|\ua723bw]] \"Elephant\" ([[Middle Egyptian]]: {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0280u\u02d0baw/}} \u2192 Medio-Late Egyptian: {{IPA|/\u02c8ju\u02d0b\u0259\u0294/}} \u2192 Coptic: (\u2c88)\u2c93\u2c8f\u2c83 {{IPA|/\u02c8je\u03b2/}}), the island of Elephantine stood at the border between Egypt and Nubia. It was an excellent defensive site for a city and its location made it a natural cargo transfer point for river trade. This border is near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the most northerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead at noon and from which it appears to reverse direction or \"turn back\" at the [[solstices]]. \n\nElephantine was a fort that stood just before the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the Nile.  During the Second Intermediate Period (1650\u20131550 BC), the fort marked the southern border of Egypt.<ref>Ian Shaw, Ed, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, New York, 2000, page 206</ref>\n\nAccording to [[ancient Egyptian religion]], Elephantine was the dwelling place of [[Khnum]], the ram-headed god of the cataracts, who guarded and controlled the waters of the Nile from caves beneath the island. He was worshipped here as part of a late [[triple deity|triad]] of [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian deities]]. This \"Elephantine Triad\" included [[Satis (goddess)|Satis]] and [[Anuket]]. Satis was worshipped from very early times as a [[war goddess]] and protector of this strategic region of Egypt. When seen as a [[fertility goddess]], she personified the bountiful annual flooding of the Nile, which was identified as her daughter, Anuket.  The cult of Satis originated in the ancient city of [[Aswan]]. Later, when the triad was formed, Khnum became identified as her consort and, thereby, was thought of as the father of Anuket. His role in myths changed later and another deity was assigned his duties with the river. At that time his role as a potter enabled him to be assigned a duty in the creation of human bodies.\n\n[[File:KhnoumTempleElephantine.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Temple of [[Khnum]].]]\n\n===Archaeological sites===\nOngoing excavations by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at the town have uncovered many findings, on display in the Aswan Museum located on the island, including a [[mummy|mummified]] ram of Khnum.

That encompasses parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Burma, as well as four provinces of China. Zomia's 100 million residents are minority peoples \"of truly bewildering ethnic and linguistic variety\", he writes.

to integrate Zomia peoples and territory to increase their landholdings, resources, and people subject to taxation\u2014in other words, to raise revenue.<ref name=\"Scott-2009\" /> Scott argues that these many minority groups are \"...using their culture, farming practices, egalitarian political structures, prophet-led rebellions, and even their lack of writing systems to put distance between themselves and the states that wished to engulf them.\"<ref name=\"Chronicle-2011\" /> Tribes today do not live outside history according to Scott, but have \"as much history as they require\" and

That encompasses parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Burma, as well as four provinces of China. Zomia's 100 million residents are minority peoples \"of truly bewildering ethnic and linguistic variety\", he writes. Among them are the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Mien people|Mien]], and [[Wa people]]s.<ref name=\"Chronicle-2011\">{{cite

portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects\u2014[[slavery]], [[conscription]], taxes, [[corv\u00e9e]], epidemics, and warfare\u2014of the [[nation state]] societies that surround them.<ref name=\"Truthout-2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Drake|title=The mystery of

\u201c[[anarchism|anarchist]] history\", is the first examination of the huge literature on [[nation-building]] whose author evaluates why people would choose deliberately remain [[statelessness|stateless]].\n\nScott's main argument is that these people are \"barbaric by design\": their social organization, geographical location, subsistence practices and culture have been maintained to discourage states from curtailing their freedoms.<ref name=\"NM-20191021\">{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=Gabriel |title='We try to not be Thai': the everyday resistance of ethnic

to integrate Zomia peoples and territory to increase their landholdings, resources, and people subject to taxation\u2014in other words, to raise revenue.<ref name=\"Scott-2009\" /> Scott argues that these many minority groups are \"...using their culture, farming practices, egalitarian political structures, prophet-led rebellions, and even their lack of writing systems to put distance between themselves and the states that wished to engulf them.\"<ref name=\"Chronicle-2011\" /> Tribes today, Scott suggests, do not live outside history, but have \"as much history as they require\" in order to deliberately practice \"state avoidance.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Robert D |title=Foreign Policy: Why It's Hard For Strongmen To Leave

claims\" in his book, but credits many other scholars, including the French anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] and the American historian [[Owen Lattimore]], as influences.<ref name=\"Chronicle-2011\"
