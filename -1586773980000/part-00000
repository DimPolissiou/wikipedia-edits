The successor to the successful [[Sega Genesis]], the Saturn has a dual-[[Central processing unit|CPU]] architecture and eight processors. Its games are in [[CD-ROM]] format, and its game library contains several [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[Porting|ports]] as well as original games.\n\nDevelopment of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Sega Model 1|Model 1]] [[Arcade system board|arcade hardware]] debuted. The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company [[Hitachi]]. Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with [[Sony]]'s forthcoming [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].\n\nThe Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the [[Nintendo 64]] in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, known in development as ''[[Sonic X-treme]]'', has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.\n\nAlthough the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games, including ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'', the ''[[Panzer Dragoon (series)|Panzer Dragoon]]'' series, and the ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' series, its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited [[third-party developer|third-party]] support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system's development and discontinuation.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nReleased in 1988, the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive in Europe, Japan and Australia) was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|access-date=May 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100219/http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In mid-1990, Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] hired [[Tom Kalinske]] as president and CEO of Sega of America.

The successor to the successful [[Sega Genesis]], the Saturn has a dual-[[Central processing unit|CPU]] architecture and eight processors. Its games are in [[CD-ROM]] format, and its game library contains several [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[Porting|ports]] as well as original games.\n\nDevelopment of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Sega Model 1|Model 1]] [[Arcade system board|arcade hardware]] debuted. The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company [[Hitachi]]. Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with [[Sony]]'s forthcoming [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].\n\nThe Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the [[Nintendo 64]] in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, known in development as ''[[Sonic X-treme]]'', has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.\n\nAlthough the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games, including ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'', the ''[[Panzer Dragoon (series)|Panzer Dragoon]]'' series, and the ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' series, its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited [[third-party developer|third-party]] support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system's development and discontinuation.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nReleased in 1988, the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive in Europe, Japan and Australia) was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|access-date=May 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100219/http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In mid-1990, Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] hired [[Tom Kalinske]] as president and CEO of Sega of America.

He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> He worked as an animator and writer for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' series.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|Larry & Steve]]'', which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an \"old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another\".

He found it easier to develop his own style at ''Johnny Bravo'' through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''Cow and Chicken'', and ''I Am Weasel'' did not use.<ref name=\"ignint\" /> As a part of the ''Johnny Bravo'' crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as [[Adam West]] and [[Jack Sheldon]] of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ''Family Guy'' series.\n\nHe also did freelance work for [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], writing for ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', and for [[Nelvana]], where he wrote for ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ''Ace Ventura'').<ref name=\"ignint\" /> MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ''Zoomates'' for [[Frederator Studios]]' ''[[Oh Yeah!

According to Kiger, Die Glocke is a popular example of such legends and speculation, citing former [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace scientist]] David Myhra's contention that if antigravity devices actually existed, the Germans, desperate to stop the Allies advance, would have used them.<ref name=secret>{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1#ixzz0uXSU8IRo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226104846/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1|archive-date=26 February 2010|publisher=[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|first=Patrick J.|last=Kiger|title=Nazi Secret Weapons|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n*Die Glocke and other purported Nazi ''Wunderwaffen'' have been dramatized in the video game ''[[Call of Duty]]''.<ref name=\"Tack\">{{cite web |last1=Tack |first1=Daniel |title=Bringing The Horror Of Call of Duty: WWII Nazi Zombies To Life |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/08/09/bringing-the-horror-of-call-of-duty-nazi-zombies-to-life.aspx |website=Gameinformer.com |publisher=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=22 December 2019}}</ref> \n*Die Glocke figures in the backstory of the 2006 [[James Rollins]] action-adventure novel ''Black Order''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Rod |date=March 17, 2007 |title=Nazi master race revisited |work=The Mercury |location=Hobart, Australia |page=B9 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYJB\">{{cite web |last1=Fortier |first1=Ron |title=Black Order: A Sigma Force Novel |url=https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/black-order-sigma-force-novel |website=nyjournalofbooks.com |publisher=New York Journal of Books |accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref>\n*Die Glocke was the focus of a 2014 episode of ''[[In Search of Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"Colavito\" /><ref name=\"HC\">{{cite web |title=In Search of Aliens |url=https://www.history.com/shows/in-search-of-aliens/season-1/episode-2 |date=1 August 2014 |website=[[The History Channel]] |publisher=[[A&E Networks]] |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref>  \n*Die Glocke figures in the backstory of the 2013 [[A.
