Formed in 1919, the KMT was formerly the [[Dominant-party system|sole ruling party]] of the Republic of China from 1928 to 2000 and is currently an opposition political party in the [[Legislative Yuan]].\n\nThe predecessor of the Kuomintang, the Revolutionary Alliance ([[Tongmenghui]]), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the subsequent revolt in 1911 and proclamation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. The KMT was founded by [[Song Jiaoren]] and [[Sun Yat-sen]] shortly after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911. Sun was the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional President]], but he later ceded the presidency to [[Yuan Shikai]]. Later led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the KMT formed the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and succeeded in its [[Northern Expedition]] to [[Chinese reunification (1928)|unify]] much of [[mainland China]] in 1928, ending the chaos of the [[Warlord Era]]. It was the ruling party in mainland China until 1949, when it lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the rival [[Communist Party of China]]. The KMT fled to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian [[one-party state]]. This government retained [[China and the United Nations|China's United Nations seat]] (with considerable Western support) until 1971.\n\nTaiwan ceased to be a single-party state in 1986 and political reforms beginning in the 1990s loosened the KMT's grip on power. Nevertheless, the KMT remains one of Taiwan's main political parties, with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|elected in 2008]] and [[2012 Taiwan presidential election|re-elected in 2012]], being the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency. In the [[2016 Taiwan general election|2016 general]] and [[2016 Taiwan presidential election|presidential election]], the KMT was defeated in both elections and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) gained control of both the Legislative Yuan and the presidency, [[Tsai Ing-wen]] being elected President.\n\nThe party's guiding ideology is the [[Three Principles of the People]], advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The KMT is a member of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Together with the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] and [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]], the KMT forms what is known as the Taiwanese [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] which supports eventual [[Chinese unification|unification with the mainland]]. However, the KMT has been forced to moderate its stance by advocating the [[political status of Taiwan|political]] and legal ''status quo'' of modern Taiwan as political realities make the reunification of China unlikely. The KMT holds to the [[one-China policy]] in that it officially considers that there is only one China, but that the Republic of China rather than the [[China|People's Republic of China]] is its legitimate government under the [[1992 Consensus]]. To ease tensions with the PRC, the KMT has since 2008 endorsed the [[Three Noes]] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou, namely no unification, no independence and no use of force.<ref>{{cite news |title=Looking behind Ma's 'three noes' |author=Ralph Cossa |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2008/01/21/2003398185 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Kuomintang}}\n\n=== Founding and Sun Yat-sen era ===\n[[File:The revolutionary army attacks Nanking and crosses a stream Wellcome V0047152.jpg|thumb|left|The Revolutionary Army attacking [[Nanjing]] in 1911]]\n[[File:Dr. Sun in London.jpg|thumb|The KMT reveres its founder, [[Sun Yat-sen]], as the \"Father of the Nation\"]]\nThe KMT traces its ideological and organizational roots to the work of [[Sun Yat-sen]], a proponent of [[Chinese nationalism]] and democracy who founded [[Revive China Society]] at the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]], [[Honolulu]] on 24 November 1894.<ref>See (Chinese) [http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=10 \"Major Events in KMT\" ''History Official Site of the KMT''] last accessed 30 August 2009</ref> In 1905, Sun joined forces with other [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-monarchist societies]] in Tokyo, [[Empire of Japan]] to form the [[Tongmenghui]] on 20 August 1905, a group committed to the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of a republic style government.\n\nThe group planned and supported the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] on 1 January 1912. However, Sun did not have military power and ceded the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional presidency]] of the republic to [[Yuan Shikai]], who arranged for the [[abdication]] of [[Puyi]], the last Emperor, on 12 February.\n\nOn 25 August 1912, the Nationalist Party was established at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing|Peking]], where [[Tongmenghui]] and five smaller pro-revolution parties merged to contest the first national elections.{{sfnp|Strand|2002|pp=59\u201360}} Sun was chosen as the party chairman with [[Huang Xing]] as his deputy.\n\nThe most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the Nationalists to advocate a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The party opposed [[Progressive Party (China)|constitutional monarchists]] and sought to check the power of Yuan. The Nationalists won an overwhelming majority of the first [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|National Assembly election]] in December 1912.\n\nHowever, Yuan soon began to ignore the parliament in making presidential decisions. Song Jiaoren was assassinated in Shanghai in 1913. Members of the Nationalists led by Sun Yat-sen suspected that Yuan was behind the plot and thus staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan, claiming subversiveness and betrayal, expelled adherents of the KMT from the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|parliament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA658 |accessdate=13 June 2011 |year=1922 |publisher=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Company ltd.|page=658 |editor=Hugh Chisholm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Abbe to English history (\"The first of the new volumes\") |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lf9aAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA658 |accessdate=13 June 2011|year=1922|publisher=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Company ltd|page=658}}</ref> Yuan dissolved the Nationalists in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914.\n\n[[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915. While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] on 8 July 1914, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan. To join the Revolutionary Party, members had to take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. As a result, he became largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.\n\nSun returned to China in 1917 to establish a military junta at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to oppose the [[Beiyang government]], but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, under the name Kuomintang of China ({{zh|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8|labels=no}}) and established its headquarters in Canton in 1920.\n\nIn 1923, the KMT and its Canton government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers\u2014the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]]\u2014arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Communist Party of China (CPC) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the [[First United Front]] between the two parties. [[Mao Zedong]] and early members of the CPC also joined the KMT in 1923.\n\n[[File:KMTfirstCongress1924.jpg|thumb|Venue of the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang]] in 1924]]\nSoviet advisers also helped the KMT to set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|first party congress in 1924]] in [[Guangzhou|Kwangchow]], [[Kwangtung]], (Guanzhou, Guangdong) which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CPC, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]] \u2013 nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood.\n\n=== Under Chiang Kai-shek in Mainland China ===\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|left|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the Kuomintang after Sun's death in 1925]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-13-14-22, Tibetexpedition, Haus mit Gl\u00fcckszeichen.jpg|thumb|KMT flag displayed in Lhasa, Tibet in 1938]]\nWhen Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, the political leadership of the KMT fell to [[Wang Jingwei]] and [[Hu Hanmin]], respectively the left-wing and right-wing leaders of the party. However, the real power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. With their military superiority, KMT confirmed their rule on Canton, the provincial capital of [[Kwangtung]]. The Guangxi warlords pledged loyalty to the KMT.

Unlike Sun Yat-sen, whom he admired greatly and who forged all his political, economic, and revolutionary ideas primarily from what he had learned in Hawaii and indirectly through [[British Hong Kong]] and [[Empire of Japan]] under [[Meiji Restoration]], Chiang knew relatively little about the West. He also studied in Japan, but he was firmly rooted in his ancient [[Han Chinese]] identity and was steeped in [[Chinese culture]]. As his life progressed, he became increasingly attached to ancient Chinese culture and traditions. His few trips to the West confirmed his pro-ancient Chinese outlook and he studied the ancient [[Chinese classics]] and ancient Chinese history assiduously.<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/> {{citation needed span|In 1923, Sun Yat-sen sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the political and military system of the Soviet Union.

Sun believed that the only hope for a unified and better China lies in a military conquest, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy. Using this ideology, Chiang built himself into the dictator of the Republic of China, both in the [[Chinese mainland]] and when the [[Government of the Republic of China|national government]] was relocated to [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. With its power confirmed in the southeast, the [[Nationalist Government]] appointed Chiang Kai-shek commander-in-chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), and the [[Northern Expedition]] to suppress the warlords began. Chiang had to defeat three separate warlords and two independent armies. Chiang, with Soviet supplies, conquered the southern half of China in nine months.\n\nA split erupted between the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the KMT, which threatened the Northern Expedition. Wang Jing Wei, who led the KMT leftist allies, took the city of [[Wuhan]] in January 1927. With the support of the Soviet agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanking in March, Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang and his communist allies. Chiang's expulsion of the CPC and their Soviet advisers, marked by the [[Shanghai massacre]] on 12 April, led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang finally surrendered his power to Chiang. [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to obey the KMT leadership.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Once this split had been healed, Chiang resumed his Northern Expedition and managed to take Shanghai.<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/>\n\n[[File:Countermand concession.jpg|thumb|The [[National Revolutionary Army]] soldiers marched into the British concessions in [[Hankou]] during the [[Northern Expedition]]]]\nDuring the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]] in March 1927, the NRA stormed the consulates of the United States, United Kingdom (UK) and [[Empire of Japan]], looted foreign properties and almost assassinated the Japanese consul.

The city was the internationally recognized capital, even when it was previously controlled by warlords. This event allowed the KMT to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Peking to Nanking, the original capital of the [[Ming dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 was relatively stable and prosperous and is still known as the [[Nanjing decade]].\n\nAfter the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, the [[Nationalist government]] under the KMT declared that China had been exploited for decades under the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] signed between the foreign powers and the Qing Dynasty. The KMT government demanded that the foreign powers renegotiate the treaties on equal terms.<ref>{{cite news|title=CHINA: Nationalist Notes|work=Time|date=25 June 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore the Northern Expedition, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial autonomy. However, the KMT under Chiang's leadership aimed at establishing a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of \"political tutelage\", whereby the party was to lead the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. The topic of reorganizing the army, brought up at a military conference in 1929, sparked the [[Central Plains War]]. The cliques, some of them former warlords, demanded to retain their army and political power within their own territories. Although Chiang finally won the war, the conflicts among the cliques would have a devastating effect on the survival of the KMT.

At the same time, the CPC had been secretly recruiting new members within the KMT government and military. Chiang was alarmed by the expansion of the communist influence. He believed that to fight against foreign aggression, the KMT must solve its internal conflicts first, so he started his second attempt to exterminate CPC members in 1934. With the advice from German military advisors, the KMT forced the Communists to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known as the [[Long March]]. Less than 10% of the communist army survived the long retreat to Shaanxi province, but they re-established their military base quickly with aid from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe KMT was also known to have used terror tactics against suspected communists, through the use of a secret police force, who were employed to maintain surveillance on suspected communists and political opponents. In ''The Birth of Communist China'', C.P. Fitzgerald describes China under the rule of the KMT thus: \"the Chinese people groaned under a regime Fascist in every quality except efficiency.\"<ref>C.P.

However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. Conflicts between KMT and CPC were still common during the war, and documented claims abound of CPC attacks upon the KMT forces and vice versa.\n\nWhile the KMT army received heavy casualties fighting the Japanese, the CPC expanded its territory by guerrilla tactics within Japanese occupied regions, leading some{{Who|date=February 2016}} claims that the CPC often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-ccp-didnt-fight-imperial-japan-the-kmt-did/|title=The CCP Didn't Fight Imperial Japan; the KMT Did|last=Diplomat|first=Zachary Keck|work=The Diplomat|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:19451025 \u4e2d\u570b\u6230\u5340\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u53d7\u964d\u5178\u79ae\u5f8c \u81fa\u7063\u7701\u8b66\u5099\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5168\u9ad4\u5b98\u5175\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] in [[Taipei]] on 25 October 1945]]\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] in 1945, [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan was returned]] to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945. The brief period of celebration was soon shadowed by the possibility of a civil war between the KMT and CPC. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan just before it surrendered and occupied [[Manchuria]], the north eastern part of China. The Soviet Union denied the KMT army the right to enter the region and allowed the CPC to take control of the Japanese factories and their supplies.\n\nFull-scale civil war between the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and the [[Nationalist government|Nationalists]] erupted in 1946. The Communist Chinese armies, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part. First, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the PLA. Second, the KMT government proved thoroughly unable to manage the economy, allowing hyperinflation to result. Among the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Gold Standard Scrip]]<!--Note: this is not a typo, do not change to \"Script\"--> in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Scrip in exchange. As most farmland in the north were under CPC's control, the cities governed by the KMT lacked food supply and this added to the hyperinflation. The new scrip became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of the KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave CPC a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States (US). However, with the country suffering from [[hyperinflation]], widespread corruption and other economic ills, the KMT continued to lose popular support. Some leading officials and military leaders of the KMT hoarded material, armament and military-aid funding provided by the US. This became an issue which proved to be a hindrance of its relationship with [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]. US President [[Harry S. Truman]] wrote that \"[[Chiang family|the Chiangs]], [[HH Kung|the Kungs]] and [[Soong sisters|the Soongs]] (were) all thieves\", having taken $750&nbsp;million in US aid.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wesley Marvin Bagby|title=The Eagle-Dragon Alliance: America's Relations With China in World War II|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87413-418-6|page=65}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the PLA cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the CPC side, and the overwhelming popular support for the CPC in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists.\n\nBy the end of 1949, the CPC controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to Taiwan with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] of the People's Republic of China.\n\n=== In Taiwan since 1945 ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n{{see also|North\u2013South divide in Taiwan}}\n[[File:KMT Headquarters, Taipei.JPG|thumb|The former KMT headquarters in [[Taipei City]] (1949\u20132006), whose imposing structure, directly facing the [[Presidential Office Building]], was seen as a symbol of the party's wealth and dominance]]\nIn 1895, Formosa (now called Taiwan), including the [[Penghu]] islands, became a Japanese colony via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nAfter Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan to surrender its troops in Taiwan to Chiang Kai-shek. On 25 October 1945, KMT general [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] acted on behalf of the Allied Powers to accept Japan's surrender and proclaimed that day as [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan Retrocession Day]].\n\nTensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] from Mainland China increased in the intervening years, culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer in front of [[Tianma Tea House]] triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days. The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]]. As a result of the 28 February Incident in 1947, Taiwanese people endured what is called the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\", a KMT-led political repression that resulted in the death or disappearance of over 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.<ref>[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=5B33122680FD5E65A32B8E335FE5727A \"Ceremonies held to commemorate 228 Incident victims (2014/02/28)\"].

The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the CPC. The KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists. The slogan was \"prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year.\" Chiang also initiated the [[Project National Glory]] to retake back the mainland in 1965, but was eventually dropped in July 1972 after many unsuccessful attempts.\n\nHowever, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the CPC full-scale. The KMT backed Muslim insurgents formerly belonging to the [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950\u201358)|KMT Islamic insurgency in 1950\u20131958]] in Mainland China. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]], that were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government, actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The Republic of China in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.\n\nUntil the 1970s, the KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved [[Cross-Strait relations|relations between Taiwan and the mainland]] and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However, the KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as Nationalist China after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for \"supplemental elections\" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]].\n\nAlthough opposition parties were not permitted, [[Tangwai]] (\"outside the KMT\") representatives were tolerated. In the 1980s, the KMT focused on transforming the government from a single-party system to a [[multi-party]] democratic one and embracing \"[[Taiwanization]]\". With the founding of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) on 28 September 1986, the KMT started competing against the DPP in Parliamentary elections.\n\nIn 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected President and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of \"special state-to-state relations\" with the PRC. The PRC associated this idea with [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]].\n\nThe KMT faced a split in 1993 that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] in August 1993, alleged to be a result of Lee's \"corruptive ruling style\". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into the KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] (PFP) on 31 March 2000. The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. To prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU) by Lee supporters on 24 July 2001.\n\n[[File:Pan-blue supporters during 2004 ROC presidential election with ROC flags.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-blue]] supporters at a rally during the [[2004 Republic of China presidential election|2004 presidential election]]]]\nPrior to this, the party's voters had defected to both the PFP and TSU, and the KMT did poorly in the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|December 2001 legislative elections]] and lost its position as the largest party in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. However, the party did well in the 2002 local government mayoral and council election with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], its candidate for Taipei mayor, winning reelection by a landslide and its candidate for [[Kaohsiung]] mayor narrowly losing but doing surprisingly well. Since 2002, the KMT and PFP have coordinated electoral strategies. In 2004, the KMT and PFP ran a joint presidential ticket, with Lien running for president and Soong running for vice-president.\n\nThe loss of the presidential election of 2004 to DPP President [[Chen Shui-bian]] by merely over 30,000 votes was a bitter disappointment to party members, leading to large scale rallies for several weeks protesting alleged electoral fraud and the \"odd circumstances\" of the [[3-19 shooting incident|shooting of President Chen]]. However, the fortunes of the party were greatly improved when the KMT did well in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held in December 2004 by maintaining its support in southern Taiwan achieving a majority for the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]].\n\nSoon after the election, there appeared to be a falling out with the KMT's junior partner, the People First Party and talk of a merger seemed to have ended. This split appeared to widen in early 2005, as the leader of the PFP, James Soong appeared to be reconciling with President [[Chen Shui-Bian]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. Many PFP members including legislators and municipal leaders have defected to the KMT, and the PFP is seen as a fading party.\n\nIn 2005, Ma Ying-jeou became KMT chairman defeating speaker [[Wang Jin-pyng]] in the [[2005 Kuomintang chairmanship election|first public election for KMT chairmanship]]. The KMT won a decisive victory in the [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|3-in-1 local elections]] of December 2005, replacing the DPP as the largest party at the local level. This was seen as a major victory for the party ahead of legislative elections in 2007. There were elections for the two municipalities of the ROC, Taipei and [[Kaohsiung]] on December 2006. The KMT won a clear victory in Taipei, but lost to the DPP in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]] by the slim margin of 1,100 votes.\n\nOn 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11&nbsp;million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of \"special expenses\" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as KMT chairman at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for ROC President. Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties. In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors. In 2008, the KMT won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|Republic of China Presidential Election on 22 March 2008]]. The KMT fielded former Taipei mayor and former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to run against the DPP's Frank Hsieh. Ma won by a margin of 17% against Hsieh. Ma took office on 20 May 2008, with Vice-Presidential candidate Vincent Siew, and ended 8 years of the DPP presidency. The KMT also won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan legislative election|2008 legislative elections]], winning 81 of 113 seats, or 71.7% of seats in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. These two elections gave the KMT firm control of both the executive and legislative yuans.\n\nOn 25 June 2009, President Ma launched his bid to regain KMT's leadership and registered as the sole candidate for the [[2009 Kuomintang chairmanship election|election of the KMT chairmanship]]. On 26 July, Ma won 93.87% of the vote, becoming the new chairman of the KMT,<ref>[http://english.cna.com.tw/ReadNews/Detail.aspx?pSearchDate=&pNewsID=200907270004&pType1=PD&pType0=xPDCS&pTypeSel=0 President Ma elected KMT chairman] \u2013 CNA ENGLISH NEWS</ref> taking office on 17 October 2009.

However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. During the 2000\u20132008 DPP presidency, a law was proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government. However, due to the DPP's lack of control of the legislative chamber at the time, it never materialised.\n\nThe KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to \"retro-endow\" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate. DPP, in its capacity as ruling party from 2000 to 2008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.\n\n[[File:Shilin Division, Kuomintang Taipei City Committee 20161231.jpg|thumb|Kuomintang public service centre in Shilin, Taipei]]\nIn 2006, the KMT sold its headquarters at 11 Zhongshan South Road in [[Taipei]] to [[Evergreen Group]] for [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]2.3&nbsp;billion (US$96&nbsp;million).

Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to \"immediate independence\", it did not wish to be classed as \"pro-reunificationist\" either.\n\nAt the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the 2004 presidential election, said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's \"eventual independence\". This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relations was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.\n\nHowever, there had been a warming of relations between the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in Shanghai targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.\n\nIn 2005, then-party chairman Lien Chan announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position included [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and Wang Jin-pyng. On 5 April 2005, [[Mayor of Taipei|Taipei Mayor]] Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition KMT with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[2005 KMT chairmanship election|first contested leadership in KMT's 93-year history]]. Some 54% of the party's 1.04&nbsp;million members cast their ballots. Ma garnered 72.4% of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against Wang's 27.6%, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]], [[Chiang Pin-kung]] and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] ({{lang|zh|\u6797\u6f84\u679d}}), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] as vice-chairmen. All appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.\n\n[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lien Chan]] (middle) and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (second left) and the KMT touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], People's Republic of China when the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005]]\nOn 28 March 2005, thirty members of the KMT, led by vice-chairman Chiang Pin-kung, [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]]. This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. <!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--> During the trip, the KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The opponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation, after the [[First United Front|First]] and [[Second United Front]]. Weeks afterwards, in May 2005, Chairman Lien Chan visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. This marked the first meeting between leaders of the KMT and CPC after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. No agreements were signed because incumbent [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of [[Law of the Republic of China|ROC laws]] prohibiting citizens from collaborating with CPC.\n\n== Supporter base ==\nSupport for the KMT in Taiwan encompasses a wide range of groups. KMT support tends to be higher in northern Taiwan and in urban areas, where it draws its backing from big businesses due to its policy of maintaining commercial links with mainland China.\n\nThe KMT also has strong support in the labor sector because of the many labor benefits and insurance implemented while the KMT was in power. The KMT traditionally has strong cooperation with military officers, teachers, and government workers. Among the ethnic groups in Taiwan, the KMT has stronger support among [[Mainland Chinese#Mainlanders in Taiwan|mainlanders]] and their descendants, for ideological reasons, and among [[Taiwanese aboriginals]]. The support for the KMT generally tend to be stronger in majority-[[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties of Taiwan, in contrast to the [[Hokkien]]-majority southwestern counties that tend to support the [[Democratic Progressive Party]].\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities effective KMT networks, contribute to Aboriginal skepticism towards the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals' tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the \"indigenization\" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's \"rectification\" by recognizing the Taroko for political reasons, with the majority of mountain townships voting for [[Ma Ying-jeou]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOusAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false Simon 2011], p. 28.</ref> In 2005 the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of the anti-Japanese Aboriginal leader [[Mona Rudao]] at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession from Japan to the Republic of China.<ref>{{cite news|date=26 October 2005 |script-title=zh:\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8\u7d00\u5ff5\u5149\u5fa9\u7a31\u83ab\u90a3\u9b6f\u9053\u6297\u65e5\u82f1\u96c4 |url= http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-80741 |newspaper=[[:zh:\u53f0\u6e7e\u7acb\u62a5|Lihpao]] |language=zh-hant }}</ref>\n\nFor social issues, the KMT doesn't take an official position on [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]], though most members of legislative committees, mayor of cities, and the most recent presidential candidate ([[Han Kuo-yu]]) oppose.

Formed in 1919, the KMT was formerly the [[Dominant-party system|sole ruling party]] of the Republic of China from 1928 to 2000 and is currently an opposition political party in the [[Legislative Yuan]].\n\nThe predecessor of the Kuomintang, the Revolutionary Alliance ([[Tongmenghui]]), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the subsequent revolt in 1911 and proclamation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. The KMT was founded by [[Song Jiaoren]] and [[Sun Yat-sen]] shortly after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911. Sun was the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional President]], but he later ceded the presidency to [[Yuan Shikai]]. Later led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the KMT formed the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and succeeded in its [[Northern Expedition]] to [[Chinese reunification (1928)|unify]] much of [[mainland China]] in 1928, ending the chaos of the [[Warlord Era]]. It was the ruling party in mainland China until 1949, when it lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the rival [[Communist Party of China]]. The KMT fled to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian [[one-party state]]. This government retained [[China and the United Nations|China's United Nations seat]] (with considerable Western support) until 1971.\n\nTaiwan ceased to be a single-party state in 1986 and political reforms beginning in the 1990s loosened the KMT's grip on power. Nevertheless, the KMT remains one of Taiwan's main political parties, with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|elected in 2008]] and [[2012 Taiwan presidential election|re-elected in 2012]], being the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency. In the [[2016 Taiwan general election|2016 general]] and [[2016 Taiwan presidential election|presidential election]], the KMT was defeated in both elections and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) gained control of both the Legislative Yuan and the presidency, [[Tsai Ing-wen]] being elected President.\n\nThe party's guiding ideology is the [[Three Principles of the People]], advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The KMT is a member of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Together with the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] and [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]], the KMT forms what is known as the Taiwanese [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] which supports eventual [[Chinese unification|unification with the mainland]]. However, the KMT has been forced to moderate its stance by advocating the [[political status of Taiwan|political]] and legal ''status quo'' of modern Taiwan as political realities make the reunification of China unlikely. The KMT holds to the [[one-China policy]] in that it officially considers that there is only one China, but that the Republic of China rather than the [[China|People's Republic of China]] is its legitimate government under the [[1992 Consensus]]. To ease tensions with the PRC, the KMT has since 2008 endorsed the [[Three Noes]] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou, namely no unification, no independence and no use of force.<ref>{{cite news |title=Looking behind Ma's 'three noes' |author=Ralph Cossa |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2008/01/21/2003398185 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Kuomintang}}\n\n=== Founding and Sun Yat-sen era ===\n[[File:The revolutionary army attacks Nanking and crosses a stream Wellcome V0047152.jpg|thumb|left|The Revolutionary Army attacking [[Nanjing]] in 1911]]\n[[File:Dr. Sun in London.jpg|thumb|The KMT reveres its founder, [[Sun Yat-sen]], as the \"Father of the Nation\"]]\nThe KMT traces its ideological and organizational roots to the work of [[Sun Yat-sen]], a proponent of [[Chinese nationalism]] and democracy who founded [[Revive China Society]] at the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]], [[Honolulu]] on 24 November 1894.<ref>See (Chinese) [http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=10 \"Major Events in KMT\" ''History Official Site of the KMT''] last accessed 30 August 2009</ref> In 1905, Sun joined forces with other [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-monarchist societies]] in Tokyo, [[Empire of Japan]] to form the [[Tongmenghui]] on 20 August 1905, a group committed to the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of a republic style government.\n\nThe group planned and supported the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] on 1 January 1912. However, Sun did not have military power and ceded the [[President of the Republic of China|provisional presidency]] of the republic to [[Yuan Shikai]], who arranged for the [[abdication]] of [[Puyi]], the last Emperor, on 12 February.\n\nOn 25 August 1912, the Nationalist Party was established at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing|Peking]], where [[Tongmenghui]] and five smaller pro-revolution parties merged to contest the first national elections.{{sfnp|Strand|2002|pp=59\u201360}} Sun was chosen as the party chairman with [[Huang Xing]] as his deputy.\n\nThe most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the Nationalists to advocate a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The party opposed [[Progressive Party (China)|constitutional monarchists]] and sought to check the power of Yuan. The Nationalists won an overwhelming majority of the first [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|National Assembly election]] in December 1912.\n\nHowever, Yuan soon began to ignore the parliament in making presidential decisions. Song Jiaoren was assassinated in Shanghai in 1913. Members of the Nationalists led by Sun Yat-sen suspected that Yuan was behind the plot and thus staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan, claiming subversiveness and betrayal, expelled adherents of the KMT from the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|parliament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA658 |accessdate=13 June 2011 |year=1922 |publisher=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Company ltd.|page=658 |editor=Hugh Chisholm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Abbe to English history (\"The first of the new volumes\") |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lf9aAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA658 |accessdate=13 June 2011|year=1922|publisher=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Company ltd|page=658}}</ref> Yuan dissolved the Nationalists in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914.\n\n[[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915. While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] on 8 July 1914, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan. To join the Revolutionary Party, members had to take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. As a result, he became largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.\n\nSun returned to China in 1917 to establish a military junta at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to oppose the [[Beiyang government]], but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, under the name Kuomintang of China ({{zh|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8|labels=no}}) and established its headquarters in Canton in 1920.\n\nIn 1923, the KMT and its Canton government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers\u2014the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]]\u2014arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Communist Party of China (CPC) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the [[First United Front]] between the two parties. [[Mao Zedong]] and early members of the CPC also joined the KMT in 1923.\n\n[[File:KMTfirstCongress1924.jpg|thumb|Venue of the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang]] in 1924]]\nSoviet advisers also helped the KMT to set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|first party congress in 1924]] in [[Guangzhou|Kwangchow]], [[Kwangtung]], (Guanzhou, Guangdong) which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CPC, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]] \u2013 nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood.\n\n=== Under Chiang Kai-shek in Mainland China ===\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|left|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the Kuomintang after Sun's death in 1925]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-13-14-22, Tibetexpedition, Haus mit Gl\u00fcckszeichen.jpg|thumb|KMT flag displayed in Lhasa, Tibet in 1938]]\nWhen Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, the political leadership of the KMT fell to [[Wang Jingwei]] and [[Hu Hanmin]], respectively the left-wing and right-wing leaders of the party. However, the real power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. With their military superiority, KMT confirmed their rule on Canton, the provincial capital of [[Kwangtung]]. The Guangxi warlords pledged loyalty to the KMT. The KMT now became a rival government in opposition to the [[Warlord era|warlord]] [[Beiyang government]] based in [[Beijing|Peking]].<ref name=\"Nationalist China\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MODCHINA/NATIONAL.HTM|title=Nationalist China|publisher=Washington State University|date=6 June 1996|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906095406/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MODCHINA/NATIONAL.HTM|archivedate=6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nChiang assumed [[List of leaders of the Kuomintang|leadership]] of the KMT on 6 July 1926. Unlike Sun Yat-sen, whom he admired greatly and who forged all his political, economic, and revolutionary ideas primarily from what he had learned in Hawaii and indirectly through [[British Hong Kong]] and [[Empire of Japan]] under [[Meiji Restoration]], Chiang knew relatively little about the West. He also studied in Japan, but he was firmly rooted in his ancient [[Han Chinese]] identity and was steeped in [[Chinese culture]]. As his life progressed, he became increasingly attached to ancient Chinese culture and traditions. His few trips to the West confirmed his pro-ancient Chinese outlook and he studied the ancient [[Chinese classics]] and ancient Chinese history assiduously.<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/> {{citation needed span|In 1923, Sun Yat-sen sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the political and military system of the Soviet Union. Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Soviet [[communist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] model of government was not suitable for China. This laid the beginning of his lifelong antagonism against [[communism]].|date=March 2020|reason=As with all material on the Wikipedia website, a citation is actually required here.}}\n\nChiang was also particularly committed to Sun's idea of \"political tutelage\". Sun believed that the only hope for a unified and better China lies in a military conquest, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy. Using this ideology, Chiang built himself into the dictator of the Republic of China, both in the [[Chinese mainland]] and when the [[Government of the Republic of China|national government]] was relocated to [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. With its power confirmed in the southeast, the [[Nationalist Government]] appointed Chiang Kai-shek commander-in-chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), and the [[Northern Expedition]] to suppress the warlords began. Chiang had to defeat three separate warlords and two independent armies. Chiang, with Soviet supplies, conquered the southern half of China in nine months.\n\nA split erupted between the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the KMT, which threatened the Northern Expedition. Wang Jing Wei, who led the KMT leftist allies, took the city of [[Wuhan]] in January 1927. With the support of the Soviet agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanking in March, Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang and his communist allies. Chiang's expulsion of the CPC and their Soviet advisers, marked by the [[Shanghai massacre]] on 12 April, led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang finally surrendered his power to Chiang. [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to obey the KMT leadership.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Once this split had been healed, Chiang resumed his Northern Expedition and managed to take Shanghai.<ref name=\"Nationalist China\"/>\n\n[[File:Countermand concession.jpg|thumb|The [[National Revolutionary Army]] soldiers marched into the British concessions in [[Hankou]] during the [[Northern Expedition]]]]\nDuring the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]] in March 1927, the NRA stormed the consulates of the United States, United Kingdom (UK) and [[Empire of Japan]], looted foreign properties and almost assassinated the Japanese consul.

The city was the internationally recognized capital, even when it was previously controlled by warlords. This event allowed the KMT to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Peking to Nanking, the original capital of the [[Ming dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 was relatively stable and prosperous and is still known as the [[Nanjing decade]].\n\nAfter the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, the [[Nationalist government]] under the KMT declared that China had been exploited for decades under the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] signed between the foreign powers and the Qing Dynasty. The KMT government demanded that the foreign powers renegotiate the treaties on equal terms.<ref>{{cite news|title=CHINA: Nationalist Notes|work=Time|date=25 June 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786420,00.html|accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore the Northern Expedition, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial autonomy. However, the KMT under Chiang's leadership aimed at establishing a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of \"political tutelage\", whereby the party was to lead the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. The topic of reorganizing the army, brought up at a military conference in 1929, sparked the [[Central Plains War]]. The cliques, some of them former warlords, demanded to retain their army and political power within their own territories. Although Chiang finally won the war, the conflicts among the cliques would have a devastating effect on the survival of the KMT.

At the same time, the CPC had been secretly recruiting new members within the KMT government and military. Chiang was alarmed by the expansion of the communist influence. He believed that to fight against foreign aggression, the KMT must solve its internal conflicts first, so he started his second attempt to exterminate CPC members in 1934. With the advice from German military advisors, the KMT forced the Communists to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known as the [[Long March]]. Less than 10% of the communist army survived the long retreat to Shaanxi province, but they re-established their military base quickly with aid from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe KMT was also known to have used terror tactics against suspected communists, through the use of a secret police force, who were employed to maintain surveillance on suspected communists and political opponents. In ''The Birth of Communist China'', C.P. Fitzgerald describes China under the rule of the KMT thus: \"the Chinese people groaned under a regime Fascist in every quality except efficiency.\"<ref>C.P.

However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. Conflicts between KMT and CPC were still common during the war, and documented claims abound of CPC attacks upon the KMT forces and vice versa.\n\nWhile the KMT army received heavy casualties fighting the Japanese, the CPC expanded its territory by guerrilla tactics within Japanese occupied regions, leading some{{Who|date=February 2016}} claims that the CPC often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-ccp-didnt-fight-imperial-japan-the-kmt-did/|title=The CCP Didn't Fight Imperial Japan; the KMT Did|last=Diplomat|first=Zachary Keck|work=The Diplomat|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:19451025 \u4e2d\u570b\u6230\u5340\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u53d7\u964d\u5178\u79ae\u5f8c \u81fa\u7063\u7701\u8b66\u5099\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5168\u9ad4\u5b98\u5175\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] in [[Taipei]] on 25 October 1945]]\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] in 1945, [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan was returned]] to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945. The brief period of celebration was soon shadowed by the possibility of a civil war between the KMT and CPC. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan just before it surrendered and occupied [[Manchuria]], the north eastern part of China. The Soviet Union denied the KMT army the right to enter the region and allowed the CPC to take control of the Japanese factories and their supplies.\n\nFull-scale civil war between the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and the [[Nationalist government|Nationalists]] erupted in 1946. The Communist Chinese armies, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part. First, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the PLA. Second, the KMT government proved thoroughly unable to manage the economy, allowing hyperinflation to result. Among the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Gold Standard Scrip]]<!--Note: this is not a typo, do not change to \"Script\"--> in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Scrip in exchange. As most farmland in the north were under CPC's control, the cities governed by the KMT lacked food supply and this added to the hyperinflation. The new scrip became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of the KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave CPC a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States (US). However, with the country suffering from [[hyperinflation]], widespread corruption and other economic ills, the KMT continued to lose popular support. Some leading officials and military leaders of the KMT hoarded material, armament and military-aid funding provided by the US. This became an issue which proved to be a hindrance of its relationship with [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]. US President [[Harry S. Truman]] wrote that \"[[Chiang family|the Chiangs]], [[HH Kung|the Kungs]] and [[Soong sisters|the Soongs]] (were) all thieves\", having taken $750&nbsp;million in US aid.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wesley Marvin Bagby|title=The Eagle-Dragon Alliance: America's Relations With China in World War II|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87413-418-6|page=65}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the PLA cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the CPC side, and the overwhelming popular support for the CPC in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists.\n\nBy the end of 1949, the CPC controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to Taiwan with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] of the People's Republic of China.\n\n=== In Taiwan since 1945 ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n{{see also|North\u2013South divide in Taiwan}}\n[[File:KMT Headquarters, Taipei.JPG|thumb|The former KMT headquarters in [[Taipei City]] (1949\u20132006), whose imposing structure, directly facing the [[Presidential Office Building]], was seen as a symbol of the party's wealth and dominance]]\nIn 1895, Formosa (now called Taiwan), including the [[Penghu]] islands, became a Japanese colony via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nAfter Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan to surrender its troops in Taiwan to Chiang Kai-shek. On 25 October 1945, KMT general [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] acted on behalf of the Allied Powers to accept Japan's surrender and proclaimed that day as [[Retrocession Day|Taiwan Retrocession Day]].\n\nTensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] from Mainland China increased in the intervening years, culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer in front of [[Tianma Tea House]] triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days. The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]]. As a result of the 28 February Incident in 1947, Taiwanese people endured what is called the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\", a KMT-led political repression that resulted in the death or disappearance of over 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.<ref>[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=5B33122680FD5E65A32B8E335FE5727A \"Ceremonies held to commemorate 228 Incident victims (2014/02/28)\"].

The KMT fought the [[Battle of Guningtou]] on 25\u201327 October 1949 and stopped the PLA invasion.

The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the CPC. The KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists. The slogan was \"prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year.\" Chiang also initiated the [[Project National Glory]] to retake back the mainland in 1965, but was eventually dropped in July 1972 after many unsuccessful attempts.\n\nHowever, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the CPC full-scale. The KMT backed Muslim insurgents formerly belonging to the [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950\u201358)|KMT Islamic insurgency in 1950\u20131958]] in Mainland China. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]], that were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government, actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The Republic of China in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.\n\nUntil the 1970s, the KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved [[Cross-Strait relations|relations between Taiwan and the mainland]] and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However, the KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as Nationalist China after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for \"supplemental elections\" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]].\n\nAlthough opposition parties were not permitted, [[Tangwai]] (\"outside the KMT\") representatives were tolerated. In the 1980s, the KMT focused on transforming the government from a single-party system to a [[multi-party]] democratic one and embracing \"[[Taiwanization]]\". With the founding of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) on 28 September 1986, the KMT started competing against the DPP in Parliamentary elections.\n\nIn 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected President and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of \"special state-to-state relations\" with the PRC. The PRC associated this idea with [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]].\n\nThe KMT faced a split in 1993 that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] in August 1993, alleged to be a result of Lee's \"corruptive ruling style\". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into the KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] (PFP) on 31 March 2000. The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. To prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU) by Lee supporters on 24 July 2001.\n\n[[File:Pan-blue supporters during 2004 ROC presidential election with ROC flags.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-blue]] supporters at a rally during the [[2004 Republic of China presidential election|2004 presidential election]]]]\nPrior to this, the party's voters had defected to both the PFP and TSU, and the KMT did poorly in the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|December 2001 legislative elections]] and lost its position as the largest party in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. However, the party did well in the 2002 local government mayoral and council election with [[Ma Ying-jeou]], its candidate for Taipei mayor, winning reelection by a landslide and its candidate for [[Kaohsiung]] mayor narrowly losing but doing surprisingly well. Since 2002, the KMT and PFP have coordinated electoral strategies. In 2004, the KMT and PFP ran a joint presidential ticket, with Lien running for president and Soong running for vice-president.\n\nThe loss of the presidential election of 2004 to DPP President [[Chen Shui-bian]] by merely over 30,000 votes was a bitter disappointment to party members, leading to large scale rallies for several weeks protesting alleged electoral fraud and the \"odd circumstances\" of the [[3-19 shooting incident|shooting of President Chen]]. However, the fortunes of the party were greatly improved when the KMT did well in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held in December 2004 by maintaining its support in southern Taiwan achieving a majority for the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]].\n\nSoon after the election, there appeared to be a falling out with the KMT's junior partner, the People First Party and talk of a merger seemed to have ended. This split appeared to widen in early 2005, as the leader of the PFP, James Soong appeared to be reconciling with President [[Chen Shui-Bian]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. Many PFP members including legislators and municipal leaders have defected to the KMT, and the PFP is seen as a fading party.\n\nIn 2005, Ma Ying-jeou became KMT chairman defeating speaker [[Wang Jin-pyng]] in the [[2005 Kuomintang chairmanship election|first public election for KMT chairmanship]]. The KMT won a decisive victory in the [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|3-in-1 local elections]] of December 2005, replacing the DPP as the largest party at the local level. This was seen as a major victory for the party ahead of legislative elections in 2007. There were elections for the two municipalities of the ROC, Taipei and [[Kaohsiung]] on December 2006. The KMT won a clear victory in Taipei, but lost to the DPP in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]] by the slim margin of 1,100 votes.\n\nOn 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11&nbsp;million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of \"special expenses\" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as KMT chairman at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for ROC President. Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties. In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors. In 2008, the KMT won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|Republic of China Presidential Election on 22 March 2008]]. The KMT fielded former Taipei mayor and former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to run against the DPP's Frank Hsieh. Ma won by a margin of 17% against Hsieh. Ma took office on 20 May 2008, with Vice-Presidential candidate Vincent Siew, and ended 8 years of the DPP presidency. The KMT also won a landslide victory in the [[2008 Taiwan legislative election|2008 legislative elections]], winning 81 of 113 seats, or 71.7% of seats in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. These two elections gave the KMT firm control of both the executive and legislative yuans.\n\nOn 25 June 2009, President Ma launched his bid to regain KMT's leadership and registered as the sole candidate for the [[2009 Kuomintang chairmanship election|election of the KMT chairmanship]]. On 26 July, Ma won 93.87% of the vote, becoming the new chairman of the KMT,<ref>[http://english.cna.com.tw/ReadNews/Detail.aspx?pSearchDate=&pNewsID=200907270004&pType1=PD&pType0=xPDCS&pTypeSel=0 President Ma elected KMT chairman] \u2013 CNA ENGLISH NEWS</ref> taking office on 17 October 2009.

However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. During the 2000\u20132008 DPP presidency, a law was proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government. However, due to the DPP's lack of control of the legislative chamber at the time, it never materialised.\n\nThe KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to \"retro-endow\" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate. DPP, in its capacity as ruling party from 2000 to 2008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.\n\n[[File:Shilin Division, Kuomintang Taipei City Committee 20161231.jpg|thumb|Kuomintang public service centre in Shilin, Taipei]]\nIn 2006, the KMT sold its headquarters at 11 Zhongshan South Road in [[Taipei]] to [[Evergreen Group]] for [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]2.3&nbsp;billion (US$96&nbsp;million).

Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to \"immediate independence\", it did not wish to be classed as \"pro-reunificationist\" either.\n\nAt the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the 2004 presidential election, said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's \"eventual independence\". This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relations was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.\n\nHowever, there had been a warming of relations between the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in Shanghai targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.\n\nIn 2005, then-party chairman Lien Chan announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position included [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and Wang Jin-pyng. On 5 April 2005, [[Mayor of Taipei|Taipei Mayor]] Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition KMT with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[2005 KMT chairmanship election|first contested leadership in KMT's 93-year history]]. Some 54% of the party's 1.04&nbsp;million members cast their ballots. Ma garnered 72.4% of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against Wang's 27.6%, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]], [[Chiang Pin-kung]] and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] ({{lang|zh|\u6797\u6f84\u679d}}), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] as vice-chairmen. All appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.\n\n[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lien Chan]] (middle) and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (second left) and the KMT touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], People's Republic of China when the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005]]\nOn 28 March 2005, thirty members of the KMT, led by vice-chairman Chiang Pin-kung, [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]]. This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. <!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--> During the trip, the KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The opponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation, after the [[First United Front|First]] and [[Second United Front]]. Weeks afterwards, in May 2005, Chairman Lien Chan visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. This marked the first meeting between leaders of the KMT and CPC after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. No agreements were signed because incumbent [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of [[Law of the Republic of China|ROC laws]] prohibiting citizens from collaborating with CPC.\n\n== Supporter base ==\nSupport for the KMT in Taiwan encompasses a wide range of groups. KMT support tends to be higher in northern Taiwan and in urban areas, where it draws its backing from big businesses due to its policy of maintaining commercial links with mainland China.\n\nThe KMT also has strong support in the labor sector because of the many labor benefits and insurance implemented while the KMT was in power.

One of the first atrocities of his reign was the murder of [[Raja Kesavadas]],<ref>P. Shungunny Menon. History of Travancore. Page 245.</ref> the then [[Dewan]] of Travancore. Sankaran Nampoothiri was subsequently appointed Dewan or Prime Minister assisted by two other ministers. The state treasury was soon empty due to corruption so it was decided to collect money by ordering the [[tahsildar]]s (district officers) to pay large amounts of money which were determined without any reference to the revenue of the districts. Velu Thampi, the [[Tahasildar]](Karyakar) of a southern district, was ordered to pay Rs. 3000 to which he responded that he needed three days to pay. Velu Thampi returned to his district, gathered the people and an uprising ensued. People from all parts of Travancore united to surround the palace and demand the immediate dismissal and banishment of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri. They also demanded that his two ministers ([[Thachil Matthoo Tharakan|Matthoo Tharakan]],Sankaranarayanan chetty) be brought to a public place then undergo flogging and have their ears cut off. The punishments were duly carried out and the two ministers were put in jail at [[Trivandrum]]. Velu Thampi was later appointed the Dalawa of Travancore.<ref>P. Shungunny Menon. Thiruvithancore Charitram. (History of Travancore). Page 245-251.</ref>\n\n==Career as Dalawa==\n[[Image:Dalava.jpg|thumb|200px|Sculpture of Velu Thampy Dalawa in the Secretariat campus, [[Thiruvananthapuram]]]]\nAfter Velu Thampi became Dalawa of Travancore he faced serious opposition from two relatives of the late Raja Kesavadas who sought assistance to get rid of him from their associates in [[Bombay]]. These letters were intercepted and presented to the Maharajah in a negative light and he ordered the immediate execution of the two men, Chempakaraman Kumaran Pillai and Erayiman Pillai. Having cleared the way, Velu Thampi became Dalawa with no opposition. The [[Madras Presidency|Madras Government]] sanctioned his appointment within a few months.\n\nVelu Thampi was not an able statesman like [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] or Raja Kesavadas, his immediate two predecessors. He was of rebellious nature. Within three years of the death of Raja Kesavadas the country was plagued with corruption and various problems caused by the banished Namboodiri Dalawa. Velu Thampi resorted to harsh punishments with a view to improve the situation. Flogging, cutting off of ears and noses as well as nailing people to trees were some of the punishments adopted during his term as Dalawa. Nevertheless, his harsh measures produced results and peace and order were restored within a year of Velu Thampi's accession to the Dalawaship.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Intrigues==\nThe Dalawa's undue severity and overbearing conduct resulted in resentment amongst his colleagues, the very same people who had assisted his rise to power. A conspiracy was formed against him under the influence of Kunjunilam Pillai, a powerful Travancore cabinet official who succeeded in getting the Maharajah to sign a royal warrant to arrest and immediately execute Velu Thampi Dalawa. The Dalawa was at [[Allepey]] when he received news of the conspiracy and immediately hurried to [[Kochi|Cochin]] to meet the [[British Resident]], Major Macaulay, who had become a good friend. Macaulay had already received evidence that Kunjunilam Pillai had a major hand in the murder of Raja Kesavadas and hence he armed Velu Thampi with a small force of British soldiers and sent him to Trivandrum to investigate Kunjunilam Pillai's conspiracy. Pillai was found guilty of murder and conspiracy and punished accordingly. With this obstacle removed, Velu Thampi regained his former influence.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Mutiny of the Nair troops==\nThe armies of Travancore consisted mainly of members of the [[Nair]] group of castes. Velu Thampi's 1804 proposal to reduce their allowances was met with immediate discontent. The troops believed that the idea had come from the British and immediately resolved to assassinate both Major Macaulay and Velu Thampi. Velu Thampi fled once more to [[Kochi|Cochin]] to seek refuge with Macaulay. The Nairs marched to Trivandrum with a ten thousand strong army of sepoys and demanded that the Maharajah immediately dismiss the Dalawa and end any alliance with the British. Meanwhile, the Resident and the Dalawa collected forces at Cochin and, assisted by the Carnatic Brigade, marched to Trivandrum and put an end to the mutiny. Several of its leaders were executed in the most gruesome manner. One Krishna Pillai, a commander of a regiment, had his legs tied to two elephants which were driven in the opposite direction, tearing him to pieces.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Alliance with the British==\nThe Treaty signed with the British East India Company by the popular Maharajah [[Dharma Raja]] Rama Varma in 1795 was revised in what is known as the Treaty of 1805 (according to the English East India Company's policy of \"Subordinate Isolation\") after the insurrection of the Nair troops in Travancore. It increased the British Indian force stationed in Travancore and the amount of money to be paid as tribute to the British, though the expenditure of the State in maintaining its own standing army was drastically cut. This was the main change brought about in the Treaty of 1805.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Position==\nTravancore was at that time, owing to all its internal problems, facing a heavy financial crisis and the ratification of the Treaty by Velu Thampi created serious discontent as it increased the dependence of Travancore on the British and also made it indebted to the English Company. In spite of being fully aware of the financial crisis in Travancore, the Resident Major Macaulay pressed Velu Thampi for immediate payment of the large amount of tribute and the expenses of putting down the mutiny of the Nair troops. The Maharajah meanwhile wrote to the Madras government for the recall of the Resident and appointment of a new Resident which was denied. But this news made the Resident more obstinate against Travancore and he pressurised the Dalawa for payments immediately.\n\nThe Dalawa was now disillusioned with the British whom he had considered a friend and who considered any \"aggression on Travancore as an aggression on themselves\" as per the previous treaties. His discontent was first given vent to by the assassination of the ambassador of the Resident in the court. The Maharajah had communicated his discontent with the Dalawa to this ambassador, a certain Subba Iyen, and this information was known to the [[Maharajah]]s wife, Arumana Amma, a noblewomen of the Arumana Ammaveedu family. She was a lady of influence, who apparently communicated Royal secrets to the Dalawa, and she informed the Dalawa of the Maharajah's intention to dismiss him, with support from the Resident. This increased the anger of the Dalawa against the British. First the Resident demanded for impossible amounts of money and now he had started interfering with the internal affairs of the state.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Insurrection==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:\u0d2e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d23\u0d1f\u0d3f \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d47\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d02.jpg|thumb|The [[Mannadi]] Temple, where Thampi committed suicide]]\nVelu Thampi Dalawa and the Paliath Achan, Govindan [[Menon (subcaste)|Menon]], met and decided on the extirpation of the British Resident and end of British supremacy in their respective states.

This school was the predecessor of the KIM. During the time of the [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806), as the Dutch Navy began to become more organized, the training school was improved as well. With the forming of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] on 10 January 1816, an institute for training naval officers was founded in [[Delft]]. Twelve years later, it was moved to a site near [[Medemblik]], and many improvements were made for the move. A boarding school system was introduced, and the institute applied for officer training. On 28 August 1829, the opening of the institute was celebrated in the great church of Medemblik. That date is now observed as the anniversary of KIM's founding. In 1854, the current campus at [[Willemsoord, Den Helder|Willemsoord]] in [[Den Helder]] was opened. In 2005 the academy was incorporated in the newly founded 'Nederlandse Defensie Academy' (NLDA), which was followed by the arrival of a lot of army and air force cadets in technical studies, and the transfer of midshipmen that followed non-technical studies to Breda, effectively ending its role as a 'maritime' academy.\n\n==Alumni==\n*[[Piet de Jong]] '34, former [[Prime Minister of The Netherlands]] (1967\u20131971)\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Lacombl\u00e9]] '17, [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] recipient of the [[Military William Order]]\n*[[Hans Larive]], escapee from Colditz, recipient of the Military William Order\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Royal Netherlands Naval College}}\n*[http://www.kim.nl Official website in Dutch]\n\n{{NATO Military Academies}}\n{{Naval academies}}\n\n{{coord|52|57|44|N|4|46|30|E|region:NL_type:edu_source:kolossus-nlwiki|display=title}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct military academies]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1829]]\n[[Category:Military academies of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Naval academies]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in the Netherlands with royal patronage]]\n[[Category:Royal Netherlands Navy]]\n[[Category:Den Helder]]\n[[Category:1829 establishments in the Netherlands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox University \n|name           = Koninklijk Instituut voor de Marine <br/> Royal Naval College\n|image_name     = Den Helder - Fors gebouw anno 1869.JPG\n|image_size     = \n|motto          = Sumus et fore speramus\n|mottoeng       = We are and hope to become\n|established    = 28 August 1829\n|closed    = 2005\n|type           = National [[military academy]]\n|Carnegie Class = \n|head_label     = \n|head           = \n|city           ={{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Den Helder]]\n|state          = \n|country        =  [[The Netherlands]]\n|undergrad      = 150<ref>http://www.kim.nl/</ref>\n|postgrad       =  \n|staff          =  90<ref>http://www.kim.nl/</ref>\n|affiliations   = \n|campus         = [[Naval base]]\n|mascot         = \n|free_label     = \n|free           = \n|colors         = \n|website= [http://www.kim.nl/ www.kim.nl]\n|}}\n\nThe '''Royal Naval College''' was the [[service academy]] of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].

He made two more films with Olson: ''[[Force of Arms (film)|Force of Arms]]'' (1951) at Warners and ''[[Submarine Command (film)|Submarine Command]]'' (1951) at Paramount.

At Paramount, he was in a comedy with [[Ginger Rogers]] that was not particularly popular, ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953).

Well, not everybody! I didn't know.\"<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|174}} The interactions between Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden made shooting less than pleasant, as Bogart had wanted his wife, [[Lauren Bacall]], to play Sabrina. Bogart was not especially friendly toward Hepburn, who had little Hollywood experience, while Holden's reaction was the opposite, wrote biographer Michelangelo Capua.<ref>Capua 2010, p. 78</ref> Holden recalls their romance:{{quote|Before I even met her, I had a crush on her, and after I met her, just a day later, I felt as if we were old friends, and I was rather fiercely protective of her, though not in a possessive way.<ref>Capua 2010 p. 79</ref>}} Their relationship did not last much beyond the completion of the film. Holden, who was at this point dependent on alcohol, said, \"I really was in love with Audrey, but she wouldn't marry me.\"<ref>Capua 2010 p. 77</ref> Rumors at the time had it that Hepburn wanted a family, but when Holden told her that he had had a vasectomy and having children was impossible, she moved on. A few months later, Hepburn met [[Mel Ferrer]], whom she later married.<ref>Capua 2010 p. 82</ref>\n\nHe took third billing for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954) with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Grace Kelly]], directed by George Seaton from a play by [[Clifford Odets]].

April 17, 1918 \u2013 November 12, 1981) was an [[United States|American]] actor who was one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1950s. He won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for the film ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie]] for the television film ''[[The Blue Knight (film)|The Blue Knight]]'' (1973).

He was named one of the \"[[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top 10 Stars of the Year]]\" six times (1954\u20131958, 1961), and appeared as 25th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|25 greatest male stars]] of Classic Hollywood Cinema.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:William Holden-Cobb-Golden Boy.jpg|thumb|With [[Lee J.

She liked Holden and went out of her way to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them into lifelong friends. When she received her [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] at the [[54th Academy Awards|1982 Academy Award ceremony]], Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: \"I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar.

He followed it with a romantic comedy, ''[[Dear Ruth (film)|Dear Ruth]]'' (1947) and he was one of many cameos in ''[[Variety Girl (film)|Variety Girl]]'' (1947).<ref name=\"uni\">Richard B.

Holden earned his first Best Actor Oscar nomination with the part.<ref>Capua 2010, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nGetting the part was a lucky break for Holden, as the role was initially cast with [[Montgomery Clift]], who backed out of his contract.<ref name=Monush>Monush, Barry.

Every woman was in love with him.\"<ref name=Chandler>Chandler, Charlotte. ''Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder: a Personal Biography'', Simon & Schuster (2002) p. 147</ref> Paramount reunited him with [[Nancy Olson]], one of his ''Sunset Boulevard'' costars, in ''[[Union Station (film)|Union Station]]'' (1950).\n\nHolden had another good break when cast as [[Judy Holliday]]'s love interest in the big-screen adaptation of ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950). He made two more films with Olson: ''[[Force of Arms (film)|Force of Arms]]'' (1951) at Warners and ''[[Submarine Command (film)|Submarine Command]]'' (1951) at Paramount. Holden did a sports film at Columbia, ''[[Boots Malone]]'' (1952), then returned to Paramount for ''[[The Turning Point (1952 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1952).\n\n===''Stalag 17'' and peak of stardom===\nHolden was reunited with Wilder in ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), for which Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor. This ushered in the peak years of Holden's stardom.<ref name=obit /> He made a sex comedy with [[David Niven]] for [[Otto Preminger]], ''[[The Moon Is Blue (film)|The Moon Is Blue]]'' (1953), which was a huge hit, in part due to controversy over its content. At Paramount, he was in a comedy with [[Ginger Rogers]] that was not particularly popular, ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953). A Western at MGM, ''[[Escape from Fort Bravo]]'' (1953) did much better, and the all-star ''[[Executive Suite (film)|Executive Suite]]'' (1954) was a notable success.<ref>{{cite web |title=Forever Female (1954) \u2013 Overview |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75413/Forever-Female/ |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Sabrina''===\n[[File:Holden-Hepburn-Sabrina.jpg|thumb|With [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''Sabrina'' (1954)]]\nHolden made a third film with Wilder, ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), billed beneath [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=30 Days, 30 Classics \u2013 Day 17: Sabrina (1954) starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart|url=https://writerlovesmovies.com/2012/10/19/30-days-30-classics-day-17-sabrina-1954-starring-audrey-hepburn-william-holden-and-humphrey-bogart/|website=Writer Loves Movies|accessdate= January 3, 2017|date= October 19, 2012}}</ref> Holden and Hepburn became romantically involved during the filming, unbeknown to Wilder: \"People on the set told me later that Bill and Audrey were having an affair, and everybody knew. Well, not everybody! I didn't know.\"<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|174}} The interactions between Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden made shooting less than pleasant, as Bogart had wanted his wife, [[Lauren Bacall]], to play Sabrina. Bogart was not especially friendly toward Hepburn, who had little Hollywood experience, while Holden's reaction was the opposite, wrote biographer Michelangelo Capua.<ref>Capua 2010, p. 78</ref> Holden recalls their romance:{{quote|Before I even met her, I had a crush on her, and after I met her, just a day later, I felt as if we were old friends, and I was rather fiercely protective of her, though not in a possessive way.<ref>Capua 2010 p. 79</ref>}} Their relationship did not last much beyond the completion of the film. Holden, who was at this point dependent on alcohol, said, \"I really was in love with Audrey, but she wouldn't marry me.\"<ref>Capua 2010 p. 77</ref> Rumors at the time had it that Hepburn wanted a family, but when Holden told her that he had had a vasectomy and having children was impossible, she moved on. A few months later, Hepburn met [[Mel Ferrer]], whom she later married.<ref>Capua 2010 p. 82</ref>\n\nHe took third billing for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954) with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Grace Kelly]], directed by George Seaton from a play by [[Clifford Odets]].

When Luhut was three years old, the family moved to [[Riau]] province, where his father took a job with Caltex. They lived in [[Rumbai]] district, where Luhut attended Yayasan Cendana Elementary School, which was owned by Caltex. He later attended junior high school in [[Pekanbaru]]. Luhut became a keen swimmer, practicing in the [[Siak River]], and represented Riau at a national sports event in 1962. Despite his athletic success, his parents felt he misbehaved because he liked to fight, so they sent him to school in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saputra |first1=Azhar |title=Masa Kecil Luhut di Pekanbaru Suka Betumbuk dan Berenang di Sungai Siak |url=https://www.riauonline.co.id/riau/kota-pekanbaru/read/2019/01/17/masa-kecil-luhut-di-pekanbaru-suka-betumbuk-dan-berenang-di-sungai-siak |accessdate=17 January 2020 |publisher=RiauOnline |date=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nLuhut attended Penabur Senior High School in Bandung.

He said the rioters, who were no longer student protesters, began throwing stones at his troops. Luhut responded by ordering his men to fire warning shots, but he said this had no effect on the rioters. He then ordered his men to shoot at the legs of the rioters, and he suspected several were killed in the ensuing chaos as troops were not equipped with rubber bullets. His men chased the rioters to Jalan Juanda, to Glodok and even to the [[Kramat Tunggak]] brothel complex in North Jakarta, where Luhut arrested human rights activist [[Poncke Princen|Johannes Cornelis Princen]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tentara Bingung Demonstran Tak Terbendung |url=https://majalah.tempo.co/read/144459/tentara-bingung-demonstran-tak-terbendung?hidden=login |accessdate=16 January 2020 |publisher=Tempo.co |date=13 January 2014}}</ref> \n\nLuhut served four times in [[East Timor]], first as a 28-year-old in the December 1975 [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian invasion]] force.

Their mission was to increase the participation of women in the democratic processes of voting and drafting the constitution. In collaboration with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ([[UNTAC]]), and with CWCNVE launched advocacy and media campaigns and produced radio programs about voting. They collaborated with the NGO MediaTies to train a group of women in video production skills in order to document the election from a non-partisan perspective.\n\nThe momentum continued during the drafting of the Constitution of Cambodia. Through workshops, they gathered ideas from rural women and presented them to the Constituent Assembly. One outcome of those workshops was the production of a seven-minute video. It was called 'The Rights of Women To Be Guaranteed' and was broadcast nationally as the Constitution was being drafted.</p align>\n\nSome of the coalition members recognized the need to continue to promote the rights of women even after the elections and UNTAC. They recognized the power of the media in promoting and protecting these rights as well as raising pressing development issues in the country.

Their mission was to increase the participation of women in the democratic processes of voting and drafting the constitution. In collaboration with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ([[UNTAC]]), and with CWCNVE launched advocacy and media campaigns and produced radio programs about voting. They collaborated with the NGO MediaTies to train a group of women in video production skills in order to document the election from a non-partisan perspective.\n\nThe momentum continued during the drafting of the Constitution of Cambodia. Through workshops, they gathered ideas from rural women and presented them to the Constituent Assembly. One outcome of those workshops was the production of a seven-minute video. It was called 'The Rights of Women To Be Guaranteed' and was broadcast nationally as the Constitution was being drafted.</p align>\n\nSome of the coalition members recognized the need to continue to promote the rights of women even after the elections and UNTAC. They recognized the power of the media in promoting and protecting these rights as well as raising pressing development issues in the country. This core group of women went on to become the founders of the Women's Media Centre of Cambodia, and officially established it as a non-profit, non-governmental organization in January 1995.\n\nSince 1995 \u2018Women's Media Centre of Cambodia\u2019 (WMC) continues acknowledging the power of media in promoting social change in Cambodian society.
