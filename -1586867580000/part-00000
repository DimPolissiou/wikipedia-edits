The line-up of the band has included [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] and vocalist [[Maxim (musician)|Maxim]], dancer and vocalist [[Keith Flint]] (until his death in March 2019), dancer and live keyboardist [[Leeroy Thornhill]] (who left to pursue a solo career in 1999), and dancer and vocalist Sharky (1990-1991). Along with [[the Chemical Brothers]] and [[Fatboy Slim]], The Prodigy are credited as pioneers of the [[breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]-influenced genre [[big beat]], which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock-inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic rave music beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's omnipresent mystique, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style and Flint's modern punk appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/big-beat-d4546 |title=Big Beat |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Prodigy first emerged in the underground rave scene in the early 1990s and achieved popularity and worldwide recognition with [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1990s|UK number one singles]] such as \"[[Firestarter (Prodigy song)|Firestarter]]\" and \"[[Breathe (Prodigy song)|Breathe]]\", both singles coming from their UK and US chart topping album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]'' (1997).

These were committed mainly by the [[Moroccan Goumier]]s, [[colonial troops]] of the [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943-1944)|French Expeditionary Corps]] (FEC),<ref>{{lang-fr|Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais}}'' (CEF) or ''{{lang|fr| Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais en Italie}}'' (CEFI)</ref> commanded by General [[Alphonse Juin]], and mostly targeted civilian women and girls (as well as a few men and boys) in the rural area between Naples and Rome, traditionally known in Italian as ''[[Ciociaria]]''.\n\nThe monument \"Mamma Ciociara\" was erected in remembrance of the Marocchinate women, particularly those who were killed during the military campaign.\n\n==Background==\n''[[Goumiers]]'' were [[colonial troops|colonial irregular troops]] forming the ''Goums Marocains'', which were approximately company-sized units rather loosely grouped in ''Tabors'' ([[battalion]]s) and ''Groupes'' ([[regiment]]s). Three of the units, the 1st, 3rd and 4th ''Groupements de Tabors'', served in the FEC along with the four regular [[Division (military)|division]]s: the [[1st Free French Division]], the [[2nd Moroccan Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Algerian Infantry Division]] and the [[4th Moroccan Mountain Division]]. The ''Goums Marocains'' were commanded by General [[Augustin Guillaume]].\n\nRegular Moroccan troops (''[[tirailleurs]] marocains'') also served in Italy but under tighter discipline and with a higher proportion of officers than the irregular goumiers.\n\nOn May 14, 1944, the Goumiers travelled over seemingly impassable terrain in the [[Aurunci Mountains]], outflanked the German defence in the adjacent Liri valley, materially assisting the [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], to break the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and advance to the next [[Wehrmacht]] prepared defensive position, the [[Hitler Line]].\n\nFor the population, such a generalized level of violence could not have taken place without the approval of the Anglo-American commands, accused of having left the colonial soldiers' hands free <ref>{{cite web|author=Baris, Tommaso|url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_REVUE=VING&ID_NUMPUBLIE=VIN_093&ID_ARTICLE=VING_093_0047|title=Le corps exp\u00e9ditionnaire fran\u00e7ais en Italie \u2013 Violences des \" lib\u00e9rateurs \" durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1944|trans-title=The French Expeditionary Corps in Italy \u2013 Violence of the \"liberators\" during the summer of 1944|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nA statement by General [[Alphonse Juin]] before the battle allegedly said: \"For fifty hours you will be the absolute masters of what you will find beyond the enemy.

This false statement explains the concrete experience of the population. From the point of view of the inhabitants of southern Lazio, it was impossible that in the framework of an army, soldiers could, without the agreement of the higher hierarchies, arrive at such extremes and such violence.

Italian victims' associations such as ''Associazione Nazionale Vittime delle Marocchinate'' alleged that 60,000 women, ranging in age from 11 to 86, suffered from violence, when village after village came under control of the Goumiers.

for \"Moroccan\u2019 deeds\") is a term applied to the mass [[rape]] and killings committed during [[World War II]] after the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in [[Italy]]. These were committed mainly by the [[Moroccan Goumier]]s, [[colonial troops]] of the [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943-1944)|French Expeditionary Corps]] (FEC),<ref>{{lang-fr|Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais}}'' (CEF) or ''{{lang|fr| Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais en Italie}}'' (CEFI)</ref> commanded by General [[Alphonse Juin]], and mostly targeted civilian women and girls (as well as a few men and boys) in the rural area between Naples and Rome, traditionally known in Italian as ''[[Ciociaria]]''.\n\nThe monument \"Mamma Ciociara\" was erected in remembrance of the Marocchinate women, particularly those who were killed during the military campaign.\n\n==Background==\n''[[Goumiers]]'' were [[colonial troops|colonial irregular troops]] forming the ''Goums Marocains'', which were approximately company-sized units rather loosely grouped in ''Tabors'' ([[battalion]]s) and ''Groupes'' ([[regiment]]s). Three of the units, the 1st, 3rd and 4th ''Groupements de Tabors'', served in the FEC along with the four regular [[Division (military)|division]]s: the [[1st Free French Division]], the [[2nd Moroccan Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Algerian Infantry Division]] and the [[4th Moroccan Mountain Division]]. The ''Goums Marocains'' were commanded by General [[Augustin Guillaume]].\n\nRegular Moroccan troops (''[[tirailleurs]] marocains'') also served in Italy but under tighter discipline and with a higher proportion of officers than the irregular goumiers.\n\nOn May 14, 1944, the Goumiers travelled over seemingly impassable terrain in the [[Aurunci Mountains]], outflanked the German defence in the adjacent Liri valley, materially assisting the [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], to break the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and advance to the next [[Wehrmacht]] prepared defensive position, the [[Hitler Line]].\n\nA statement by General [[Alphonse Juin]] before the battle allegedly said: \"For fifty hours you will be the absolute masters of what you will find beyond the enemy.
