The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.<ref>Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624\u2013625.</ref>\n\nIn addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Holy Roman Empire}}\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* [[Carolingian Empire]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs]]\n* [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*[[Eamon Duffy|Duffy, Eamon]]. 1997.

The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2Zsef |date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.\n\nAlbert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.\n\nInstead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.<ref name=\"Rothstein1995\">{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\nIn the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War|a war]] with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>Istvan Szepesi, \"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\" ''Waterloo Historical Review'' 7 (2015).

This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite journal|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Deutschland im XVI.

This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\").\nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\nThroughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220\u20131254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806.<ref name=\"BibliothekEhlers2016\">{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd P\u00e4ffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen K\u00f6nigspfalzen.

Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follows:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;\n* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;\n* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;\n* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:<ref>Whaley, vol.

The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.\n\nFollowing the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a \"normal year\". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion.

Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings.

Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable.

The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights.

Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />\n\nManley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nViolence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect.

Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.\n\nIn the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.\n\n==Opposition==\nAs [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election \u2013 two years early \u2013 on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nManley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDuring his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Re-election==\nBy 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour \u2013 both with the electorate and the US \u2013 and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nManley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nThe government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt.

At about the same time, he became involved in the [[trade union]] movement, becoming a [[negotiation|negotiator]] for the [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]].

However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the [[Parliament of Jamaica]]. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Manley|title=Michael Manley - prime minister of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter his father's retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the [[People's National Party]], defeating [[Vivian Blake (politician)|Vivian Blake]].<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tmxS6La_EC&pg=PA98|first=Anita M.|last=Waters|title=Race, Class, and Political Symbols: Rastafari and Reggae in Jamaican Politics|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1985|page=98|access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> He then served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|leader of the Opposition]], until his party won in the general elections of 1972.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n\n==Domestic reforms==\nIn the election of 1972, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, [[Hugh Shearer]], as his People's National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the [[Kariba suit]], a type of formal bush jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nUnder Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Michael-Manley---the-visionary-who-will-never-be|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas.<ref>Ewart Walters, ''We Come From Jamaica''  (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), p. 198</ref> The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.<ref>Walters, p. 198</ref> An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration or purchased by large [[bauxite]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Insight Guide: Jamaica'', Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSubsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chuck Stewart, ''The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide'', Volume 1.</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming Development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A.

Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />\n\nManley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nViolence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Can-we-really-entrust-the-JCF-with-the-anti-gang-legislation-_16149216|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nViolence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.\n\nIn the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.\n\n==Opposition==\nAs [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election \u2013 two years early \u2013 on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nManley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDuring his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Re-election==\nBy 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour \u2013 both with the electorate and the US \u2013 and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nManley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nThe government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt.

Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away.

The church is dedicated to [[Our Lady of Help]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help was built in the 18th century. It replaced a simple [[wattle and daub]] chapel and school built by the [[Jesuits]] in early 1700s; they arrived in present-day Jaguaripe from Salvador via [[Ilha dos Frades]]. It was renovated in the 19th century in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, typical of church renovations in Bahia in the same century.<ref name=\"bahia\" /><ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is located at the highest point of the historic center of Jaguaripe. A winding, paved street connects Largo da Matriz, the church yard, to the town hall below. The church has broad views of the small historic center of Jaguaripe, the [[Jaguaripe River]], and rolling hills of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is constructed of lime and stone masonry and covers {{convert|1480|m2|ft2}}. The division of the plan of the church into three sections (a nave and two side corridors) is emphasized on the fa\u00e7ade by [[pilaster]]s. The church has gable roofs, one on the central body and one over the sacristies. The fa\u00e7ade has three portals with five windows at the choir level. Each of the windows has an arched lintel.<ref name=\"hpip\" />\n\nThe church has a single bell tower with a bulbous dome. The church has a monumental, rococo-style pediment with volutes, a stylized oculus at center, and tracings in terra-cotta painted yellow. The church has three bronze bells with heavy wooden bell yolks painted green.\n\nThe church opens to a broad church yard, now known as the Largo da Matriz. It has a concrete platform with small stair constructed in the 20th century. Two large yards are located to the sides of the church, a feature not found in other churches of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe interior of the church consists of a nave and side corridors surmounted by tribunes, a plan typical of Bahian churches of the 18th century. The church has two side chapels at the front of the church, one dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament. The church, somewhat unusually, has two sacristies, one on side of the chancel. The sacristies are accessed via the chancel and side chapels. The high altars and side altars are in the neoclassical style with [[talha dourado]], or gilded wood carvings; they replace the baroque altars of the original structures. The church interior once had numerous baroque-style paintings; they were removed during renovations of the church in the 18th century. The church has numerous examples of wood carving, including those located in the chancel, tribune handrails, a screen of the side chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament, the chancel, and the tribune handrail.\n\n===Sacristies===\n\nThe sacristies of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Help retain their 18th-century appearance. They have carved rococo alterpieces, a sacristy cabinet, and built-in closets. One altar is in the style typical during the reign of [[John V of Portugal]]. Its design is based on an altar originally in the [[Monastery of St. Benedict]] in Salvador and now located in the [[Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate]].

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.
