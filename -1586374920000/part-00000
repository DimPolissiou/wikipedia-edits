Tripp claimed that her motives were purely patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge in exchange for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from [[the Pentagon]] at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, while the administration claimed it to be a standard routine.

Meade|Fort Meade]] before being transferred to [[the Pentagon]] in 1987.\n\n==Government employment==\nTripp was a [[White House]] employee in the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration, and kept her job when [[Bill Clinton]] took over in 1993. During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp out, so they arranged a job for her in the public affairs office in the Pentagon which gave her a raise of $20,000 per year.<ref>Goldstein, Amy; and Sanchez, Rene.

Accessed October 9, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Involvement in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal==\nTripp became a close confidante of another former White House employee, [[Monica Lewinsky]], while they both worked in the Pentagon's public affairs office. According to Tripp, who is about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]], began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.\n\nIn August 1997, [[Michael Isikoff]], from ''[[Newsweek]]'', reported that Tripp said that she had encountered [[Kathleen Willey]] coming out of the Oval Office \"disheveled,\" with \"her face red and her lipstick was off.\" Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton's lawyer [[Robert S. Bennett]] said in the ''Newsweek'' article, \"Linda Tripp is not to be believed.\"<ref>[[Michael Isikoff|Isikoff, Michael]] and Thomas, Evan.

Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false [[affidavit]] denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in Arkansas in the ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to [[Subornation of perjury|suborn]] Tripp's [[perjury]] in the ''Clinton v. Jones'' suit to conceal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship as well as Tripp's claim regarding Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.<ref name=LarryKing>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/16/tripp.transcript/ Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live'], ''[[CNN]]'', February 16, 1999.

When the priest starts talking, one of the flowers falls and Maximus sniffs it and he sneezes causing the rings to be launched outside of the castle. While in shock, the priest asks them for the rings, only to find them gone. The Queen complains that it was her grandmother's wedding rings and one of the guards says that the kingdom is lost. This causes a lot of chaos around the kingdom and explosions start to happen, but it was revealed to be a dream. With more time, they go after the rings only to be launched in two directions.\n\nOne of them lands in a pot of soup and Pascal goes after it. When coming out, he causes chaos around the tables and finally retrieves the ring, only to find his tongue stuck in ice. Meanwhile, Maximus runs after the other ring, but he runs into shoes, make-up, hats and dresses and he is now dressed as a lady (a male horse falls in love with him, but he kicks him and goes after the ring). Pascal finally gets his tongue off the ice, but he lands on a waiter's foot, causing him to drop the lintels on the ice and it launches into the air. Maximus manages to retrieve the other ring, but the ice sculpture lands on a catapult he is sitting on and is launched into the air (he passes the windows where the ceremony is). He lands in a carriage and goes after the ring.\n\nMeanwhile, Pascal goes after the ring and it lands on a girl's lantern. He chases after it, only for him to be shocked when he finds out it is in hundreds of lanterns. Maximus manages to retrieve the ring, but his face gets knocked by several frying pans before hitting a giant frying pan. This causes a few residents to think it was the tong and they release the doves and the lanterns. Pascal finally finds the ring, but realizes he is very high. Meanwhile, the carriage Maximus is in finally stops and is launched into the air (passing Pascal, but he doesn't know that and looks at the camera). He lands on a decoration and a flock of doves passes Pascal, causing him to lose the ring. It hits a wind vane, a fountain, a decoration and a hook and finally lands on a dove's foot.\n\nMaximus hits the ground, but the hook that the ring landed on causes barrels of juice to chase Maximum and Pascal. When coming to a dead end, Maximus uses one of the decorations as a slingshot and launches them into the air for Pascal to grab the ring. Unfortunately, he misses, but he uses his tongue to grab it. Now with both rings secured, they land in a tar factory. Just as the priest finishes, he asks for the ring, only to find Pascal and Maximus covered in tar and they hand them the rings. The priest declares them husband and wife and they kiss. Just as everybody cheers, Maximus accidentally causes the cake trolley to roll out of the castle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Disney's Tangled characters}}\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as [[Rapunzel (Disney)|Princess Rapunzel]]\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as [[Flynn Rider|Eugene Fitzherbert]]\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Priest\n* [[Paul F.

The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737-300 wearing the airline's former livery, taking off at Leeds Bradford Airport in 2008]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]]  and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe airline acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]]. In November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\".

Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737-300 wearing the airline's former livery, taking off at Leeds Bradford Airport in 2008]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]]  and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> In 2007, sister company Jet2holidays was launched offering customers and travel agents [[Air Travel Organisers' Licensing|ATOL]] and [[ABTA \u2013 The Travel Association|ABTA]] protected [[Package tour|package holidays]].\n\nThe airline acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].

In the Trust's early years, prior to the incorporation of the charity, properties were often bought with the support of the Manifold Trust.  The Trust's current portfolio also includes properties bequeathed to the Trust, leased, or operated through a management agreement on behalf of other owners.  Dates of acquisition and first lettings are shown where available from Landmark Trust or other published sources; time differences between dates often reflect previous/current ownership and the extent of restoration required.\n\nDetailed histories of each building are prepared by the Trust's Historian during its renovation.  These include summaries plus before and after photographs of restoration works as carried out.  Each building history is then left as an album in the property for visitors to peruse.

In the Trust's early years, prior to the incorporation of the charity, properties were often bought with the support of the Manifold Trust.  The Trust's current portfolio also includes properties bequeathed to the Trust, leased, or operated through a management agreement on behalf of other owners.  Dates of acquisition and first lettings are shown where available from Landmark Trust or other published sources; time differences between dates often reflect previous/current ownership and the extent of restoration required.\n\nDetailed histories of each building are prepared by the Trust's Historian during its renovation.  These include summaries plus before and after photographs of restoration works as carried out.  Each building history is then left as an album in the property for visitors to peruse.  All Trust [https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/about-us/history-albums/ property history albums] were made available online for the first time in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/news-and-events/latest-news/history-albums-online-for-the-first-time/|title=The history of Landmark Trust buildings {{!}} The Landmark Trust|website=www.landmarktrust.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Channel Islands===\n[[File:Alderney - Fort Clonque 02.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Clonque, Alderney]]\n*[[Fort Clonque]], Alderney\n*[[Nicolle Tower]], [[Saint Clement, Jersey|St Clement]], Jersey\n\n===England===\n====Lundy====\n\nThe Landmark Trust manages the Island of [[Lundy]] in the [[Bristol Channel]] on behalf of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and operates a number of holiday cottages there.

Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the \"lady\", the \"flirt\", and the \"tomboy\".\nThe \"ladies\" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the \"ladies\" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\">{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe \"flirts\" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments.

They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a \"thick skin\". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/>\n\nThe findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/> For example, after an anti-groping device allowing victims to mark their assailants with an invisible ink stamp has been released in Japan, some experts claimed it is wrong to put the onus on the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|title=Anti-groping stamp lets victims mark assailants|last=|first=|date=29 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902031332/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|archive-date=2 September 2019|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Common effects on the victims===\n{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}\n\nCommon psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:\n* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people \"evaluate\" the victim to establish if he or she is \"worth\" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)\n* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip\n* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions;

However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The section below \"EEOC Definition\" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919234743/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |archive-date=September 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====EEOC Definition====\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name=\"eeoc\"/> In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,\n# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or\n# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\n1. and 2. are called \"[[quid pro quo]]\" (Latin for \"this for that\" or \"something for something\"). They are essentially \"sexual bribery\", or promising of benefits, and \"sexual coercion\".\n\nType 3. known as \"[[hostile work environment]]\", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name=\"webcom\" />\n\n'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a \"right to sue\" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====\n[[File:Stop \u00e0 la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]\n\nQuid pro quo means \"this for that\". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|archive-date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=|website=Sexual Harassment Support|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402083730/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|archivedate=2 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====\n{{Main|Hostile work environment}}\n\nThis occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both \"serious\" and \"frequent.\" Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802171805/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|archive-date=August 2, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThe line between \"[[quid pro quo]]\" and \"hostile environment\" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|title=Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=19 March 1990|website=|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910004803/https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|archive-date=10 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Hostile environment\" harassment may acquire characteristics of \"quid pro quo\" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred.\"</blockquote>\n\n=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814110642/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those \"with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender\", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.\n\n=====Retaliation=====\nRetaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment\u2014any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \"reasonable worker\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php|title=Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.\n\n=====New Jersey=====\nNew Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct. The Company would not be liable if they investigate the matter and take some remedial measures to make sure that the harassment stops. The Company only becomes liable if the activity occurs again.

Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the \"lady\", the \"flirt\", and the \"tomboy\".\nThe \"ladies\" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the \"ladies\" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\">{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe \"flirts\" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments.

They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a \"thick skin\". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/>\n\nThe findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.<ref name=\"Landrine 1997\"/> For example, after an anti-groping device allowing victims to mark their assailants with an invisible ink stamp has been released in Japan, some experts claimed it is wrong to put the onus on the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|title=Anti-groping stamp lets victims mark assailants|last=|first=|date=29 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902031332/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|archive-date=2 September 2019|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Common effects on the victims===\n{{Expert needed|Psychology|section|date=July 2018}}\n\nCommon psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:\n* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people \"evaluate\" the victim to establish if he or she is \"worth\" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)\n* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip\n* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions;

However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The section below \"EEOC Definition\" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919234743/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |archive-date=September 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====EEOC Definition====\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name=\"eeoc\"/> In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,\n# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or\n# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\n\n1. and 2. are called \"[[quid pro quo]]\" (Latin for \"this for that\" or \"something for something\"). They are essentially \"sexual bribery\", or promising of benefits, and \"sexual coercion\".\n\nType 3. known as \"[[hostile work environment]]\", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name=\"webcom\" />\n\n'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a \"right to sue\" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====\n[[File:Stop \u00e0 la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]\n\nQuid pro quo means \"this for that\". In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|archive-date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=|website=Sexual Harassment Support|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402083730/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|archivedate=2 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====\n{{Main|Hostile work environment}}\n\nThis occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both \"serious\" and \"frequent.\" Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment?|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2013|website=|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802171805/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|archive-date=August 2, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThe line between \"[[quid pro quo]]\" and \"hostile environment\" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|title=Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=19 March 1990|website=|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910004803/https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|archive-date=10 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Hostile environment\" harassment may acquire characteristics of \"quid pro quo\" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred.\"</blockquote>\n\n=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814110642/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those \"with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender\", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.\n\n=====Retaliation=====\nRetaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment\u2014any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \"reasonable worker\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php|title=Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.\n\n=====New Jersey=====\nNew Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct. The Company would not be liable if they investigate the matter and take some remedial measures to make sure that the harassment stops. The Company only becomes liable if the activity occurs again.

It is among a cluster of stations in the market owned by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]].  Its transmitter is located blocks from the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]], and studios are located at the [[50 Penn Place]] building on the Northwest side.\n\n==KGCB/KOCY==\n1340 started as KGCB, a church-owned station. It was purchased in the late 1930s by Matthew Bonebrake - a former OPUBCO and WKY radio sales manager - who changed the call letters to KOCY.\n\nIt was a Mutual affiliate during the 1940s and early 1950s. It became Oklahoma City's first full-time Top-40 station in the mid-1950s. It was also the first radio station in the country to offer \"News Every Hour - On the Hour\".\n\nAfter [[WKY]] and KOMA went Top-40, KOCY had a \"funeral\" for their format, by giving away records in a coffin before switching to a MOR format.\n\n==Changes over the airwaves==\nIn the mid-1990s KGHM aired an [[Urban Contemporary]] format in the evenings and overnights as \"The Groove 1340\".\n\nIn 2000, [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] went into an agreement with [[Perry Publishing and Broadcasting|Perry Broadcasting]] to broadcast KVSP/1140 and its Urban format (See [[KRMP]]) on KEBC from 7 pm\u22127 am as \"The Power Jammin' Network after AM 1140 signed off at sunset. Between 7am-7pm KGHM aired Spanish programming.\n\nThe agreement between Clear Channel and Perry Broadcasting discontinued when Perry purchased KRPT/103.5 out of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]] (See [[KVSP]]) and upgraded the station to target Oklahoma City, then moved KVSP's Urban format to the FM dial. The Spanish format was also dropped as well for Talk format.\n\n==\"Keeping Everybody Country\"==\nKEBC's call letters were previously used for 94.7 KEBC, later a property also owned by Clear Channel. The station's slogan, \"Keeping Everybody Country.\"  Ironically, KEBC's competitor at the time, [[KXXY-FM]], simulcasted their FM signal at 1340 AM.\n\nThe call letters KEBC stood for Electronic Broadcasting Company which was the original ownership of 94.7 KEBC. (Ronnie Tutor- Engineering and Gene Wingate- GM among others)  KEBC originally studioed and transmitted from \"Rambling Ranchstyle studios\" in SE OKC before moving to 31st and Western to studio space owned by Ralph Tyler.\n\nMounting debt to Tyler for rent and other financial obligation created a situation where Tyler became controlling owner of KEBC radio.  After Ralph Tyler's controlling ownership of KEBC, the slogan Keep Everybody Country was formed on a suggestion from a friend of Ralph's.\n\n==Programming==\nKGHM had simulcast some programming of sister station [[KTOK]] along with their own line-up since 2005. In January, 2007, Clear Channel flipped the station to Fox Sports Radio 1340 then later 1340 the game, making it the fourth all-sports station in Oklahoma City. Former Dallas Cowboys play-by-play broadcaster David Garrett was KGHM's sports director, Garrett had worked as sports director for sister station KTOK-AM in the late 1980s before moving on to the NFL. Garrett also hosted an afternoon sports talk show on KGHM from January 2007 to early 2008 and returned to hosting in late spring/early summer of 2008. Garrett was also did play-by-play for some on the Oklahoma City High School Football games that aired on KGHM as well. In early 2013 Garrett was relieved of his duties as Sports director and show host as station owner Clear Channel Radio (Oklahoma City.) was going through some personnel changes at that time. As of Spring 2013-present, KGHM-AM & [[KTOK-AM]]'s current sports director is Randy Renner, a former reporter for Oklahoma City CBS affiliate [[KWTV-TV]].\n\nIn mid March 2003, it was announced that then KEBC-AM would carry the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992\u20132009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] hockey games for the remainder of the 2002-2003 [[Central Hockey League]] season and playoffs following the sale of KEBC-AM & KTOK-AM's then sister station [[WKY-AM]] (Owned by [[Oklahoma Publishing Co]], operated under Clear Channel via a Lease Management Agreement.) to main radio rival [[Citadel Communication corporation]]. KEBC-AM also aired the Blazers radio talk show \"Strictly Hockey Blazers Style\", a weekly show that aired live every Monday night through out the Blazers season from 7:00 PM CST to 8:00 PM CST from the location of an Oklahoma City Restaurant, featured interviews with players, coach's, trainers, team staff etc. KEBC-AM would air the Blazers again for the 2003-2004 season with the Blazers unable to find another station to air their games. The Blazers would return to 1340-AM (Along with the [[Oklahoma City RedHawks]] baseball team having already returned in the spring 2006.) for the 2006-2007 season following a two year stint on [[WKY-AM]] (Now under the ownership of Citadel.) after that station flipped from News/Talk to Spanish. The Blazers would remain on 1340-AM for the remainder of the teams existence until they folded in the Summer of 2009 after 17 seasons. KGHM-AM would also air selected games of the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] (The successor to the Blazers.) Hockey games from 2010-2011 thru the 2014-2015 seasons (When the team folded in the Spring of 2015 after 5 seasons.) whenever there were scheduling or programming conflicts with sister station and primary radio home of the Barons [[KXXY-AM]] (Which also carried Oklahoma State Cowboy football and Men's Basketball games). NOTE: then KOCY-AM was also the station that carried the games of the original Oklahoma City Blazers Hockey Franchise (In the original [[Central Hockey League]].) from around the late 1960s and throughout the mid to late 1970s.                        \n\nKGHM's other programming line up also includes, in addition to national sports, programming from Fox Sports Radio. Local sports talk shows are simulcasted with [[KREF|KREF-AM]] 1400 (Another Fox Sports Radio affiliate) in [[Norman Oklahoma]] with KREF-KGHM on air personalities, coverage and broadcasts of local and national sports, local high school and collage Sports. For several years KGHM also carried [[University of Central Oklahoma]] Broncos Football and Men's & Women's Basketball games. KGHM also airs select Oklahoma State Cowboy games (With sister station [[KXXY-FM]].) along with coverage and broadcasting of National Collage Football and Basketball games, selected local Oklahoma high school football games on Friday and Saturday nights, and selected Oklahoma high school basketball games throughout the season alongside sister station [[KTOK]]-AM. Friday Night Finals, a weekly two hour show of state wide High School Football scores and highlights (can also be heard via simulcast with sister station KTOK-AM) from 10:00 to midnight on Friday nights (that runs from first Friday of September til the second or third Friday of November). Game Day Saturday, a look at Collage football games, specifically University of Oklahoma & Oklahoma state football (also simulcast with sister station KTOK-AM). Since 2003, and again from 2006-present, KGHM has carried the games of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] (Formally the Oklahoma RedHawks AKA Oklahoma city RedHawks.) Minor League [[Triple-A baseball]] team, the [[Pacific Coast League]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]). Starting with the 2015 [[Major League Baseball]] season, the station began carrying select [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games as part of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] radio network, alongside sister station [[KTOK]]-AM, on days when the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] are not playing or at the conclusion of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] [[Triple-A baseball]], [[Pacific Coast League]] season, the remaining parent club [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games move to KGHM for the rest of the [[Major League Baseball]] regular season and playoffs. In late 2018 both KTOK-AM and KGHM-AM's station affiliations with the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network were not renewed for the 2019 Major League Baseball season ending sixteen years of Professional Baseball airing on both stations.\n\n==External links==\n*https://1340thegame.iheart.com\n{{AM station data|KGHM}}\n\n{{Oklahoma City Radio}}\n{{Sports Radio Stations in Oklahoma}}\n{{IHeartMedia}}\n\n{{coord|35|29|28|N|97|30|33|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Oklahoma City|GHM]]\n[[Category:Sports radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Midwest City, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1933]]\n[[Category:IHeartMedia radio stations]]\n[[Category:1933 establishments in Oklahoma]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sports radio station in Oklahoma City}}\n{{unref|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n | name = KGHM\n | image = File:KGHM 1340TheGame logo.png\n | city = [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]]\n | area = [[Oklahoma City Metroplex]]\n | branding = 1340 The Game\n | slogan = Most Local Games in Oklahoma City\n | frequency = 1340 [[kHz]]\n | format = [[Sports radio|Sports]]\n | power = 1,000 [[watt]]s (Daytime)<br>1,000 [[watt]]s (Nighttime)\n | class = C\n | facility_id = 58388\n | owner = [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]  \n | licensee = Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc.\n | webcast = [http://www.1340thegame.com/mediaplayer/ Listen Live]\n | website = {{URL|1340thegame.com}}\n}}\n\n'''KGHM''' (1340 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[radio station]] located in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

The Spanish format was also dropped as well for Talk format.\n\n==\"Keeping Everybody Country\"==\nKEBC's call letters were previously used for 94.7 KEBC, later a property also owned by Clear Channel. The station's slogan, \"Keeping Everybody Country.\"  Ironically, KEBC's competitor at the time, [[KXXY-FM]], simulcasted their FM signal at 1340 AM.\n\nThe call letters KEBC stood for Electronic Broadcasting Company which was the original ownership of 94.7 KEBC. (Ronnie Tutor- Engineering and Gene Wingate- GM among others)  KEBC originally studioed and transmitted from \"Rambling Ranchstyle studios\" in SE OKC before moving to 31st and Western to studio space owned by Ralph Tyler.\n\nMounting debt to Tyler for rent and other financial obligation created a situation where Tyler became controlling owner of KEBC radio.  After Ralph Tyler's controlling ownership of KEBC, the slogan Keep Everybody Country was formed on a suggestion from a friend of Ralph's.\n\n==Programming==\nKGHM had simulcast some programming of sister station [[KTOK]] along with their own line-up since 2005. In January, 2007, Clear Channel flipped the station to Fox Sports Radio 1340 then later 1340 the game, making it the fourth all-sports station in Oklahoma City. Former Dallas Cowboys play-by-play broadcaster David Garrett was KGHM's sports director, Garrett had worked as sports director for sister station KTOK-AM in the late 1980s before moving on to the NFL. Garrett also hosted an afternoon sports talk show on KGHM from January 2007 to early 2008 and returned to hosting in late spring/early summer of 2008. Garrett was also did play-by-play for some on the Oklahoma City High School Football games that aired on KGHM as well. In early 2013 Garrett was relieved of his duties as Sports director and show host as station owner Clear Channel Radio (Oklahoma City.) was going through some personnel changes at that time. As of Spring 2013-present, KGHM-AM & [[KTOK-AM]]'s current sports director is Randy Renner, a former reporter for Oklahoma City CBS affiliate [[KWTV-TV]].\n\nIn mid March 2003, it was announced that then KEBC-AM would carry the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992\u20132009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] hockey games for the remainder of the 2002-2003 [[Central Hockey League]] season and playoffs following the sale of KEBC-AM & KTOK-AM's then sister station [[WKY-AM]] (Owned by [[Oklahoma Publishing Co]], operated under Clear Channel via a Lease Management Agreement.) to main radio rival [[Citadel Communication corporation]]. KEBC-AM also aired the Blazers radio talk show \"Strictly Hockey Blazers Style\", a weekly show that aired live every Monday night through out the Blazers season from 7:00 PM CST to 8:00 PM CST from the location of an Oklahoma City Restaurant, featured interviews with players, coach's, trainers, team staff etc. KEBC-AM would air the Blazers again for the 2003-2004 season with the Blazers unable to find another station to air their games. The Blazers would return to 1340-AM (Along with the [[Oklahoma City RedHawks]] baseball team having already returned in the spring 2006.) for the 2006-2007 season following a two year stint on [[WKY-AM]] (Now under the ownership of Citadel.) after that station flipped from News/Talk to Spanish. The Blazers would remain on 1340-AM for the remainder of the teams existence until they folded in the Summer of 2009 after 17 seasons. KGHM-AM would also air selected games of the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] (The successor to the Blazers.) Hockey games from 2010-2011 thru the 2014-2015 seasons (When the team folded in the Spring of 2015 after 5 seasons.) whenever there were scheduling or programming conflicts with sister station and primary radio home of the Barons [[KXXY-AM]] (Which also carried Oklahoma State Cowboy football and Men's Basketball games). NOTE: then KOCY-AM was also the station that carried the games of the original Oklahoma City Blazers Hockey Franchise (In the original [[Central Hockey League]].) from around the late 1960s and throughout the mid to late 1970s.                        \n\nKGHM's other programming line up also includes, in addition to national sports, programming from Fox Sports Radio. Local sports talk shows are simulcasted with [[KREF|KREF-AM]] 1400 (Another Fox Sports Radio affiliate) in [[Norman Oklahoma]] with KREF-KGHM on air personalities, coverage and broadcasts of local and national sports, local high school and collage Sports. For several years KGHM also carried [[University of Central Oklahoma]] Broncos Football and Men's & Women's Basketball games. KGHM also airs select Oklahoma State Cowboy games (With sister station [[KXXY-FM]].) along with coverage and broadcasting of National Collage Football and Basketball games, selected local Oklahoma high school football games on Friday and Saturday nights, and selected Oklahoma high school basketball games throughout the season alongside sister station [[KTOK]]-AM. Friday Night Finals, a weekly two hour show of state wide High School Football scores and highlights (can also be heard via simulcast with sister station KTOK-AM) from 10:00 to midnight on Friday nights (that runs from first Friday of September til the second or third Friday of November). Game Day Saturday, a look at Collage football games, specifically University of Oklahoma & Oklahoma state football (also simulcast with sister station KTOK-AM). Since 2003, and again from 2006-present, KGHM has carried the games of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] (Formally the Oklahoma RedHawks AKA Oklahoma city RedHawks.) Minor League [[Triple-A baseball]] team, the [[Pacific Coast League]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]). Starting with the 2015 [[Major League Baseball]] season, the station began carrying select [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games as part of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] radio network, alongside sister station [[KTOK]]-AM, on days when the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] are not playing or at the conclusion of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]] [[Triple-A baseball]], [[Pacific Coast League]] season, the remaining parent club [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games move to KGHM for the rest of the [[Major League Baseball]] regular season and playoffs. In late 2018 both KTOK-AM and KGHM-AM's station affiliations with the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network were not renewed for the 2019 Major League Baseball season ending sixteen years of Professional Baseball airing on both stations.\n\n==External links==\n*https://1340thegame.iheart.com\n{{AM station data|KGHM}}\n\n{{Oklahoma City Radio}}\n{{Sports Radio Stations in Oklahoma}}\n{{IHeartMedia}}\n\n{{coord|35|29|28|N|97|30|33|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Oklahoma City|GHM]]\n[[Category:Sports radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Midwest City, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1933]]\n[[Category:IHeartMedia radio stations]]\n[[Category:1933 establishments in Oklahoma]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChanges over the airwaves", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGHM_(AM)"}
