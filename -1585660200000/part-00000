It searches for [[vacuum polarization]] causing nonlinear optical behavior in magnetic fields. Experiments began in 2001 at the INFN [[Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro|Laboratory in Legnaro]] (Padua, Italy) and continue today with new equipment.\n\n== Background ==\nNonlinear electrodynamic effects in vacuum have been predicted since the earliest days of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), a few years after the discovery of [[positron]]s. One such effect is vacuum magnetic birefringence, closely connected to elastic light-by-light interaction. The effect is extremely small and has never yet been observed directly.\nAlthough today QED is a very well-tested theory, the importance of detecting light-by-light interaction remains. First, QED has always been tested in the presence of charged particles either in the initial state or the final state. No tests exist in systems with only photons. More generally, no interaction has ever been observed directly with only gauge bosons present in the initial and final states. Second, to date, the evidence for zero-point quantum fluctuations relies entirely on the observation of the [[Casimir effect]], which applies to photons only. PVLAS deals with the fluctuations of virtual charged particle-antiparticle pairs (of any nature, including hypothetical [[millicharged particle]]s) and therefore the structure of fermionic quantum vacuum: to leading order, it would be a direct detection of loop diagrams. Finally, the observation of light-by-light interaction would be an evidence of the breakdown of the superposition principle and of [[Maxwell's equations]]. One important consequence of a nonlinearity is that the velocity of light would depend on the presence or not of other electromagnetic fields. PVLAS carries out its search by looking at changes in the polarisation state of a  [[Linear polarization|linearly polarised]] [[laser beam]] after it passes through a [[vacuum]] with an intense [[magnetic field]].<ref>[http://www.ts.infn.it/physics/experiments/pvlas/ ''The PVLAS experiment'']</ref>  The birefringence of the vacuum in [[quantum electrodynamics]] by an external field is generally credited to [[Stephen L.

The allegory, at its core, is simple. The Virgin with the aid of her son, whom she holds, tramples on a [[Snake|serpent]], the emblem of [[evil]] or [[original sin]]. [[Saint Anne]], whom the painting is intended to honor, is a wrinkled old grandmother, witnessing the event. Flimsy halos crown the upright; the snake recoils in anti-halos. Both Mary and Jesus are barefoot; Jesus is a fully naked uncircumcised child. All else is mainly shadow, and the figures gain monumentality in the light.\n\nIf this painting was meant to honor the grandmother of Christ, it is unclear how the ungracious depiction of her wrinkled visage in this painting would have been seen as reverent or iconic.

{"title_page": "Benevolence (tax)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n\nA '''benevolence''', also called a '''loving contribution''', '''voluntary contribution''' or '''free gift''', was a type of tax imposed by several [[English monarchs]] from the 15th to 17th centuries. Although taken under the guise of a charitable contribution to the king, the money was in fact extorted from the king's subjects. Commissioners or letters were sent from town to town, detailing the financial need of the king and asking that the town's wealthiest pay up. The requested could not refuse to give, unless they denied the king's need or professed their own poverty, a \"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\" task.{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}} Benevolences allowed the king to raise money outside of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which traditionally had to authorise any tax the king proposed.\n\nA benevolence was first imposed in 1473 by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. It ended lucratively for the king, and he made similar demands leading up to the [[English invasion of Scotland (1482)|1482 invasion of Scotland]] which yielded yet more for the royal coffers. Despite this, the benevolences were extremely unpopular and gained Edward a \"reputation for avarice\". [[Richard III]] attempted to make similar exactions, but met with stringent condemnations of the taxes from Parliament which described them as unjust and unprecedented impositions. Richard's benevolences were not carried out and Parliament ultimately outlawed the practice in 1484.\n\nRichard's deposer [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] freely sidestepped these statues in imposing a benevolence in 1491. His actions were supported by Parliament, although not by the whole populace, and earned him \u00a348,000. [[Henry VIII]] levied yet more benevolences in 1525 and 1545: the first ending in rebellion and withdrawal, and the second ending with a profit of \u00a3120,000. During [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s half-century long reign, benevolences were only raised a few times in the 1580s and 1590s, and then only to small subsets of the population, and raising small amounts. Benevolences had grown increasingly unpopular, criticised by contemporary writers to the ire of Elizabeth's government. The last benevolence of the [[Tudor period]] was levied in 1599.\n\nBenevolences were revived when [[James I]], meeting with an obstinate Parliament, used them to augment his treasury extra-Parliamentarily in 1614. This proved successful, but a further benevolence in 1620 to support [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]] did not, forcing James to call Parliament the following year. No further benevolences were collected, though both James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] took preliminary steps to implement them during their reigns.\n\n==Exaction==\nBenevolence were exacted from the public by methods essentially the same as those of forced loans. Commissioners, typically [[gentlemen]], would travel from town to town supplied with rationales for the benevolence, often relating to the safety of the kingdom, and approach the men of the town to hear this justification and ask for a gift. Alternatively, letters under the monarch's authority were sent to the town's wealthiest individuals emphasising this danger. Benevolences were usually put forth as an alternative to military service in a time of crisis, the subject obliged to help the king in other ways. Legally these contributions were considered voluntary, but in practice subject usually could not refuse once asked, but rather could haggle with the commissioner over how much they would give.{{sfn|Braddick|1996|pp=84-85}} The only way to escape the obligation would be to deny the necessity,{{sfn|Braddick|1996|p=85}} or plead poverty,{{sfn|Harriss|1963|p=17}} a task which was\u2014as one historian has put it\u2014\"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\".{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}}\n\n==Late medieval invention: 1473\u201384==\n[[File:King Edward IV.jpg|thumb|[[Edward IV]] (r. 1461\u201383) was the first English king to impose benevolences.]]\nAccording to English medievalist [[G.

Although taken under the guise of a charitable contribution to the king, the money was in fact extorted from the king's subjects. Commissioners or letters were sent from town to town, detailing the financial need of the king and asking that the town's wealthiest pay up. The requested could not refuse to give, unless they denied the king's need or professed their own poverty, a \"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\" task.{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}} Benevolences allowed the king to raise money outside of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which traditionally had to authorise any tax the king proposed.\n\nA benevolence was first imposed in 1473 by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. It ended lucratively for the king, and he made similar demands leading up to the [[English invasion of Scotland (1482)|1482 invasion of Scotland]] which yielded yet more for the royal coffers. Despite this, the benevolences were extremely unpopular and gained Edward a \"reputation for avarice\". [[Richard III]] attempted to make similar exactions, but met with stringent condemnations of the taxes from Parliament which described them as unjust and unprecedented impositions. Richard's benevolences were not carried out and Parliament ultimately outlawed the practice in 1484.\n\nRichard's deposer [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] freely sidestepped these statues in imposing a benevolence in 1491. His actions were supported by Parliament, although not by the whole populace, and earned him \u00a348,000. [[Henry VIII]] levied yet more benevolences in 1525 and 1545: the first ending in rebellion and withdrawal, and the second ending with a profit of \u00a3120,000. During [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s half-century long reign, benevolences were only raised a few times in the 1580s and 1590s, and then only to small subsets of the population, and raising small amounts. Benevolences had grown increasingly unpopular, criticised by contemporary writers to the ire of Elizabeth's government. The last benevolence of the [[Tudor period]] was levied in 1599.\n\nBenevolences were revived when [[James I]], meeting with an obstinate Parliament, used them to augment his treasury extra-Parliamentarily in 1614. This proved successful, but a further benevolence in 1620 to support [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]] did not, forcing James to call Parliament the following year. No further benevolences were collected, though both James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] took preliminary steps to implement them during their reigns.\n\n==Exaction==\nBenevolence were exacted from the public by methods essentially the same as those of forced loans. Commissioners, typically [[gentlemen]], would travel from town to town supplied with rationales for the benevolence, often relating to the safety of the kingdom, and approach the men of the town to hear this justification and ask for a gift. Alternatively, letters under the monarch's authority were sent to the town's wealthiest individuals emphasising this danger. Benevolences were usually put forth as an alternative to military service in a time of crisis, the subject obliged to help the king in other ways. Legally these contributions were considered voluntary, but in practice subject usually could not refuse once asked, but rather could haggle with the commissioner over how much they would give.{{sfn|Braddick|1996|pp=84-85}} The only way to escape the obligation would be to deny the necessity,{{sfn|Braddick|1996|p=85}} or plead poverty,{{sfn|Harriss|1963|p=17}} a task which was\u2014as one historian has put it\u2014\"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\".{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}}\n\n==Late medieval invention: 1473\u201384==\n[[File:King Edward IV.jpg|thumb|[[Edward IV]] (r. 1461\u201383) was the first English king to impose benevolences.]]\nAccording to English medievalist [[G.

Ekalavya aspired to study archery in the [[gurukul]] of [[Guru]] Drona.\n\nEklavya is called as one of the foremost of kings in the [[Rajasuya]] Yajna where he honours Yudhishthira with his shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eklavya Honouring Yudhishthira|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02052.htm|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eklavya\u2014Foremost of the Kings of Rajasuya Yagna|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02036.htm|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> Though he didn't have his right thumb, he was noted as a very powerful archer and warrior.<ref name=\"Internet Sacred Text Archive\">{{cite web|title=Eklavya\u2014A Powerful Archer and Charioteer|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02043.htm|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Self-training ===\nIn the [[Mahabharata]], Ekalavya was the adopted son of Hiranyadhanus, who was the chief of Bheel tribe , known to be forest dwelling hunters . He served under [[Jarasandha|King Jarasandha']]s army as General. Ekalavya was in fact the biological son of Devashrava who was the brother of Vasudeva , father of [[Krishna]] and [[Balrama]].His birth name was Shatrughan .Ekalavya was hurt when he was rejected by dronacharya on the basis of his caste, Ekalavya still didn't give up on his resolute will to master archery. He once stayed hidden in the forest while guru Drona was teaching the Kaurava and Pandava brothers, after they left to the ashram, Ekalavya collected the mud on which his Guru walked, as a symbolic gesture of want to follow his knowledge and foot steps, later he went into the forest and made a statue of Drona under a big old well grown tree. He accepted the statue as his guru and practiced in front of it every single day.\n\n=== Guru dakshina ===\nOne day when Drona and his students were going out into the forest, Arjuna saw a dog that was unable to bark due to an amazing construction of arrows in and all around his mouth. This construction was harmless to the dog, but prevented the dog from barking. Drona was amazed, but also distressed:as he had promised Arjuna that he would make him the greatest archer in the world. Drona and his students investigated, and came upon Ekalavya. Upon seeing Drona, Ekalavya came and bowed to him.\n\nDrona asked Ekalavya where he had learnt archery. Ekalavya replied \"under you, Guruji\", and showed Drona his statue while explaining what he had done.\n\nDrona then reminded Ekalavya that to truly be Drona's pupil, Ekalavya would have to pay [[dakshina|guru dakshina]]. Readily, Ekalavya offers to do anything for Drona.Fearing that with his present skill and determination , he will surpass his dearest pupil Arjuna in future , Drona stoically asks for the thumb from Ekalavya's right hand. Hesitant at first, Eklavya asks for Drona to confirm the command; Drona harshly does so. Happy and Smiling, Ekalavya  cuts off the thumb and present it as gurudakshina to dronacharya.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nLater, Ekalavya worked as an archer of King [[Jarasandha]]. When Jarasandha planned to besiege [[Mathura]], he was aided by Eklavya who was a skillful archer. Eklavya also helped Jarasandha and [[Shishupala]] by chasing [[Rukmini]] while she eloped with [[Krishna]]. After Jarasandha's demise, Ekalavya sought to avenge him by campaigning to destroy [[Kuntibhoja]] and every [[Yadava]] in [[Dwarka]]. During the attack, he was slayed by Krishna.<ref name=\"ADAthawale_vastav\">A. D. Athawale. ''Vastav Darshan of Mahabharat''.

He possessed the mighty bow Pashupath. He is known to have defeated Krishna in an archery combat.\n\n== Early life ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Self-training ===\nIn the [[Mahabharata]], Ekalavya was the adopted son of Hiranyadhanus, who was the chief of Bheel tribe , known to be forest dwelling hunters . He served under [[Jarasandha|King Jarasandha']]s army as General. Ekalavya was in fact the biological son of Devashrava who was the brother of Vasudeva , father of [[Krishna]] and [[Balrama]].His birth name was Shatrughan .Ekalavya was hurt when he was rejected by dronacharya on the basis of his caste, Ekalavya still didn't give up on his resolute will to master archery. He once stayed hidden in the forest while guru Drona was teaching the Kaurava and Pandava brothers, after they left to the ashram, Ekalavya collected the mud on which his Guru walked, as a symbolic gesture of want to follow his knowledge and foot steps, later he went into the forest and made a statue of Drona under a big old well grown tree. He began a disciplined program of self-study over many years. Eventually, Ekalavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, greater than Drona's best pupil, [[Arjuna]]. He accepted the statue as his guru and practiced in front of it every single day.\n\n=== Guru dakshina ===\nOne day when Drona and his students were going out into the forest, Arjuna saw a dog that was unable to bark due to an amazing construction of arrows in and all around his mouth. This construction was harmless to the dog, but prevented the dog from barking. Drona was amazed, but also distressed:as he had promised Arjuna that he would make him the greatest archer in the world. Drona and his students investigated, and came upon Ekalavya. Upon seeing Drona, Ekalavya came and bowed to him.\n\nDrona asked Ekalavya where he had learnt archery. Ekalavya replied \"under you, Guruji\", and showed Drona his statue while explaining what he had done.\n\nDrona then reminded Ekalavya that to truly be Drona's pupil, Ekalavya would have to pay [[dakshina|guru dakshina]]. Readily, Ekalavya offers to do anything for Drona.Fearing that with his present skill and determination , he will surpass his dearest pupil Arjuna in future , Drona stoically asks for the thumb from Ekalavya's right hand. Hesitant at first, Eklavya asks for Drona to confirm the command; Drona harshly does so. Happy and Smiling, Ekalavya  cuts off the thumb and present it as gurudakshina to dronacharya.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nLater, Ekalavya worked as an archer of King [[Jarasandha]]. When Jarasandha planned to besiege [[Mathura]], he was aided by Eklavya who was a skillful archer. Eklavya also helped Jarasandha and [[Shishupala]] by chasing [[Rukmini]] while she eloped with [[Krishna]]. After Jarasandha's demise, Ekalavya sought to avenge him by campaigning to destroy [[Kuntibhoja]] and every [[Yadava]] in [[Dwarka]].

The element is named after the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in the United States, which collaborated with the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of [[Livermore, California]] where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner [[Robert Livermore]].

{"title_page": "Salian dynasty", "text_new": "{{redirect|Salian|the city in Azerbaijan|Salyan, Azerbaijan|the village in Iran|Salian, Iran}}\n{{see also|Salian Franks|Salic law}}\n\nThe '''Salian dynasty''' ({{lang-de|Salier}}; also known as the '''Frankish dynasty''' after the family's [[Salian Franks|Salian Frankish]] origin and position as dukes of [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]]) was a [[dynasty]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The dynasty provided four [[List of German Kings and Emperors#Kings|German Kings]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1027\u20131125); as such, the term ''Salic dynasty'' is also used to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the time as a separate term.\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] in 1024, the [[Elective monarchy|elective]] titles of [[King of the Germans]] and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], the only son of [[Henry of Speyer|Count Henry of Speyer]] and [[Adelheid of Alsace]] (both territories in the Franconia of the day). He was elected German King in 1024 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 26 March 1027.\n\nThe four Salian kings of the dynasty\u2014[[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]\u2014ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 to 1125 and firmly established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Name==\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]] did not use the term \"Salian\" in his biography of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], around 1044. He stated that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the Frankish [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely etimology connects the family name with the old German term ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document using it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], himself the first Salian monarchs' maternal descendant, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four Salian monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the use of this term have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]]. Conrad the Red was most probably named for his uncle, King [[Conrad I of Germany]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=323}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Salian family tree]]\n\n[[Werner V (Salian)|Werner]] of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and his son Duke [[Conrad the Red]] of Lorraine, who died in 955, founded the ancestral dynasty. Conrad the Red married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], a daughter of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto I]]. Their son [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia]] ruled Carinthia from 978 to 1004.\n\nDuke Otto had three sons: Bruno, who became [[Pope Gregory V]]; Conrad; and [[Henry of Speyer|Henry]], count of [[Speyer]]. Henry was the father of the first Salian Emperor Conrad II.\n\n[[Pope Leo IX]] (in office 1049 to 1054) also had family ties to the dynasty, since his grandfather Hugo III was the brother of Adelheid, the grandmother of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]].\n\n==Ruling in the Holy Roman Empire==\nAfter the death of the last Saxon Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] the first Salian regent Conrad II was elected by the majority of the [[Prince-elector]]s and was crowned German king in [[Mainz]] on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.\n\nAccording to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Salian Kings and Emperors==\n{{Salian dynasty}}\n* [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] 1024\u20131039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027\n* [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] 1039\u20131056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046\n* [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] 1056\u20131106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084\n** [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad (III)]] 1087\u20131098, nominal king under his father Henry IV\n* [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] 1106\u20131125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111\n\nTheir regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]].\n\n==Family tree of Salians==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | Ott | | Wer |Ott=[[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]<br>king of Germany<br>|Wer=[[Werner V (Salian)|Werner]]<br>count of Speyergau, Wormsgau<br>'''SALIANS'''<br><small>\u221e Hicha of Swabia<br>(daughter of [[Burchard II, Duke of Swabia|Burchard II]])}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!| }}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | Liu |~| Cor |Liu=[[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgard of Saxony]]<br>[[Ottonian dynasty|OTTONIAN]]|Cor=[[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad]] the Red<br>duke of Lorraine}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | Co1 | | Ot1 |Co1=[[Conrad I of Burgundy|Conrad I]]<br>king of Burgundy|Ot1=[[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto I]]<br>duke of Carinthia<br><small>\u221e Judith of Carinthia (?)}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | Ger | | Hen | | Gre | | Crd |Ger=[[Gerberga of Burgundy]]<br>[[Elder House of Welf|ELDER WELFS]]|Hen=[[Henry of Speyer|Henry]]<br>count of Speyer, Worms<br><small>\u221e [[Adelaide of Metz]]|Gre=[[Pope Gregory V]]|Crd=[[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I]]<br>duke of Carinthia<br><small>\u221e [[Matilda of Swabia]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |)|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | Gis |~| Co2 | | | | | | Cnr | | Bru |Co2=[[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] the Elder<br>king of Germany, Italy, Burgundy|Gis=[[Gisela of Swabia]]<br>[[Conradines|CONRADINES]]|Cnr=[[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad II]] the Younger<br>duke of Carinthia|Bru=[[Bruno (bishop of W\u00fcrzburg)|Bruno]]<br>bishop of W\u00fcrzburg}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | He3 |~| wif |He3=[[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]<br>king of Germany, Italy, Burgundy|wif=1.[[Gunhilda of Denmark]]<br>2.[[Agnes of Poitou]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | || |)|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | He4 |~| wfe | | Cnd |He4=[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]<br>king of Germany, Italy, Burgundy|Cnd=[[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad II]]<br>duke of Bavaria|wfe=1.[[Bertha of Savoy]]<br>2.[[Eupraxia of Kiev]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|(| }}\n{{familytree | Fr1 |~| Agn |~| Le3 | | Cor | | He5 |Agn=[[Agnes of Waiblingen]]|Fr1=1.[[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia|Frederick I]]<br>duke of Swabia|Le3=2.[[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria|Leopold III]]<br>margrave of Austria|Cor=[[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]]<br>co-king of Germany, Italy|He5=[[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]<br>king of Germany, Italy<br><small>\u221e [[Empress Matilda|Matilda of Normandy]]}}\n{{familytree | |!}}\n{{familytree | Co3 |Co3=[[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]]<br>king of Germany<br>[[Hohenstaufen|HOHENSTAUFEN]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concordat of Worms]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Weinfurter|first=Stefan|orig-year=1992|year=1999|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|translator-last=Kaiser|translator-first=Denise A.|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-89122-3508-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Herwig|authorlink=Herwig Wolfram|orig-year=2000|year=2006|title=Conrad II, 990\u20131039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms|translator-last=Bowlus|translator-first=Barbara M.|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-02738-X|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Lenelotte M\u00f6ller, Hans Ammerich: Die Salier. 1024-1125.

The dynasty provided four [[List of German Kings and Emperors#Kings|German Kings]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1027\u20131125); as such, the term ''Salic dynasty'' is also used to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the time as a separate term.\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] in 1024, the [[Elective monarchy|elective]] titles of [[King of the Germans]] and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], the only son of [[Henry of Speyer|Count Henry of Speyer]] and [[Adelheid of Alsace]] (both territories in the Franconia of the day). He was elected German King in 1024 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 26 March 1027.\n\nThe four Salian kings of the dynasty\u2014[[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]\u2014ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 to 1125 and firmly established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Name==\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]] did not use the term \"Salian\" in his biography of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], that he completed around 1044. He stated that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the Frankish [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely etimology connects the family name with the old German term ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document using it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], himself the first Salian monarchs' maternal descendant, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four Salian monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the use of this term have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]]. Conrad the Red was most probably named for his uncle, King [[Conrad I of Germany]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=323}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Salian family tree]]\n\n[[Werner V (Salian)|Werner]] of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and his son Duke [[Conrad the Red]] of Lorraine, who died in 955, founded the ancestral dynasty. Conrad the Red married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], a daughter of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto I]]. Their son [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia]] ruled Carinthia from 978 to 1004.\n\nDuke Otto had three sons: Bruno, who became [[Pope Gregory V]]; Conrad; and [[Henry of Speyer|Henry]], count of [[Speyer]]. Henry was the father of the first Salian Emperor Conrad II.\n\n[[Pope Leo IX]] (in office 1049 to 1054) also had family ties to the dynasty, since his grandfather Hugo III was the brother of Adelheid, the grandmother of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]].\n\n==Ruling in the Holy Roman Empire==\nAfter the death of the last Saxon Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] the first Salian regent Conrad II was elected by the majority of the [[Prince-elector]]s and was crowned German king in [[Mainz]] on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord.
