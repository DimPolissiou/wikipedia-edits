Yasser Seirawan has given [[simultaneous exhibition]]s for the game. The first ever event was a 12 board simultaneous exhibition held March 31, 2007 in Vancouver, Canada.<ref>[http://www.chessmastery.com/seirawan-simul.html Seirawan chess simultaneous], photos and videos.</ref>\n\n== Rules ==\nThe initial position is that of standard [[chess]]. Each side has additionally two pieces in hand (a hawk and an elephant):\n* [[File:Chess cll44.png|Elephant|30px]] The [[Empress (chess)|elephant]], moves as a [[rook (chess)|rook]] or a [[knight (chess)|knight]]; (this piece is better known as [[Empress (chess)|Chancellor or Empress]]) and\n* [[File:Chess all44.png|Hawk|30px]] The [[Princess (chess)|hawk]], moves as a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] or a [[Knight (chess)|knight]]. (this piece is better known as [[Princess (chess)|Archbishop or Princess]]).\n\nThe elephant and the hawk are introduced to the game in the following way: whenever the player moves a [[Chess piece|piece]] (king, queen, knight, bishop or rook) from its starting position (that hasn't already been moved), one of the pieces in hand may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. One cannot use the placing of an elephant or hawk to block [[check (chess)|check]]. If the player moves all his pieces from the first [[list of chess terms#R|rank]] without placing one or both in hand pieces, he forfeits the right to do so. After [[castling]], the player may put one of the pieces in hand on either the [[king (chess)|king's]] or the rook's square, but he may not place both pieces in hand in the same turn. Pawns may [[promotion (chess)|promote]] to a hawk or an elephant in this game (in addition to the normal [[chess piece]]s).\n\nWhen notating games in [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]], the letter '''E''' is used for the Elephant and '''H''' for the Hawk. If the player places one of the two pieces on the board, it is written after a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]. For example, '''1. Nc3/E''' means that the player moved his knight from '''b1''' to '''c3''' and placed the elephant on '''b1''' (see diagram).\n\n== Name ==\n\nSeirawan has expressed dissatisfaction with the name ''Seirawan chess'', noting that the variant was a joint development with friend Bruce Harper.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Seirawan, Yasser |date=2008-01-28  |title=GM Yasser Seirawan Introduces Seirawan Chess |type=YouTube video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nht2TqabPr0 |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> The name SHARPER chess (a combination of the names Seirawan and Harper) has been suggested.

Yasser Seirawan has given [[simultaneous exhibition]]s for the game. The first ever event was a 12 board simultaneous exhibition held March 31, 2007 in Vancouver, Canada.<ref>[http://www.chessmastery.com/seirawan-simul.html Seirawan chess simultaneous], photos and videos.</ref>\n\n== Rules ==\nThe initial position is that of standard [[chess]]. Each side has additionally two pieces in hand (a hawk and an elephant):\n* [[File:Chess cll44.png|Elephant|30px]] The [[Empress (chess)|elephant]], moves as a [[rook (chess)|rook]] or a [[knight (chess)|knight]]; (this piece is better known as [[Empress (chess)|Chancellor or Empress]]) and\n* [[File:Chess all44.png|Hawk|30px]] The [[Princess (chess)|hawk]], moves as a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] or a [[Knight (chess)|knight]]. (this piece is better know as [[Princess (chess)|Archbishop or Princess]]).\n\nThe elephant and the hawk are introduced to the game in the following way: whenever the player moves a [[Chess piece|piece]] (king, queen, knight, bishop or rook) from its starting position (that hasn't already been moved), one of the pieces in hand may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. One cannot use the placing of an elephant or hawk to block [[check (chess)|check]]. If the player moves all his pieces from the first [[list of chess terms#R|rank]] without placing one or both in hand pieces, he forfeits the right to do so. After [[castling]], the player may put one of the pieces in hand on either the [[king (chess)|king's]] or the rook's square, but he may not place both pieces in hand in the same turn. Pawns may [[promotion (chess)|promote]] to a hawk or an elephant in this game (in addition to the normal [[chess piece]]s).\n\nWhen notating games in [[algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation]], the letter '''E''' is used for the Elephant and '''H''' for the Hawk. If the player places one of the two pieces on the board, it is written after a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]. For example, '''1. Nc3/E''' means that the player moved his knight from '''b1''' to '''c3''' and placed the elephant on '''b1''' (see diagram).\n\n== Name ==\n\nSeirawan has expressed dissatisfaction with the name ''Seirawan chess'', noting that the variant was a joint development with friend Bruce Harper.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Seirawan, Yasser |date=2008-01-28  |title=GM Yasser Seirawan Introduces Seirawan Chess |type=YouTube video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nht2TqabPr0 |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> The name SHARPER chess (a combination of the names Seirawan and Harper) has been suggested.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 56,657.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1705573| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Berwyn city, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore being settled, the land that is now Berwyn was traversed by Native American trails.  The most important trails converged near the Chicago portage, and two significant routes crossed what is today Berwyn.  A branch of the Trail to Green Bay crossed Berwyn at what is now Riverside Drive, and the Ottawa Trail spanned the southern end of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://drupal.library.cmu.edu/chicago/node/132|title=The Chicago Portage - Historical Synopsis {{!}} Chicago Portage|website=drupal.library.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the first land in \"Berwyn\" was deeded to Theodore Doty who built the {{convert|8|ft|m|-wide|adj=mid}} [[Plank Road]] from Chicago to [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] along the Ottawa Trail.  The trail had been used as a French and Indian trade route and more recently as a stage coach route to Lisle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westernspringshistory.org/2013/08/21/ogden-avenue-street-with-a-real-history/|title=Ogden Avenue \u2026 Street with a Real History {{!}} Western Springs Historical Society|website=www.westernspringshistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref> This thoroughfare became what is now Ogden Avenue in South Berwyn. In 1856, Thomas F. Baldwin purchased {{convert|347|acre|km2}} of land, bordered by what is now Ogden Avenue, Ridgeland Avenue, 31st Street, and Harlem Avenue, in hopes of developing a rich and aristocratic community called \"LaVergne\".<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.berwyn-il.gov/?q=about_berwyn|title=About Berwyn - City of Berwyn|publisher=}}</ref>  However, few people were interested in grassy marshland. Mud Lake extended nearly to the southern border of today's Berwyn, and the land flooded regularly during heavy rains. The only mode of transportation to LaVergne was horse and buggy on the Plank Road.\n\nTo encourage people to move to LaVergne, Baldwin sold an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} strip of property to the Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1862. The rail line opened in 1864, but the train did not stop regularly in the area. The railroad refused to build a station, so the residents of the area constructed LaVergne Station on Ridgeland Avenue in 1874.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\"/>\n\nHowever, the financial [[panic of 1873]] and Baldwin's death in 1876 stunted the growth of LaVergne. Baldwin's daughter, Emma, inherited her father's estate, and in 1879 she sold most of the land to a group of realtors controlled by [[Marshall Field]]. The new development enacted building codes and stipulated the minimum building cost of each home. By the end of 1880, 12 new homes were built. By 1888, the settlement had grown so much that the Baldwin family donated the triangular piece of land bounded by Ogden Avenue, 34th Street, and Gunderson Avenue so that a school could be built.  LaVergne School became the first public building in Berwyn.\n\nIn 1890, Charles E. Piper and Wilbur J. Andrews, two Chicago attorneys, purchased a {{convert|106|acre|km2|adj=on}} plot of land from the Field syndicate to develop. The land was bounded by Wesley, Kenilworth, 31st Street, and Ogden Avenues. By the following year, the two received approval from [[Cicero Township, Cook County, Illinois|Cicero Township]] to double their land holdings.\n\nPiper and Andrews wanted the railroad to build a station in their development, but the railroad already had stations at [[La Vergne (Metra)|La Vergne]] and at [[Harlem Avenue (Metra)|Harlem Avenue]]. Piper and Andrews decided to build a station with the understanding that trains would stop regularly. They did not know what to name their station so they consulted a Pennsylvania train timetable to find a name. The name they chose was [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], a [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] suburb of [[Philadelphia]] noted for its beauty. After 1901, all settlements in the area were known as Berwyn.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\" />\n[[File:Berwyn, Illinois 1895 Sanborn Map Composite.jpg|thumb|Sanborn Fire Maps show the development of the Berwyn subdivision by 1895.]]\nWhile Piper and Andrews were developing the southern portion of present-day Berwyn, John Kelly was helping to develop the north part from [[Roosevelt Road|12th Street]] to 16th Street. This area was really a part of an [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] subdivision, and it even appeared on some maps as \"South Oak Park\". In fact, children who lived in this area went to school in Oak Park. John Kelly was known as \"Mr. Everything\" because he was a realtor, builder, insurance seller, and community servant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berwynhistoricalsociety.org/2009/06/south-oak-park/|title=South Oak Park|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn between the two settlements, there was little except for a few farms. The area between 16th and 31st streets was not settled. There were only two paths by which to travel between the two settlements, and today these paths are known as Oak Park Avenue and Ridgeland Avenue. Although Berwyn was chartered as a city in 1908, it was not until the 1920s that this middle portion of land was developed.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Berwyn was the area's fastest growing suburb. The city's stringent building codes resulted in block upon block of well-built brick two-story [[Bungalow#Chicago bungalow|bungalows]]. Many also contained elaborate design elements typically not seen, such as stained glass windows, clay tile roofs, [[terra cotta]], and intricate brick patterns. Today, Berwyn is noted as having the most significant collection of Chicago-style bungalows in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/ct-mre-0705-berwyn-bungalows-recognition-20150627-story.html|title=Berwyn bungalows one step closer to national historic recognition - Chicago Tribune|author=Chicago Tribune|date=27 June 2015|work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"mbox-small\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px solid #aaa; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;border-top:none;\"| '''[[Demographics]] (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=17:1705573|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121211221809/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=17:1705573|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-11|title=2010 United States Census Data|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[White American|White]]'''\n| '''[[African American|Black]]'''\n| '''[[Asian American|Asian]]'''\n|-\n| 60.5%\n| 6.4%\n| 2.5%\n|-\n| '''[[Pacific Islander American|Islander]]'''\n| '''[[Native Americans in the United States|Native]]'''\n| '''Other'''\n| '''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic<br>(any race)]]'''\n|-\n| 0.03%\n| 0.6%\n| 30.0%\n| 59.4%\n|}\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 5841\n|1920= 14150\n|1930= 47027\n|1940= 48451\n|1950= 51280\n|1960= 54224\n|1970= 52502\n|1980= 46849\n|1990= 45426\n|2000= 54016\n|2010= 56657\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=54917\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 56,657 people and 18,910 households in the city.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 56,657.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1705573| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Berwyn city, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore being settled, the land that is now Berwyn was traversed by Native American trails.  The most important trails converged near the Chicago portage, and two significant routes crossed what is today Berwyn.  A branch of the Trail to Green Bay crossed Berwyn at what is now Riverside Drive, and the Ottawa Trail spanned the southern end of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://drupal.library.cmu.edu/chicago/node/132|title=The Chicago Portage - Historical Synopsis {{!}} Chicago Portage|website=drupal.library.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the first land in \"Berwyn\" was deeded to Theodore Doty who built the {{convert|8|ft|m|-wide|adj=mid}} [[Plank Road]] from Chicago to [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] along the Ottawa Trail.  The trail had been used as a French and Indian trade route and more recently as a stage coach route to Lisle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westernspringshistory.org/2013/08/21/ogden-avenue-street-with-a-real-history/|title=Ogden Avenue \u2026 Street with a Real History {{!}} Western Springs Historical Society|website=www.westernspringshistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref> This thoroughfare became what is now Ogden Avenue in South Berwyn. In 1856, Thomas F. Baldwin purchased {{convert|347|acre|km2}} of land, bordered by what is now Ogden Avenue, Ridgeland Avenue, 31st Street, and Harlem Avenue, in hopes of developing a rich and aristocratic community called \"LaVergne\".<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.berwyn-il.gov/?q=about_berwyn|title=About Berwyn - City of Berwyn|publisher=}}</ref>  However, few people were interested in grassy marshland. Mud Lake extended nearly to the southern border of today's Berwyn, and the land flooded regularly during heavy rains. The only mode of transportation to LaVergne was horse and buggy on the Plank Road.\n\nTo encourage people to move to LaVergne, Baldwin sold an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} strip of property to the Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1862. The rail line opened in 1864, but the train did not stop regularly in the area. The railroad refused to build a station, so the residents of the area constructed LaVergne Station on Ridgeland Avenue in 1874.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\"/>\n\nHowever, the financial [[panic of 1873]] and Baldwin's death in 1876 stunted the growth of LaVergne. Baldwin's daughter, Emma, inherited her father's estate, and in 1879 she sold most of the land to a group of realtors controlled by [[Marshall Field]]. The new development enacted building codes and stipulated the minimum building cost of each home. By the end of 1880, 12 new homes were built. By 1888, the settlement had grown so much that the Baldwin family donated the triangular piece of land bounded by Ogden Avenue, 34th Street, and Gunderson Avenue so that a school could be built.  LaVergne School became the first public building in Berwyn.\n\nIn 1890, Charles E. Piper and Wilbur J. Andrews, two Chicago attorneys, purchased a {{convert|106|acre|km2|adj=on}} plot of land from the Field syndicate to develop. The land was bounded by Wesley, Kenilworth, 31st Street, and Ogden Avenues. By the following year, the two received approval from [[Cicero Township, Cook County, Illinois|Cicero Township]] to double their land holdings.\n\nPiper and Andrews wanted the railroad to build a station in their development, but the railroad already had stations at [[La Vergne (Metra)|La Vergne]] and at [[Harlem Avenue (Metra)|Harlem Avenue]]. Piper and Andrews decided to build a station with the understanding that trains would stop regularly. They did not know what to name their station so they consulted a Pennsylvania train timetable to find a name. The name they chose was [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], a [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] suburb of [[Philadelphia]] noted for its beauty. After 1901, all settlements in the area were known as Berwyn.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\" />\n[[File:Berwyn, Illinois 1895 Sanborn Map Composite.jpg|thumb|Sanborn Fire Maps show the development of the Berwyn subdivision by 1895.]]\nWhile Piper and Andrews were developing the southern portion of present-day Berwyn, John Kelly was helping to develop the north part from [[Roosevelt Road|12th Street]] to 16th Street. This area was really a part of an [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] subdivision, and it even appeared on some maps as \"South Oak Park\". In fact, children who lived in this area went to school in Oak Park. John Kelly was known as \"Mr. Everything\" because he was a realtor, builder, insurance seller, and community servant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berwynhistoricalsociety.org/2009/06/south-oak-park/|title=South Oak Park|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn between the two settlements, there was little except for a few farms. The area between 16th and 31st streets was not settled. There were only two paths by which to travel between the two settlements, and today these paths are known as Oak Park Avenue and Ridgeland Avenue. Although Berwyn was chartered as a city in 1908, it was not until the 1920s that this middle portion of land was developed.<ref name=\"berwyn-il.gov1\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Berwyn was the area's fastest growing suburb. The city's stringent building codes resulted in block upon block of well-built brick two-story [[Bungalow#Chicago bungalow|bungalows]]. Many also contained elaborate design elements typically not seen, such as stained glass windows, clay tile roofs, [[terra cotta]], and intricate brick patterns. Today, Berwyn is noted as having the most significant collection of Chicago-style bungalows in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/ct-mre-0705-berwyn-bungalows-recognition-20150627-story.html|title=Berwyn bungalows one step closer to national historic recognition - Chicago Tribune|author=Chicago Tribune|date=27 June 2015|work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"mbox-small\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px solid #aaa; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;border-top:none;\"| '''[[Demographics]] (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=17:1705573|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121211221809/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=17:1705573|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-11|title=2010 United States Census Data|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[White American|White]]'''\n| '''[[African American|Black]]'''\n| '''[[Asian American|Asian]]'''\n|-\n| 60.5%\n| 6.4%\n| 2.5%\n|-\n| '''[[Pacific Islander American|Islander]]'''\n| '''[[Native Americans in the United States|Native]]'''\n| '''Other'''\n| '''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic<br>(any race)]]'''\n|-\n| 0.03%\n| 0.6%\n| 30.0%\n| 59.4%\n|}\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 5841\n|1920= 14150\n|1930= 47027\n|1940= 48451\n|1950= 51280\n|1960= 54224\n|1970= 52502\n|1980= 46849\n|1990= 45426\n|2000= 54016\n|2010= 56657\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=54917\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 56,657 people and 18,910 households in the city.

A rehabilitation center operated with MacNeal Memorial Hospital is present as well.\n\nThe following table includes a complete list of Berwyn's public parks and recreational centers:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |North Berwyn Park District\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Berwyn Park District\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Berwyn Recreation Department\n|-\n|Community Center / Pyrce Park\n|16th & Wesley\n|\n|Freedom Park\n|3701 Scoville\n|\n|Rec Center / Pavek Pool\n|6501 W. 31st\n|-\n|Berwyn Gardens\n|Maple & Cermak\n|\n|Friendship Park\n|25th & Kenilworth\n|\n|Janura Park\n|28th & East\n|-\n|Jefferson Field\n|16th & Wenonah\n|\n|Hessler Park\n|34th & Kenilworth\n|\n|Baseball Alley\n|East Ave. & 29th\n|-\n|Kriz Park\n|15th & Maple\n|\n|Karasek Park\n|Windsor & Kenilworth\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Unity Park\n|1227 Kenilworth\n|\n|Karban Park\n|East & Ogden Alleys\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Hett Park\n|19th & Cuyler\n|\n|Liberty Cultural Center\n|6445 W. 27th Pl\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Mraz Park\n|Oak Park & Riverside Dr\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Proksa Park\n|3001 S.

The town also has many duplexes and three unit buildings.  Because of the predominance of small residences in Berwyn, the community has an unusually low carbon footprint.  According to data published by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, Berwyn had the lowest per capita CO2 emissions from homes and private vehicles in the Chicago area.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9780803296886/ |last=Subak|first=Susan|title=The Five-Ton Life|date=2018|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nBerwyn has one of the world's largest [[laundromat]]s, {{convert|13500|sqft|m2}} in size, with 161 washers and 140 dryers, a kids' play area, big screen TVs, a bird sanctuary, and free pizza on Wednesday nights.<ref>''[[Reader's Digest]]'', May 2006, p. 94.</ref> It incurred extensive damage from an electrical fire in 2004 but was rebuilt in early 2006.
