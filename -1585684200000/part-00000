The flowers can range in color from white, to pale pink or lavender.  The leaves of the plant are [[leaf shape|lanceolate]] to ovate in shape, ranging from 6\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 2&nbsp;cm wide, with three parallel veins.  The leaves are larger and more numerous near the base of the stem. (Patrick, Krakow, 1995)\n\nThe plant typically flowers from mid-May through June, with fruit being produced in July and August.  (Tsao, Van Lonkhuyzen, 2000)  The fruit is a 5-angled, 10-ribbed [[achene]], about 4&nbsp;mm long, with a hairy, resin-dotted surface. The fruit is topped by a crown ([[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]) of five, narrowly triangular, sharply pointed scales, which are 1\u20133&nbsp;mm long. The fruits are found among the sharply pointed [[bract]]s ([[chaff]]), which persist on the flower head. (Patrick, Krakow, 1995)\n\n==Habitat==\n\nThe Mohr's Barbara's buttons, ''Marshallia mohrii'', requires wet, sandy clay soils, with [[Alkali soils|alkaline pH]], and high organic matter.  Most currently known populations occur on soils of the Conasauga-Firestone Association. (Alabama Power Company, 2007)  This is typically found along shale-bedded streams, especially in seasonally moist forest gaps, and in low [[swale (geographic feature)|swales]] extending onto roadside rights-of-way.  Mohr\u2019s Barbara Button can survive in full sun or partial shade, often in association with grass-sedge communities.  Two other endangered species have the same habitat requirements as the Mohr\u2019s Barbara Button: The Alabama Leather-Flower and the [[Green Pitcher Plant]] are both listed as endangered, and occupy the same limited habitat. (Alabama Power Company, 2007)\n\n==Conservation==\n\n===Threats===\nMohr's Barbara's buttons suffers primarily from habitat loss due to residential development, road maintenance and enlargement, trash disposal, and to a small extent, agricultural development. Because the environments in which Mohr's Barbara's buttons exists are typically alkaline, sandy soils, crop production is not typically favorable in these environments.\n\nAlthough direct human destruction of habitat can be blamed for population declines, too much human influence in protecting it can be problematic as well. [[Wildfire suppression|Fire suppression]] in the pine and oak forests of the southeast United States has also taken its toll on the Mohr's Barbara's buttons. Although the species requires mature pine and oak forests to survive, without occasional fires, the glades and openings required by the species become overgrown with forest vegetation. Therefore the trees and habitat needed by the Mohr's Barbara's buttons, and protected through fire suppression can become a major problem as well for the species.  (Matthews, 1994)\n\nAnother risk many species face, especially plant species, is [[habitat fragmentation]].  As habitat gets destroyed, it is common that individual populations get isolated from each other.  As populations get isolated from each other, and members of differing populations cannot interact, the [[genetic variation]] within populations starts to decrease.  If populations are not able to interact for many generations, a loss of genetic diversity with populations, and the species as a whole become a very real problem. Luckily, habitat fragmentation and a lack of genetic variation is not a problem for Mohr\u2019s Barbara Button, as the species has more variation than most others in its environment.  Also, the genetic variation within populations is greater than amongst populations.  (Jolls)\n\n===Protection methods===\n\nThere are many stakeholders involved in protecting the Mohr's Barbara's buttons.  The [[Calcareous grassland|calcareous glades]] necessary for the survival of Mohr's Barbara's buttons used to be fairly common and widespread.  Currently, the remaining areas predominantly exist on private land, with none on federally protected land.  Therefore landowners are one of the most important stakeholders involved.  But, government and private organizations in charge of protecting plant species need to educate and work with private landowners to ensure the protection and survival of the habitat required for Mohr's Barbara's buttons.\n\nGovernment organizations are also necessary to protect habitat, as road construction and urban development is a major cause of [[habitat destruction]].  Therefore, an adequate examination of the land should occur prior to zoning, construction and/or development.  Also, even if the land is safe from construction or development, it has to be protected from the effects of human population.  Garbage and waste disposal can pollute and destroy critical habitat, as well as over-use by grazing livestock.\n\nPresently, the [[Nature Conservancy]] has purchased several areas with calcareous glades and marly prairies, to ensure the survival of the Mohr's Barbara's buttons and those endangered species that occupy the same habitat.  They are also working with landowners to protect those areas that are found on private land.  (Schotz, 2001)  Through habitat protection by private and public sectors, the Mohr's Barbara's buttons and other endangered species can survive and flourish for future generations.\n\nBecause some populations have become established in road right-of-ways and ditches, it is important to check road ditches before mowing or construction.  This ensures no populations that have established in road right-of-ways are destroyed.  Simply not mowing an area of roadside will not detract from the aesthetics of an area, and will protect valuable individuals/populations.\n\n====Reasons to protect====\n\nThe Mohr's Barbara's buttons is a wildflower [[endemism|endemic]] to the United States.  Protecting habitat does not require setting aside large tracts of valuable land.  The land its habitat primarily occupies is low in value, and not highly desired for agricultural production.\n\nSince the Mohr's Barbara's buttons is a plant, it cannot migrate to another area that is more suitable, or safer.  For this reason, Mohr's Barbara's buttons, as with most plants, is susceptible to major population loss due to habitat degradation or destruction.  Therefore humans need to protect the environments these plants require to survive.  Since Mohr's Barbara's buttons has a very distinct and limited habitat, it is vital to protect these habitats as a whole, as they are important to several other threatened and endangered species as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Tsao, C.

The park consisted primarily of water-based attractions and originally opened to the public in 1978, under the ownership of Great American Recreation (GAR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601072125/http://waterpark.mountaincreek.com/park/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |title=Action Park Waterpark, Vernon NJ |website=Mountain Creek |accessdate=April 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAction Park featured three separate attraction areas: the Alpine Center, Motorworld, and Waterworld.

In its later years, [[Tort|personal injury]] lawsuits led to the closure of increasing numbers of rides, and eventually the entire park closed, in 1996.\n\nOn February 9, 1998, resort developer [[Intrawest]] announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861</ref> The park received a massive overhaul, which included extensively renovating and repairing attractions, especially those deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, with some being removed entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|title=New Water Park At Vernon Valley Scheduled To Open June 15|website=actionpark.com|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|archive-date=1998-04-25}}</ref>Afterwards, the park reopened as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|footer_align=center|perrow = 1|total_width=200\n| image1 = Action Park (3000196846).jpg | caption1 = Landing at the end of a waterslide\n| image2 = Action Park (3000201136).jpg | caption2 = Mini-slide built into the side of a mountain\n}}\nThe idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined [[Mountain Creek|Vernon Valley/Great Gorge]] ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] down one of the steep ski trails.<ref>{{cite news|title=So What If There's No Snow, Go Sliding Down Hill Anyway|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=November 5, 1976|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_o9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AAYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3698%2C1193697}}</ref>  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two [[water slide]]s and a [[Go-kart|go-kart track]], and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\".<ref>https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt</ref> The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]]. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n\nUltimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nAction Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2014/02/07/there-was-nothing-in-the-world-like-action-park/|title=There was Nothing in the World Like Action park|website=Sometimes-Interesting|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized [[insurance]] company.<ref name=\"NJ Herald\">McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; [http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy Ultimate wine snob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234456/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy |date=December 22, 2007 }}; ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', retrieved August 27, 2006. </ref> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five [[insurance fraud]]-related charges.<ref name=\"state investigation\">New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given,  [http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/hist6.pdf#search=%22%22Eugene%20Mulvihill%22%22 ''Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money''], 47, retrieved August 27, 2006.</ref>  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper.\n\nThe park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant.

It allowed guests to compete against other guests in an obstacle course, and against park-employed \"Gladiators\" in jousting matches.  Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms.<ref name=\"news.google.com\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177&dq=action-park&hl=en|title='Action' fitting name for Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|author=Rice, Bill|date=July 26, 1992|work=The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)}}</ref>  Over the course of a day, there were 3 shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court.\n\n===Alpine slide===\n[[File:Action Park (2999307425).jpg|thumb|right|Chairlift to alpine slide.]]\nAction Park's {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's [[chairlift]]s, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake/accelerator control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The chutes the sleds traveled in were made of [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]], and [[asbestos]], which led to serious [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in [[bathing suit]]s made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and [[expectoration|spitting]] from passengers going up for their turn.<ref name=\"Gethard\">Gethard, Chris; October 2005, \"Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park,\" ''Weird NJ'', 23.</ref>\n\nThe slide led to the first fatality at the park, a [[head injury]] suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. [[Hay bale]]s at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 [[Bone fracture|fractures]] and 26 [[head injury|head injuries]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nWhen [[Intrawest]] reopened the water park as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark|Mountain Creek]] in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear [[helmet]]s and [[kneepad]]s. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's [[Labor Day]] was rainy and the slide had to be closed.\n\nThe chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the [[gondola lift|gondola]] that replaced the chairlift.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />  The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an [[alpine coaster]], which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.\n\n===Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride===\nIn 1991, Action Park opened up a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, two-station [[bungee jumping]] tower near the alpine slide.  The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19920726&id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177 |title='Action' Fitting Name For Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|work=The Daily Gazette |date=July 26, 1992}}</ref> Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.\n\n===Skateboard park===\nA [[skatepark]] briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' as saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\">Fergus, Tom; May 2006; \"Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts\", in [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"]; ''Weird NJ'', 29</ref>\n\n===Transmobile===\nThe Transmobile was a [[monorail]] that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff and riders who either did not understand or did not want to follow the rules.<ref>http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at-transmobile.html</ref>\n\nMuch of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's [[Miniature golf|mini golf]] course.<ref>http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm</ref>\n\n== Motorworld ==\nAction Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]], opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a [[condominium]] development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the [[Mountain Creek]] ski resort.\n=== Land rides ===\n* '''Super Go Karts''': The Super [[Go-kart|Go Karts]] allowed guests to drive around a small loop [[Race track|track]] at a speed of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, controlled by the [[governor (device)|governor devices]] on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging [[tennis ball]]s into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play [[bumper cars]] at {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}}, and many injuries resulted from [[head-on collision]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Also, the kart's engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by [[gasoline]] fumes as they drove.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n* '''LOLA Cars''': The LOLA Cars were miniature [[Open wheel car|open-cockpit race cars]] on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a [[microbrewery]] nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n* '''Battle Action Tanks''': Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a [[chainlink]] fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a [[sensor]] prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests,<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.\n\n=== Watercraft rides ===\n* '''Super Speedboats''': The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with [[snake]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> They could be driven around a small island at {{cvt|35|-|40|mph|km/h}}. While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant [[lifeguard]] after his boat [[capsize]]d following a collision.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Bumper Boats''': Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the [[engine]]s often leaked [[gasoline]], at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his [[skin]]. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n=== Air rides ===\n* '''Space Shot''': The Space Shot attraction was a tower [[Drop tower|drop ride]], common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under [[Mountain Creek]] management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the [[Six Flags]]-owned [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] theme park in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601897/|title=CATAPULTED INTO AMUSEMENT PARK HISTORY|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=July 24, 1998}}</ref>\n* '''Sling Shot''': Sling Shot was a [[Funtime (manufacturer)|bungee cord ride]] in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many [[Six Flags]] parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. \"We often wondered how many [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] cases came out of that ride\", one former employee recalled.<ref name=\"Jersey Ed\" />\n\n== Waterworld ==\n\nWater-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] count.  Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.\n\n=== Cannonball Loop ===\n[[File:Action Park looping water slide.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Cannonball Loop'', the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence.]]\nIn the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a [[Loop (roller coaster)|complete vertical loop]] at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Looping water slide picture\">See picture on [http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/cgi/forum1.cgi?read=153156 this discussion thread]</ref> The resulting slide, called the ''Cannonball Loop'', was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1985|fmt=eq}}) to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \"one of the idiots\" who took the offer, said, \"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\"<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n\nThe slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> One worker told a local newspaper that \"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in ''Weird NJ'', that some of the [[crash test dummy|test dummies]] sent down before it opened had been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[decapitation|decapitated]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nThe ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.\n\nThose who rode the ''Cannonball Loop'' have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.<ref name=\"Steve Braybrook\">Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"A Survivor from Action Park Writes In\"], in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\nFor the remainder of the park's existence, ''Cannonball Loop'' remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.\n\nIn 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the ''Cannonball Loop'' was unearthed and published online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rare-video-of-people-actually-riding-action-parks-infam-1563953390 |title=Rare Video Of People Actually Riding Action Park's Infamous Water Slide |author=Barry Petchesky |work=The Concourse |accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other notable water attractions ===\n[[File:Action Park (2999353205).jpg|thumb|right|Less buoyant chlorinated water made the wave pool harder to swim in than salt water in the ocean.]] \n* '''The Tidal Wave Pool''': The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor [[drowning|drowned]] in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the [[lifeguard]]s saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, \"The Grave Pool\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> It was {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|250|ft|m}} long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as {{convert|40|in|m}} in height.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not [[human swimming|swim]] when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a [[swimming pool|pool]] or [[lake]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the \"High Tide Wavepool\" but made the pool much shallower.\n* '''Aqua Skoot''': Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,<ref>http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement-rides-by-bailey</ref> riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was {{convert|30|ft}} long.<ref>http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides-water-slides-water-park/2</ref> The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.\n* '''Kamikaze''': This was the more \"tame\" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a \"chute\" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool. It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season.\n* '''The Kayak Experience''': It was an imitation [[whitewater]] course that used submerged electric [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to agitate the water above. Frequently the [[kayak]]s got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation. In 1982, a man died after trying to get back on his kayak and touching the wiring of the fans, sending him into cardiac arrest and leading to its permanent closure.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><!---- Former park employee Chris Ish says this was in Waterworld; if his account gets published, this will be included here. ----->\n[[File:Action Park (3000182624).jpg|thumb|right|Taking the Tarzan swing into a cold pool.]]\n* '''The Tarzan Swing''': This was a steel arch hanging from a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Wire rope|cable]] over a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> In 1984, one man died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after experiencing the swing.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Roaring Rapids''': This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured [[femur]]s, [[collar bone]]s and [[Human nose|noses]], and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] [[knee]]s and [[shoulder]]s. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride.\n* '''Surf Hill''': This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \"back breaker\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby [[snack bar]] with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost [[bikini]] tops, or both.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.\n* '''Super Speed Water Slides''': These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water\u2014which made a large splash\u2014and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Diving cliffs''': The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of [[grotto]], with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving [[cliff]]s\u2014one {{convert|23|ft|m}}, the other {{convert|18|ft|m}}\u2014above a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them\u2014or right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<ref name=\"Gethard\" /> Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" /> \n[[File:Action Park (2999338931).jpg|thumb|right|Carrying tubes up the mountain.]]\n* '''Colorado River Ride''': The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 2-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes. Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed. After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.\n** '''The Main Fork''': Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|-high}} jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.\n** '''The Alternative Forks''': Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,<ref>1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg</ref> and another fork. One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk</ref> Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY</ref> In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n: Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts. In the [[Mountain Creek]] era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to ''[[Weird NJ]]'' how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<ref name=\"Greg Shpunder\">Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; \"Action Park Designed to Hurt People\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.</ref> On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck \u2013 requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft \u2013 or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.<ref>More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc</ref> Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.\n\n===The Aerodium===\nThe Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.<ref>http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm</ref> Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the [[bodyflight]] instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of {{convert|6|or|7|ft|m}} above the ground, approximately {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n\n==Factors contributing to the park's safety record==\n\nA range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n\n===Ride design===\n\nAction Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long.  Ride designers may have had insufficient training in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. \"They seemed to build rides,\" one attendee recalled, \"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\"<ref name=\"Callan\">Callan, Matthew; November 22, 2000, [http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.php?id=235 In Memoriam: Action Park], ''Freezerbox''.</ref>\n\nGAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. For example, in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain [[liability insurance]].\n\n===Employees===\n\nThe vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were [[teenager]]s. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\">DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; \"From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\n\nMost were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Visitors===\n\nSince it was closer and slightly cheaper than [[Six Flags Great Adventure]], Action Park attracted many visitors from [[Urban area|urban]] enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\nThe staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSince many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of [[profanity|foul language]] (not always planned) and [[exhibitionism]] as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.<ref name=\"Gethard\" />\n\n=== Availability of alcohol on grounds ===\n\nThe park also sold beer in many [[kiosk]]s on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\n===Lax regulatory climate===\n\nDespite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was [[fine (penalty)|fined]] only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses\u2014except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSome of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n==Fatalities==\n{{main article|Incidents at independent amusement parks}}\nSix people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:\n* July 8, 1980: A 19-year-old park employee was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\">{{cite web|title=Water Ride Fatalities 1972\u20131997|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|website=rideaccidents.com|accessdate=September 6, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228054418/http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|archivedate=February 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Brooklyn Man Drowns in Pool At a Jersey Amusement Park |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DE1038F934A1575BC0A962948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAmusement%20and%20Theme%20Parks |accessdate=2006-08-26 |date=August 27, 1984}}</ref>\n* August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live [[wire|wiring]] for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed, and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]]. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby [[Warwick (village), New York|Warwick, New York]], where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /> The park at first disputed that the [[electric current]] caused his death, saying there were no [[burn (injury)|burns]] on his body, but the [[coroner]] responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based [[electrocution]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was \"just a nick\", while others argued it was closer to {{convert|8|in|cm}}. The state's [[New Jersey Department of Labor|Labor Department]] found that the fan was properly maintained and installed, and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /> The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* 1984 (Date Unknown): A fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the Tarzan Swing.

In its later years, [[Tort|personal injury]] lawsuits led to the closure of increasing numbers of rides, and eventually the entire park closed, in 1996.\n\nOn February 9, 1998, resort developer [[Intrawest]] announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861</ref> The park received a massive overhaul, which included extensively renovating and repairing attractions, especially those deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, with some being removed entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|title=New Water Park At Vernon Valley Scheduled To Open June 15|website=actionpark.com|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html|archive-date=1998-04-25}}</ref>Afterwards, the park reopened as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|footer_align=center|perrow = 1|total_width=200\n| image1 = Action Park (3000196846).jpg | caption1 = Landing at the end of a waterslide\n| image2 = Action Park (3000201136).jpg | caption2 = Mini-slide built into the side of a mountain\n}}\nThe idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined [[Mountain Creek|Vernon Valley/Great Gorge]] ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a {{convert|2700|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[alpine slide]] down one of the steep ski trails.<ref>{{cite news|title=So What If There's No Snow, Go Sliding Down Hill Anyway|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=November 5, 1976|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_o9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AAYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3698%2C1193697}}</ref>  For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two [[water slide]]s and a [[Go-kart|go-kart track]], and named the collection of rides the \"Vernon Valley Summer Park\".<ref>https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt</ref> The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \"Action Park\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]]. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n\nUltimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nAction Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2014/02/07/there-was-nothing-in-the-world-like-action-park/|title=There was Nothing in the World Like Action park|website=Sometimes-Interesting|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref> Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized [[insurance]] company.<ref name=\"NJ Herald\">McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; [http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy Ultimate wine snob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234456/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NjkyNjgy |date=December 22, 2007 }}; ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', retrieved August 27, 2006. </ref> Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five [[insurance fraud]]-related charges.<ref name=\"state investigation\">New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given,  [http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/hist6.pdf#search=%22%22Eugene%20Mulvihill%22%22 ''Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money''], 47, retrieved August 27, 2006.</ref>  Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper.\n\nThe park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant.

Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake/accelerator control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \"death awaits\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> The chutes the sleds traveled in were made of [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]], and [[asbestos]], which led to serious [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in [[bathing suit]]s made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and [[expectoration|spitting]] from passengers going up for their turn.<ref name=\"Gethard\">Gethard, Chris; October 2005, \"Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park,\" ''Weird NJ'', 23.</ref>\n\nThe slide led to the first fatality at the park, a [[head injury]] suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him. [[Hay bale]]s at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 [[Bone fracture|fractures]] and 26 [[head injury|head injuries]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nWhen [[Intrawest]] reopened the water park as [[Mountain Creek Waterpark|Mountain Creek]] in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear [[helmet]]s and [[kneepad]]s. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's [[Labor Day]] was rainy and the slide had to be closed.\n\nThe chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the [[gondola lift|gondola]] that replaced the chairlift.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />  The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an [[alpine coaster]], which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster.\n\n===Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride===\nIn 1991, Action Park opened up a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, two-station [[bungee jumping]] tower near the alpine slide.  The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19920726&id=9N5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UukMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1147,6299177 |title='Action' Fitting Name For Northern New Jersey Amusement Park|work=The Daily Gazette |date=July 26, 1992}}</ref> Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996.\n\n===Skateboard park===\nA [[skatepark]] briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' as saying that the \"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\".<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\">Fergus, Tom; May 2006; \"Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts\", in [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"]; ''Weird NJ'', 29</ref>\n\n===Transmobile===\nThe Transmobile was a [[monorail]] that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff and riders who either did not understand or did not want to follow the rules.<ref>http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at-transmobile.html</ref>\n\nMuch of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's [[Miniature golf|mini golf]] course.<ref>http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm</ref>\n\n== Motorworld ==\nAction Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of [[New Jersey Route 94|Route 94]], opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a [[condominium]] development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the [[Mountain Creek]] ski resort.\n=== Land rides ===\n* '''Super Go Karts''': The Super [[Go-kart|Go Karts]] allowed guests to drive around a small loop [[Race track|track]] at a speed of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}, controlled by the [[governor (device)|governor devices]] on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging [[tennis ball]]s into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play [[bumper cars]] at {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}}, and many injuries resulted from [[head-on collision]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> Also, the kart's engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by [[gasoline]] fumes as they drove.<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/>\n* '''LOLA Cars''': The LOLA Cars were miniature [[Open wheel car|open-cockpit race cars]] on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a [[microbrewery]] nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n* '''Battle Action Tanks''': Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a [[chainlink]] fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a [[sensor]] prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests,<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.\n\n=== Watercraft rides ===\n* '''Super Speedboats''': The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with [[snake]]s.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> They could be driven around a small island at {{cvt|35|-|40|mph|km/h}}. While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant [[lifeguard]] after his boat [[capsize]]d following a collision.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Bumper Boats''': Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the [[engine]]s often leaked [[gasoline]], at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his [[skin]]. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n=== Air rides ===\n* '''Space Shot''': The Space Shot attraction was a tower [[Drop tower|drop ride]], common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under [[Mountain Creek]] management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the [[Six Flags]]-owned [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] theme park in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34601897/|title=CATAPULTED INTO AMUSEMENT PARK HISTORY|work=The Record|location=New Jersey|date=July 24, 1998}}</ref>\n* '''Sling Shot''': Sling Shot was a [[Funtime (manufacturer)|bungee cord ride]] in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many [[Six Flags]] parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. \"We often wondered how many [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] cases came out of that ride\", one former employee recalled.<ref name=\"Jersey Ed\" />\n\n== Waterworld ==\n\nWater-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] count.  Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions.\n\n=== Cannonball Loop ===\n[[File:Action Park looping water slide.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Cannonball Loop'', the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence.]]\nIn the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a [[Loop (roller coaster)|complete vertical loop]] at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Looping water slide picture\">See picture on [http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/cgi/forum1.cgi?read=153156 this discussion thread]</ref> The resulting slide, called the ''Cannonball Loop'', was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1985|fmt=eq}}) to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \"one of the idiots\" who took the offer, said, \"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\"<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" />\n\nThe slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> One worker told a local newspaper that \"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in ''Weird NJ'', that some of the [[crash test dummy|test dummies]] sent down before it opened had been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and [[decapitation|decapitated]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nThe ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown.\n\nThose who rode the ''Cannonball Loop'' have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.<ref name=\"Steve Braybrook\">Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; [http://weirdnj.com/stories/action-park/ \"A Survivor from Action Park Writes In\"], in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\nFor the remainder of the park's existence, ''Cannonball Loop'' remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed.\n\nIn 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the ''Cannonball Loop'' was unearthed and published online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rare-video-of-people-actually-riding-action-parks-infam-1563953390 |title=Rare Video Of People Actually Riding Action Park's Infamous Water Slide |author=Barry Petchesky |work=The Concourse |accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other notable water attractions ===\n[[File:Action Park (2999353205).jpg|thumb|right|Less buoyant chlorinated water made the wave pool harder to swim in than salt water in the ocean.]] \n* '''The Tidal Wave Pool''': The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor [[drowning|drowned]] in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the [[lifeguard]]s saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, \"The Grave Pool\".<ref name=\"Traction Park\"/> It was {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|250|ft|m}} long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as {{convert|40|in|m}} in height.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not [[human swimming|swim]] when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a [[swimming pool|pool]] or [[lake]].<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the \"High Tide Wavepool\" but made the pool much shallower.\n* '''Aqua Skoot''': Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,<ref>http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement-rides-by-bailey</ref> riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was {{convert|30|ft}} long.<ref>http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides-water-slides-water-park/2</ref> The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.\n* '''Kamikaze''': This was the more \"tame\" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a \"chute\" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool. It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season.\n* '''The Kayak Experience''': It was an imitation [[whitewater]] course that used submerged electric [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to agitate the water above. Frequently the [[kayak]]s got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation. In 1982, a man died after trying to get back on his kayak and touching the wiring of the fans, sending him into cardiac arrest and leading to its permanent closure.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><!---- Former park employee Chris Ish says this was in Waterworld; if his account gets published, this will be included here. ----->\n[[File:Action Park (3000182624).jpg|thumb|right|Taking the Tarzan swing into a cold pool.]]\n* '''The Tarzan Swing''': This was a steel arch hanging from a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Wire rope|cable]] over a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> In 1984, one man died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after experiencing the swing.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Roaring Rapids''': This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured [[femur]]s, [[collar bone]]s and [[Human nose|noses]], and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] [[knee]]s and [[shoulder]]s. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride.\n* '''Surf Hill''': This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \"back breaker\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby [[snack bar]] with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost [[bikini]] tops, or both.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /> Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.\n* '''Super Speed Water Slides''': These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water\u2014which made a large splash\u2014and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n* '''Diving cliffs''': The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of [[grotto]], with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving [[cliff]]s\u2014one {{convert|23|ft|m}}, the other {{convert|18|ft|m}}\u2014above a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them\u2014or right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions.<ref name=\"Gethard\" /> Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes.<ref name=\"Tom Fergus\" /> \n[[File:Action Park (2999338931).jpg|thumb|right|Carrying tubes up the mountain.]]\n* '''Colorado River Ride''': The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 2-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes. Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed. After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork.\n** '''The Main Fork''': Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|-high}} jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface.\n** '''The Alternative Forks''': Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,<ref>1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg</ref> and another fork. One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk</ref> Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY</ref> In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n: Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts. In the [[Mountain Creek]] era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to ''[[Weird NJ]]'' how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.<ref name=\"Greg Shpunder\">Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; \"Action Park Designed to Hurt People\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 28.</ref> On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck \u2013 requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft \u2013 or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.<ref>More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc</ref> Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.\n\n===The Aerodium===\nThe Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.<ref>http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm</ref> Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the [[bodyflight]] instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of {{convert|6|or|7|ft|m}} above the ground, approximately {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.\n\n==Factors contributing to the park's safety record==\n\nA range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight.\n\n===Ride design===\n\nAction Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long.  Ride designers may have had insufficient training in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. \"They seemed to build rides,\" one attendee recalled, \"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\"<ref name=\"Callan\">Callan, Matthew; November 22, 2000, [http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.php?id=235 In Memoriam: Action Park], ''Freezerbox''.</ref>\n\nGAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. For example, in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain [[liability insurance]].\n\n===Employees===\n\nThe vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were [[teenager]]s. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\">DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; \"From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager\" in \"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.</ref>\n\nMost were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Visitors===\n\nSince it was closer and slightly cheaper than [[Six Flags Great Adventure]], Action Park attracted many visitors from [[Urban area|urban]] enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language.<ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\nThe staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSince many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of [[profanity|foul language]] (not always planned) and [[exhibitionism]] as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them.<ref name=\"Gethard\" />\n\n=== Availability of alcohol on grounds ===\n\nThe park also sold beer in many [[kiosk]]s on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" /><ref name=\"Jim DeSaye\" />\n\n===Lax regulatory climate===\n\nDespite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the ''[[New Jersey Herald]]'', Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was [[fine (penalty)|fined]] only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses\u2014except Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\nSome of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.<ref name=\"Traction Park\" />\n\n==Fatalities==\n{{main article|Incidents at independent amusement parks}}\nSix people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park:\n* July 8, 1980: A 19-year-old park employee was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\">{{cite web|title=Water Ride Fatalities 1972\u20131997|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|website=rideaccidents.com|accessdate=September 6, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228054418/http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html|archivedate=February 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.<ref name=\"Water Ride Accidents\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Brooklyn Man Drowns in Pool At a Jersey Amusement Park |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DE1038F934A1575BC0A962948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAmusement%20and%20Theme%20Parks |accessdate=2006-08-26 |date=August 27, 1984}}</ref>\n* August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the Kayak Experience to right it.

''F.s. silvestris'' which is the European wildcat, has a tendency to be very timid and aggressive even when they are raised starting as kittens around a human population. This group was also very territorial and showed aggressive behavior within their own species as well.

Most of which are single gene traits found at low to moderate levels in the non pedigree cat. This means that this characteristic is rare and not seen in the common everyday house cat. Unlike most dogs found today who come from a mixture of purebreed lineages, cats started as a mixture of many wildcat variations and have been selectively bred by humans for certain traits which lead to modern breeds. This is the reason for the massive jump in the number of breeds in such a short number of years. This is also the reason why the associations who classify these breeds use the word  \u201cpedigreed\u201d instead of \u201cpurebred\u201d because no cat is actually purebred.<ref name=\":3\" /> DNA studies have been conducted to connect the pedigree lines to their random bred ancestors. These studies were conducted using the same techniques as mentioned above for finding the common ancestor which were the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. All cat breeds were found to have originated in eight different regions and then selectively bred multiple times throughout history and relocated multiple times leading to the approximately 45 modern breeds.

Most of which are single gene traits found at low to moderate levels in the non pedigree cat. This means that this characteristic is rare and not seen in the common everyday house cat. Unlike most dogs found today who come from a mixture of purebreed lineages, cats started as a mixture of many wildcat variations and have been selectively bred by humans for certain traits which lead to modern breeds. This is the reason for the massive jump in the number of breeds in such a short number of years.

They were used extensively from the late 18th to the early 20th century in the [[Cotton mill|mills]] of [[Lancashire]] and elsewhere. Mules were worked in pairs by a minder, with the help of two boys: the little piecer and the big or side piecer. The carriage carried up to 1,320 spindles and could be {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, and would move forward and back a distance of {{convert|5|ft|m}} four times a minute.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=11}}</ref>\nIt was invented between 1775 and 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]]. The self-acting (automatic) mule was patented by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] in 1825. At its peak there were 50,000,000 mule spindles in Lancashire alone. Modern versions are still in niche production and are used to spin [[woollen]] yarns from noble fibres such as [[cashmere wool|cashmere]], ultra-fine merino and [[alpaca]] for the knitware market. {{r|Bigagli}}{{r|Cormatex}}\n\nThe spinning mule spins textile fibres into [[yarn]] by an intermittent process.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=109}}</ref> In the draw stroke, the [[roving]] is pulled through rollers and twisted; on the return it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the [[throstle frame]] or [[Ring spinning|ring frame]] uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles,<ref>{{harvnb|Nasmith|1895|p=109}}</ref> which would operate 4 times a minute for 56 hours a week.\n\n==History==\nBefore the 1770s, textile production was a [[cottage industry]] using [[flax]] and [[wool]]. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would [[Carding|card]] the fibre \u2014 break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough [[roving]]s into [[yarn]] wound on a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. The male weaver would use a frame [[loom]] to weave this into cloth. This was then [[Tenterhook|tentered]] in the sun to bleach it. The invention by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] of the [[flying shuttle]] made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.\n\nThere were two types of spinning wheel: the [[Spinning wheel|Simple Wheel]], which uses an '''intermittent''' process, and the more refined Saxony wheel, which drives a differential [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and flyer with a heck (an apparatus that guides the thread to the reels) in a '''continuous''' process. These two wheels became the starting point of technological development. Businessmen such as [[Richard Arkwright]] employed inventors to find solutions that would increase the amount of yarn spun, then took out the relevant patents. \n\nThe [[spinning jenny]] allowed a group of eight spindles to be operated together. It mirrored the simple wheel; the rovings were clamped, and a frame moved forward stretching and thinning the roving. A wheel was rapidly turned as the frame was pushed back, and the spindles rotated, twisting the rovings into yarn and collecting it on the spindles. The spinning jenny was effective and could be operated by hand, but it produced weaker thread that could only be used for the weft part of cloth. (Because the side-to-side [[weft]] does not have to be stretched on a loom in the way that the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] is, it can generally be less strong.)\n\nThe throstle and the later [[water frame]] pulled the rovings through a set of attenuating rollers. Spinning at differing speeds, these pulled the thread continuously while other parts twisted it as it wound onto the heavy spindles. This produced thread suitable for warp, but the multiple rollers required much more energy input and demanded that the device be driven by a water wheel. The early water frame, however, had only a single spindle. Combining ideas from these two system inspired the '''spinning mule'''.\n\nThe increased supply of muslin inspired developments in loom design such as [[Edmund Cartwright]]'s [[power loom]]. Some spinners and [[Loom|handloom weavers]] opposed the perceived threat to their livelihood: there were frame-breaking riots and, in 1811\u201313, the [[Luddite]] riots. The preparatory and associated tasks allowed many [[Child labour|children to be employed]] until this was regulated.\n\nThe hand-operated mule was a breakthrough in yarn production and the machines were copied by [[Samuel Slater]], who founded the cotton industry in [[Rhode Island]]. Development over the next century and a half led to an automatic mule and to finer and stronger yarn. The [[ring spinning|ring frame]], originating in [[New England]] in the 1820s, was little used in Lancashire until the 1890s. It required more energy and could not produce the finest counts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saxonhouse|first=Gary|last2=Wright|first2=Gavin|chapter=Technological Evolution in Cotton Spinning, 1878\u20131933|title=The Japanese Economy in Retrospect|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHUagf2C8YsC&pg=PA323#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=World Scientific|date=2010}}</ref>\n\n===The first mule===\n[[File:Baines 1835-Mule Jenny.png|thumb|An early spinning mule: showing the gearing in the headstock]]\n[[Samuel Crompton]] invented the '''spinning mule''' in 1779, so called because it is a hybrid of Arkwright's [[Water Frame|water frame]] and [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]] in the same way that [[mule]] is the product of crossbreeding a [[mare|female horse]] with a [[donkey|male donkey]] (a female donkey is called a ''jenny''). The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical [[bobbin]]s to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.\n\nCrompton built his mule from wood. Although he used Hargreaves' ideas of spinning multiple threads and of attenuating the roving with rollers, it was he who put the spindles on the carriage and fixed a creel of roving bobbins on the frame. Both the rollers and the outward motion of the carriage remove irregularities from the rove before it is wound on the spindle. When Arkwright's patents expired, the mule was developed by several manufacturers.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 219\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=219}}</ref>\nCrompton's first mule had 48 spindles and could produce {{convert|1|lb|kg}} of 60s thread a day. This demanded a spindle speed of 1,700&nbsp;rpm, and a power input of {{convert|1/16|hp|W}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe mule produced strong, thin [[yarn]], suitable for any kind of [[textile]], warp or weft. It was first used to spin cotton, then other fibres.\n\nSamuel Crompton could not afford to [[patent]] his invention. He sold the rights to [[David Dale]] and returned to weaving. Dale patented the mule and profited from it.\n\n===Improvements===\nCrompton's machine was largely built of wood, using bands and pulley for the driving motions. After his machine was public, he had little to do with its development. Henry Stones, a mechanic from [[Horwich]], constructed a mule using toothed gearing and, importantly, metal rollers.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 219\"/> Baker of Bury worked on drums,<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 221\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=221}}</ref> and Hargreaves used parallel scrolling to achieve smoother acceleration and deceleration.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 222\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn 1790, William Kelly of [[Glasgow]] used a new method to assist the draw stroke.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 222\"/> First animals, and then water, was used as the prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, allowing twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=223}}</ref> He was in conversation with John Kennedy about the possibility of a self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in [[Ancoats]], was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules;<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=43}}</ref> their firm prospered and eventually merged into the [[Fine Spinners and Doublers|Fine Spinners & Doublers Association]]. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=224}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Eaton, in 1818, improved the winding of the thread by using two faller wires and performing a backing off at the end of the outward traverse.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=226}}</ref> All these mules had been worked by the strength of the operatives. The next improvement was a fully automatic mule.\n\n===Roberts' self-acting mule===\n[[File:Baines 1835-Roberts' Self Acting Mule.png|thumb|A [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Roberts]] self-acting spinning mule: 1835 diagram showing the gearing in the headstock]]\n\n[[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] took out his first patent in 1825 and a second in 1830. The task he had set himself was to design a self-actor, a self-acting or automatic spinning mule. Roberts is also known for the [[Roberts Loom]], which was widely adopted because of its reliability. The mule in 1820 still needed manual assistance to spin a consistent thread; a self-acting mule would need:\n* A reversing mechanism that would unwind a spiral of yarn on the top of each spindle, before commencing the winding of a new stretch\n* A faller wire that would ensure the yarn was wound into a predefined form such as a cop\n* An appliance to vary the speed of revolution of the spindle, in accordance with the diameter of thread on that spindle\nA counter faller under the thread was made to rise to take in the slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were controlled by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|pp=226\u2013230}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Selfactor01.jpg|A cross section 1882\nFile:Selfaktor ausgefahren.jpg|The outward traverse\nFile:Selfaktor eingefahren.jpg|The inward traverse\nFile:Textile-Spinning room.jpg|Notice the faller wire gear\nFile:Vonwiller 001.jpg|Selfactor in Vonwiller & Co., [[\u017damberk]], [[Austro-Hungaria]]\n</gallery>\n\nWith the invention of the self actor, the hand-operated mule was increasingly referred to as a mule-jenny.<ref name=c51>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=51}}</ref>\n\n===Oldham counts===\nOldham counts refers to the medium thickness cotton that was used for general purpose cloth. Roberts didn't profit from his self-acting spinning mule, but on the expiry of the patent other firms took forward the development, and the mule was adapted for the counts it spun. Initially Robert's self-actor was used for coarse counts (Oldham Counts), but the mule-jenny continued to be used for the very finest counts (Bolton counts) until the 1890s and beyond.<ref name=c51/>\n\n===Bolton counts===\nBolton specialised in fine count cotton, and its mules ran more slowly to put in the extra twist. The mule jenny allowed for this gentler action but in the 20th century additional mechanisms were added to make the motion more gentle, leading to mules that used two or even three driving speeds. Fine counts needed a softer action on the winding, and relied on manual adjustment to wind the chase or top of the perfect cop.<ref name=c75-9>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|pp=75\u20139,118}}</ref>\n\n===Woollen mules===\nSpinning wool is a different process as the variable lengths of the individual fibres means that they are unsuitable for attenuation be roller drafting. For this reason, woolen fibres are carded using condenser cards which rub the carded fibres together rather than drafting them. They are then spun on mule-type machines which have no roller drafting, but create the draft by the spindles receding from the delvery rollers whilst that latter, having paid out a short length of roving, are held stationary. Such mules are often complex involving multiple spindles speeds, receding motions, etc. to ensure optimum treatment of the yarn. <ref name=c141>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|pp=141\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Condenser spinning===\n[[File:Masson Mills WTM 14 mules 5957.JPG|thumb|]] A pair of Condenser spinning mules. These have 748 spindles and are believed to be the longest surviving cotton mules. They worked at Field Mill Ramsbottom, Lancashire until that mill closed in 1988 at which time they were the last such machines at work in the cotton industry probably in the world. These mules were built by Asa Lees and Company Ltd, of Oldham in 1906.\nCondenser spinning was developed to enable the short fibres produced as waste from the combing of fine cottons, to be spun into a soft, coarse yarns suitable for sheeting, blankets etc.  Only approximately 2% of the mule spindles in Lancashire were Condenser spindles, but many more Condenser mules survive today as these were the last spindles regularly at work., and the mules are similar.<ref name=c144>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=144}}</ref> [[Helmshore Mills Textile Museum|Helmshore Mills]] was a cotton waste mule spinning mill.\n\n===Current usage===\nMules are still in use for spinning woolen and alpaca, and being produced across the world.

On the return trip, known as putting up,<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|Wild|Little|2007|p=166}}</ref> as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn is wound onto the spindle in the form of a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.\n\nMarsden in 1885 described the processes of setting up and operating a mule. Here is his description, edited slightly.\n\nThe [[Creel (textiles)|creel]] holds bobbins containing [[roving]]s. The rovings are\npassed through small guide-wires, and between the three pairs of drawing-rollers.\n* The first pair takes hold of the roving, to draw the roving or sliver from the bobbin, and deliver it to the next pair.\n* The motion of the middle pair is slightly quicker than the first, but only sufficiently so to keep the roving uniformly tense\n* The front pair, running much more quickly, draws out (attenuates) the roving so it is equal throughout.\n\nConnection is then established between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When the latter are bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These are attached to the threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.\n\nThe back rollers pull the sliver from the bobbins, and passing it to the succeeding pairs, whose differential speeds attenuate it to the required degree of fineness. As it is delivered in front, the spindles, revolving at a rate of 6,000\u20139,000&nbsp;rpm twist the hitherto loose fibres together, thus forming a thread.\n\nWhilst this is going on, the spindle carriage is being drawn away from the rollers, at a pace very slightly exceeding the rate at which the roving is coming forth. This is called the ''' gain''' of the carriage, its purpose being to eliminate all irregularities in the fineness of the thread. Should a thick place in the roving come through the rollers, it would resist the efforts of the spindle to twist it; and, if passed in this condition, it would seriously deteriorate the quality of the yarn, and impede subsequent operations. As, however, the twist, spreading itself over the level thread, gives firmness to this portion, the thick and untwisted part yields to the draught of the spindle, and, as it approaches the tenuity of the remainder, it receives the twist it had hitherto refused to take. The carriage, which is borne upon wheels, continues its outward progress, until it reaches the extremity of its traverse, which is {{convert|63|in|cm}} from the roller beam. The revolution of the spindles cease, the drawing rollers stop.\n\nBacking-off commences. This process is the unwinding of the several turns of the yarn, extending from the top of the cop in process of formation to the summit of the spindle. As this proceeds, the faller- wire, which is placed over and guides the threads upon the cop, is depressed ; the counter-faller at the same time rising, the slack unwound from the spindles is taken up, and the threads are prevented from running into snarls. Backing-off is completed.\n\nThe carriage commences to run inwards; that is, towards the rollerbeam. This is called putting up. The spindles wind on the yarn at a uniform rate. The speed of revolution of the spindle must vary, as the faller is guiding the thread upon the larger or smaller\ndiameter of the cone of the cop. Immediately the winding is finished, the depressed faller rises, the counter-faller is put down.\n\nThese movements are repeated until the cops on each spindle are perfectly formed: the '''' set''' is completed. A stop-motion paralyzes every action of the machine, rendering it necessary to '''doff''' or strip the spindles, and to commence anew.\n\nDoffing is performed by the piercers thrutching, that is raising, the cops partially up the spindles, whilst the carriage is out. The minder then depressing the faller, so far as to guide the threads upon the bare spindle below. A few turns are wound onto the spindle, to fix the threads to the bare spindles for a new set. The cops are removed and collected into cans or baskets, and subsequently delivered to the warehouse. The remainder of the \"draw\" or \"stretch,\" as the length of spun yarn is called when the carriage is out, is then wound upon the spindles as the carriage is run up to the roller beam. Work then commences anew. <!-- This text is heavily derived from Marsdens 1885 book which is out of copyright--><ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|pp=240\u2013242}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=157}}</ref>\nThe doffing took only a few minutes, the piecers would run the length of the mule gate thrutching five spindles a time, and the doffing involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the minder would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the minder would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the faller wire several times. Alternatively, a starch paste could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers \u2013 and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle \u2013 this slowed down the doffing operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=158}}</ref>\n\n===Duties of the operatives===\nA pair of mules would be manned by a person called the minder and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the minder and the little piecer worked the minder half of the mule. The minder would make minor adjustments to his mules to the extent that each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the gaffer and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it the quantity and quality of the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of rovings came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in indelible pencil.\n[[File:Mule-spinning room in Chace Cotton Mill. Raoul Julien a \"back-roping boy.\" Has been here 2 years. Burlington, Vt. - NARA - 523189.jpg|thumb|Mule-spinning room]]\nCreeling involved replacing the rovings bobbins in a section of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30&nbsp;cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=154}}</ref>\n\nPiecing involved repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, the broken yarn would be caught on the underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle might have to be stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent on the quality of the roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=155}}</ref>\n\nDoffing has already been described.\n\nCleaning was important and until a formal ritual had been devised it was a dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and in the region of the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the {{convert|1+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The piecers would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage spindle rail and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double the entire length of the mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would unclip the stang and start the mule. Before this ritual was devised, boys had been crushed. The mule was {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, the minder's eyesight might not have been good, the air in the mill was clouded with fly and another minder's boys might have been mistaken for his.

Both industries underwent a great expansion at about the same time, which can be used to identify the start of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe 1790 mule was operated by brute force: the spinner drawing and pushing the frame while attending to each spindle. Home spinning was the occupation of women and girls, but the strength needed to operate a mule caused it to be the activity of men. Hand loom weaving, however, had been a man's occupation but in the mill it could and was done by girls and women. Spinners were the bare-foot aristocrats of the factory system.<ref name=\"Fowler\">{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Alan|date=11\u201313 Nov 2004|title=British Textile Workers in the Lancashire Cotton and Yorkshire Wool Industries|journal=National overview Great Britain, Textile conference IISH}}</ref> It replaced decentralized [[putting-out system|cottage industries]] with centralized factory jobs, driving economic upheaval and [[urbanization]].\n\nMule spinners were the leaders in unionism within the cotton industry; the pressure to develop the self-actor or self-acting mule was partly to open the trade to women. It was in 1870 that the first national [[labor union|union]] was formed.\n\nThe wool industry was divided into [[woollen]] and [[worsted]]. It lagged behind cotton in adopting new technology. Worsted tended to adopt Arkwright water frames which could be operated by young girls, and woollen adopted the mule.<ref name=\"Fowler\"/>\n\n==Mule-spinners' cancer==\n{{main|Mule spinners' cancer}}\nAbout 1900 there was a high incidence of [[cancer|scrotal cancer]] detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles, when running, threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=179}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cotton mill]]\n* [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Textile manufacturing]]\n* [[Timeline of clothing and textiles technology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Catling|first=Harold|title=The Spinning Mule|publisher=The Lancashire Library|location=Preston|year=1986|isbn=0-902228-61-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nasmith|first=Joseph|author-link=Joseph Nasmith|title=Recent Cotton Mill Construction and Engineering|publisher=John Heywood|location=London|year=1895|edition=Elibron Classics|isbn=1-4021-4558-6|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Marsden|first=Richard|title=Cotton Spinning: its development, principles an practice.|publisher=George Bell and Sons 1903|year=1884|url=https://archive.org/details/cottonspinningit00mars|accessdate=2009-04-26|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|title=Cotton Yearbook 1910|editor=Marsden|publisher=Marsden and Co.|location=Manchester|year=1909|url=https://archive.org/stream/cottonyearbook1910manc|accessdate=2009-04-26|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Miller|first=I |last2=Wild |first2=C |last3=Little |first3=S |title=A & G Murray and the Cotton Mills of Ancoats|publisher=Oxford Archaeology North|location=Storey Institute Lancaster|year=2007|ref=harv|isbn=0-904220-46-X}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mule spinning}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwlhYBJ24M0 Short video showing the spinning of cotton yarn on a self-acting cotton mule.

They were used extensively from the late 18th to the early 20th century in the [[Cotton mill|mills]] of [[Lancashire]] and elsewhere. Mules were worked in pairs by a minder, with the help of two boys: the little piecer and the big or side piecer. The carriage carried up to 1,320 spindles and could be {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, and would move forward and back a distance of {{convert|5|ft|m}} four times a minute.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=11}}</ref>\nIt was invented between 1775 and 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]]. The self-acting (automatic) mule was patented by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] in 1825. At its peak there were 50,000,000 mule spindles in Lancashire alone. Modern versions are still in niche production and are used to spin [[woollen]] yarns from noble fibres such as [[cashmere wool|cashmere]], ultra-fine merino and [[alpaca]] for the knitware market. {{r|Bigagli}}{{r|Cormatex}}\n\nThe spinning mule spins textile fibres into [[yarn]] by an intermittent process.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=109}}</ref> In the draw stroke, the [[roving]] is pulled through rollers and twisted; on the return it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the [[throstle frame]] or [[Ring spinning|ring frame]] uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles,<ref>{{harvnb|Nasmith|1895|p=109}}</ref> which would operate 4 times a minute for 56 hours a week.\n\n==History==\nBefore the 1770s, textile production was a [[cottage industry]] using [[flax]] and [[wool]]. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would [[Carding|card]] the fibre \u2014 break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough [[roving]]s into [[yarn]] wound on a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. The male weaver would use a frame [[loom]] to weave this into cloth. This was then [[Tenterhook|tentered]] in the sun to bleach it. The invention by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] of the [[flying shuttle]] made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.\n\nThere were two types of spinning wheel: the [[Spinning wheel|Simple Wheel]], which uses an '''intermittent''' process, and the more refined Saxony wheel, which drives a differential [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and flyer with a heck (an apparatus that guides the thread to the reels) in a '''continuous''' process. These two wheels became the starting point of technological development. Businessmen such as [[Richard Arkwright]] employed inventors to find solutions that would increase the amount of yarn spun, then took out the relevant patents. \n\nThe [[spinning jenny]] allowed a group of eight spindles to be operated together. It mirrored the simple wheel; the rovings were clamped, and a frame moved forward stretching and thinning the roving. A wheel was rapidly turned as the frame was pushed back, and the spindles rotated, twisting the rovings into yarn and collecting it on the spindles. The spinning jenny was effective and could be operated by hand, but it produced weaker thread that could only be used for the weft part of cloth. (Because the side-to-side [[weft]] does not have to be stretched on a loom in the way that the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] is, it can generally be less strong.)\n\nThe throstle and the later [[water frame]] pulled the rovings through a set of attenuating rollers. Spinning at differing speeds, these pulled the thread continuously while other parts twisted it as it wound onto the heavy spindles. This produced thread suitable for warp, but the multiple rollers required much more energy input and demanded that the device be driven by a water wheel. The early water frame, however, had only a single spindle. Combining ideas from these two system inspired the '''spinning mule'''.\n\nThe increased supply of muslin inspired developments in loom design such as [[Edmund Cartwright]]'s [[power loom]]. Some spinners and [[Loom|handloom weavers]] opposed the perceived threat to their livelihood: there were frame-breaking riots and, in 1811\u201313, the [[Luddite]] riots. The preparatory and associated tasks allowed many [[Child labour|children to be employed]] until this was regulated.\n\nThe hand-operated mule was a breakthrough in yarn production and the machines were copied by [[Samuel Slater]], who founded the cotton industry in [[Rhode Island]]. Development over the next century and a half led to an automatic mule and to finer and stronger yarn. The [[ring spinning|ring frame]], originating in [[New England]] in the 1820s, was little used in Lancashire until the 1890s. It required more energy and could not produce the finest counts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saxonhouse|first=Gary|last2=Wright|first2=Gavin|chapter=Technological Evolution in Cotton Spinning, 1878\u20131933|title=The Japanese Economy in Retrospect|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHUagf2C8YsC&pg=PA323#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=World Scientific|date=2010}}</ref>\n\n===The first mule===\n[[File:Baines 1835-Mule Jenny.png|thumb|An early spinning mule: showing the gearing in the headstock]]\n[[Samuel Crompton]] invented the '''spinning mule''' in 1779, so called because it is a hybrid of Arkwright's [[Water Frame|water frame]] and [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]] in the same way that [[mule]] is the product of crossbreeding a [[mare|female horse]] with a [[donkey|male donkey]] (a female donkey is called a ''jenny''). The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical [[bobbin]]s to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.\n\nCrompton built his mule from wood. Although he used Hargreaves' ideas of spinning multiple threads and of attenuating the roving with rollers, it was he who put the spindles on the carriage and fixed a creel of roving bobbins on the frame. Both the rollers and the outward motion of the carriage remove irregularities from the rove before it is wound on the spindle. When Arkwright's patents expired, the mule was developed by several manufacturers.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 219\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=219}}</ref>\nCrompton's first mule had 48 spindles and could produce {{convert|1|lb|kg}} of 60s thread a day. This demanded a spindle speed of 1,700&nbsp;rpm, and a power input of {{convert|1/16|hp|W}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe mule produced strong, thin [[yarn]], suitable for any kind of [[textile]], warp or weft. It was first used to spin cotton, then other fibres.\n\nSamuel Crompton could not afford to [[patent]] his invention. He sold the rights to [[David Dale]] and returned to weaving. Dale patented the mule and profited from it.\n\n===Improvements===\nCrompton's machine was largely built of wood, using bands and pulley for the driving motions. After his machine was public, he had little to do with its development. Henry Stones, a mechanic from [[Horwich]], constructed a mule using toothed gearing and, importantly, metal rollers.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 219\"/> Baker of Bury worked on drums,<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 221\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=221}}</ref> and Hargreaves used parallel scrolling to achieve smoother acceleration and deceleration.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 222\">{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn 1790, William Kelly of [[Glasgow]] used a new method to assist the draw stroke.<ref name=\"Marsden 1884 222\"/> First animals, and then water, was used as the prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, allowing twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=223}}</ref> He was in conversation with John Kennedy about the possibility of a self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in [[Ancoats]], was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules;<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=43}}</ref> their firm prospered and eventually merged into the [[Fine Spinners and Doublers|Fine Spinners & Doublers Association]]. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=224}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Eaton, in 1818, improved the winding of the thread by using two faller wires and performing a backing off at the end of the outward traverse.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|p=226}}</ref> All these mules had been worked by the strength of the operatives. The next improvement was a fully automatic mule.\n\n===Roberts' self-acting mule===\n[[File:Baines 1835-Roberts' Self Acting Mule.png|thumb|A [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Roberts]] self-acting spinning mule: 1835 diagram showing the gearing in the headstock]]\n\n[[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] took out his first patent in 1825 and a second in 1830. The task he had set himself was to design a self-actor, a self-acting or automatic spinning mule. Roberts is also known for the [[Roberts Loom]], which was widely adopted because of its reliability. The mule in 1820 still needed manual assistance to spin a consistent thread; a self-acting mule would need:\n* A reversing mechanism that would unwind a spiral of yarn on the top of each spindle, before commencing the winding of a new stretch\n* A faller wire that would ensure the yarn was wound into a predefined form such as a cop\n* An appliance to vary the speed of revolution of the spindle, in accordance with the diameter of thread on that spindle\nA counter faller under the thread was made to rise to take in the slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were controlled by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|pp=226\u2013230}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Selfactor01.jpg|A cross section 1882\nFile:Selfaktor ausgefahren.jpg|The outward traverse\nFile:Selfaktor eingefahren.jpg|The inward traverse\nFile:Textile-Spinning room.jpg|Notice the faller wire gear\nFile:Vonwiller 001.jpg|Selfactor in Vonwiller & Co., [[\u017damberk]], [[Austro-Hungaria]]\n</gallery>\n\nWith the invention of the self actor, the hand-operated mule was increasingly referred to as a mule-jenny.<ref name=c51>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=51}}</ref>\n\n===Oldham counts===\nOldham counts refers to the medium thickness cotton that was used for general purpose cloth. Roberts didn't profit from his self-acting spinning mule, but on the expiry of the patent other firms took forward the development, and the mule was adapted for the counts it spun. Initially Robert's self-actor was used for coarse counts (Oldham Counts), but the mule-jenny continued to be used for the very finest counts (Bolton counts) until the 1890s and beyond.<ref name=c51/>\n\n===Bolton counts===\nBolton specialised in fine count cotton, and its mules ran more slowly to put in the extra twist. The mule jenny allowed for this gentler action but in the 20th century additional mechanisms were added to make the motion more gentle, leading to mules that used two or even three driving speeds. Fine counts needed a softer action on the winding, and relied on manual adjustment to wind the chase or top of the perfect cop.<ref name=c75-9>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|pp=75\u20139,118}}</ref>\n\n===Woollen mules===\nSpinning wool is a different process as the variable lengths of the individual fibres means that they are unsuitable for attenuation be roller drafting. For this reason, woolen fibres are carded using condenser cards which rub the carded fibres together rather than drafting them. They are then spun on mule-type machines which have no roller drafting, but create the draft by the spindles receding from the delvery rollers whilst that latter, having paid out a short length of roving, are held stationary. Such mules are often complex involving multiple spindles speeds, receding motions, etc. to ensure optimum treatment of the yarn. <ref name=c141>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|pp=141\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Condenser spinning===\n[[File:Masson Mills WTM 14 mules 5957.JPG|thumb|]] A pair of Condenser spinning mules. These have 748 spindles and are believed to be the longest surviving cotton mules. They worked at Field Mill Ramsbottom, Lancashire until that mill closed in 1988 at which time they were the last such machines at work in the cotton industry probably in the world. These mules were built by Asa Lees and Company Ltd, of Oldham in 1906.\nCondenser spinning was developed to enable the short fibres produced as waste from the combing of fine cottons, to be spun into a soft, coarse yarns suitable for sheeting, blankets etc.  Only approximately 2% of the mule spindles in Lancashire were Condenser spindles, but many more Condenser mules survive today as these were the last spindles regularly at work., and the mules are similar.<ref name=c144>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=144}}</ref> [[Helmshore Mills Textile Museum|Helmshore Mills]] was a cotton waste mule spinning mill.\n\n===Current usage===\nMules are still in use for spinning woolen and alpaca, and being produced across the world.

On the return trip, known as putting up,<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|Wild|Little|2007|p=166}}</ref> as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn is wound onto the spindle in the form of a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.\n\nMarsden in 1885 described the processes of setting up and operating a mule. Here is his description, edited slightly.\n\nThe [[Creel (textiles)|creel]] holds bobbins containing [[roving]]s. The rovings are\npassed through small guide-wires, and between the three pairs of drawing-rollers.\n* The first pair takes hold of the roving, to draw the roving or sliver from the bobbin, and deliver it to the next pair.\n* The motion of the middle pair is slightly quicker than the first, but only sufficiently so to keep the roving uniformly tense\n* The front pair, running much more quickly, draws out (attenuates) the roving so it is equal throughout.\n\nConnection is then established between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When the latter are bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These are attached to the threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.\n\nThe back rollers pull the sliver from the bobbins, and passing it to the succeeding pairs, whose differential speeds attenuate it to the required degree of fineness. As it is delivered in front, the spindles, revolving at a rate of 6,000\u20139,000&nbsp;rpm twist the hitherto loose fibres together, thus forming a thread.\n\nWhilst this is going on, the spindle carriage is being drawn away from the rollers, at a pace very slightly exceeding the rate at which the roving is coming forth. This is called the ''' gain''' of the carriage, its purpose being to eliminate all irregularities in the fineness of the thread. Should a thick place in the roving come through the rollers, it would resist the efforts of the spindle to twist it; and, if passed in this condition, it would seriously deteriorate the quality of the yarn, and impede subsequent operations. As, however, the twist, spreading itself over the level thread, gives firmness to this portion, the thick and untwisted part yields to the draught of the spindle, and, as it approaches the tenuity of the remainder, it receives the twist it had hitherto refused to take. The carriage, which is borne upon wheels, continues its outward progress, until it reaches the extremity of its traverse, which is {{convert|63|in|cm}} from the roller beam. The revolution of the spindles cease, the drawing rollers stop.\n\nBacking-off commences. This process is the unwinding of the several turns of the yarn, extending from the top of the cop in process of formation to the summit of the spindle. As this proceeds, the faller- wire, which is placed over and guides the threads upon the cop, is depressed ; the counter-faller at the same time rising, the slack unwound from the spindles is taken up, and the threads are prevented from running into snarls. Backing-off is completed.\n\nThe carriage commences to run inwards; that is, towards the rollerbeam. This is called putting up. The spindles wind on the yarn at a uniform rate. The speed of revolution of the spindle must vary, as the faller is guiding the thread upon the larger or smaller\ndiameter of the cone of the cop. Immediately the winding is finished, the depressed faller rises, the counter-faller is put down.\n\nThese movements are repeated until the cops on each spindle are perfectly formed: the '''' set''' is completed. A stop-motion paralyzes every action of the machine, rendering it necessary to '''doff''' or strip the spindles, and to commence anew.\n\nDoffing is performed by the piercers thrutching, that is raising, the cops partially up the spindles, whilst the carriage is out. The minder then depressing the faller, so far as to guide the threads upon the bare spindle below. A few turns are wound onto the spindle, to fix the threads to the bare spindles for a new set. The cops are removed and collected into cans or baskets, and subsequently delivered to the warehouse. The remainder of the \"draw\" or \"stretch,\" as the length of spun yarn is called when the carriage is out, is then wound upon the spindles as the carriage is run up to the roller beam. Work then commences anew. <!-- This text is heavily derived from Marsdens 1885 book which is out of copyright--><ref>{{harvnb|Marsden|1884|pp=240\u2013242}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=157}}</ref>\nThe doffing took only a few minutes, the piecers would run the length of the mule gate thrutching five spindles a time, and the doffing involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the minder would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the minder would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the faller wire several times. Alternatively, a starch paste could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers \u2013 and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle \u2013 this slowed down the doffing operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=158}}</ref>\n\n===Duties of the operatives===\nA pair of mules would be manned by a person called the minder and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the minder and the little piecer worked the minder half of the mule. The minder would make minor adjustments to his mules to the extent that each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the gaffer and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it the quantity and quality of the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of rovings came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in indelible pencil.\n[[File:Mule-spinning room in Chace Cotton Mill. Raoul Julien a \"back-roping boy.\" Has been here 2 years. Burlington, Vt. - NARA - 523189.jpg|thumb|Mule-spinning room]]\nCreeling involved replacing the rovings bobbins in a section of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30&nbsp;cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=154}}</ref>\n\nPiecing involved repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, the broken yarn would be caught on the underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle might have to be stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent on the quality of the roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=155}}</ref>\n\nDoffing has already been described.\n\nCleaning was important and until a formal ritual had been devised it was a dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and in the region of the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the {{convert|1+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The piecers would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage spindle rail and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double the entire length of the mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would unclip the stang and start the mule.

Cotton and [[iron]] were leading sectors in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Both industries underwent a great expansion at about the same time, which can be used to identify the start of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe 1790 mule was operated by brute force: the spinner drawing and pushing the frame while attending to each spindle. Home spinning was the occupation of women and girls, but the strength needed to operate a mule caused it to be the activity of men. Hand loom weaving, however, had been a man's occupation but in the mill it could and was done by girls and women. Spinners were the bare-foot aristocrats of the factory system.<ref name=\"Fowler\">{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Alan|date=11\u201313 Nov 2004|title=British Textile Workers in the Lancashire Cotton and Yorkshire Wool Industries|journal=National overview Great Britain, Textile conference IISH}}</ref> It replaced decentralized [[putting-out system|cottage industries]] with centralized factory jobs, driving economic upheaval and [[urbanization]].\n\nMule spinners were the leaders in unionism within the cotton industry; the pressure to develop the self-actor or self-acting mule was partly to open the trade to women. It was in 1870 that the first national [[labor union|union]] was formed.\n\nThe wool industry was divided into [[woollen]] and [[worsted]]. It lagged behind cotton in adopting new technology. Worsted tended to adopt Arkwright water frames which could be operated by young girls, and woollen adopted the mule.<ref name=\"Fowler\"/>\n\n==Mule-spinners' cancer==\n{{main|Mule spinners' cancer}}\nAbout 1900 there was a high incidence of [[cancer|scrotal cancer]] detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.<ref>{{Harvnb|Catling|1986|p=179}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cotton mill]]\n* [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Textile manufacturing]]\n* [[Timeline of clothing and textiles technology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Catling|first=Harold|title=The Spinning Mule|publisher=The Lancashire Library|location=Preston|year=1986|isbn=0-902228-61-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nasmith|first=Joseph|author-link=Joseph Nasmith|title=Recent Cotton Mill Construction and Engineering|publisher=John Heywood|location=London|year=1895|edition=Elibron Classics|isbn=1-4021-4558-6|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Marsden|first=Richard|title=Cotton Spinning: its development, principles an practice.|publisher=George Bell and Sons 1903|year=1884|url=https://archive.org/details/cottonspinningit00mars|accessdate=2009-04-26|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|title=Cotton Yearbook 1910|editor=Marsden|publisher=Marsden and Co.|location=Manchester|year=1909|url=https://archive.org/stream/cottonyearbook1910manc|accessdate=2009-04-26|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Miller|first=I |last2=Wild |first2=C |last3=Little |first3=S |title=A & G Murray and the Cotton Mills of Ancoats|publisher=Oxford Archaeology North|location=Storey Institute Lancaster|year=2007|ref=harv|isbn=0-904220-46-X}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mule spinning}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwlhYBJ24M0 Short video showing the spinning of cotton yarn on a self-acting cotton mule.

By the second season, they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age. In this season, Darren has his unwieldy [[orthodontic headgear]] that he has worn for the entire first season removed, which results in rising popularity. They graduate junior high in the middle of the third season and move on to becoming freshmen in high school. Carl's age group works in a same way, as they become junior high students by the third season. Many episodes make references to past episodes, giving the episodes a definite order.\n\nOne of the most noticeable developments is that the characters change clothes every episode and often newer every day within the same episode, a highly unusual characteristic of cartoons in animation.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/> Most animated cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits throughout the series to save time and money. This was most conspicuous amongst the girls in Ginger's age group (Dodie, Courtney, Macie, Miranda and Ginger herself) and some of the adults such as Ginger's mother. After Darren got his orthodontic headgear removed, he changed clothes as well. Carl's age group changes clothes only infrequently and with few changes. Hoodsey's coat rack has similar purple hoodies, satirizing cartoons whose characters always remain in the same outfits. Unlike most live-action shows whose characters only wear an outfit once, ''As Told by Ginger'' characters wear their outfits in rotation, and new outfits are added every few episodes.\n\nThe series also deals with several deeper themes.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Grabbing Viewers 'Tween 8 and 14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/movies/critic-s-notebook-grabbing-viewers-tween-8-and-14.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2002}}</ref> In \"Wicked Game\", Ginger's two best friends [[betray]] her after feeling [[jealousy]] toward her new boyfriend, Darren.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Wicked Game|series=As Told by Ginger|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|date=August 30, 2003|season=3|number=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Bullies and Mean Girls in Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndz4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6865-2|page=197}}</ref> In \"And She Was Gone\", the staff and students at school think Ginger is suicidally [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after she writes a disturbing poem that worries them.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|title=Kids Rule!: Nickelodeon and Consumer Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWrmQWznHGQC&pg=PA130|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3993-5|page=130}}</ref> In the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\", Carl's pranks cause his teacher to retire.

One tombstone reads \"ATBG\" while another reads \"RIP\". ATBG is short for ''As Told by Ginger'' and RIP is short for \"Rest in Peace\". This is a nod to the fact that the film is the series finale.\n* A girl named Leandra, who had a bone marrow illness and was a [[Make-A-Wish]] patient, was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments.

But this version was replaced before initial North American broadcasts with another version performed by [[Cree Summer]]. This would be used for half of the first season before a third version, featuring vocals by R&B artist [[Macy Gray]],<ref name=\"TweensNYT\"/> which was used for the rest of the series' run.\n\nIn the UK broadcasts, the Melissa Disney and Cree Summer versions were used for the first two seasons, while the Macy Gray version was used for season three. Internationally, the Macy Gray version is the most recognizable version.\n\n===Closing credits===\nThe closing credits are generally designed backgrounds with the show's signature font. These backgrounds include the ice cream cones from Ginger's bedroom walls, ladybugs from Dodie's bedroom walls, pencils, lizards and more. In several episodes, the ending theme is an rock-based instrumental, although there have been exceptions. \"Piece of My Heart\" ends with a different and softer instrumental melody. The episode \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" ended with a song called \"Wrong\", sung by voice actor [[Kenny Blank]] as Darren Patterson, and \"And She Was Gone\" ended with a musical version of Ginger's poem during the credits. The episode \"Come Back, Little Seal Girl\" featured the songs \"Courtney's World\" and \"The Little Seal Girl\" blended together. In \"About Face\", a song called \"Diamonds Are Expensive\", presumably sung by the engaged Lois and Dr. Dave, is played over the credits. \"Next Question\" ended with \"The Teen Seal Girl\" song. Finally, the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\" had no music during the credits, being dedicated to the memory of Kathleen Freeman.\n\n==Awards==\n* Three [[Emmy]] nominations for \"Hello Stranger\" (in 2001), \"Lunatic Lake\" (in 2002), and \"And She Was Gone\" (in 2003).

By the second season, they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age. In this season, Darren has his unwieldy [[orthodontic headgear]] that he has worn for the entire first season removed, which results in rising popularity. They graduate junior high in the middle of the third season and move on to becoming freshmen in high school. Carl's age group works in a same way, as they become junior high students by the third season. Many episodes make references to past episodes, giving the episodes a definite order.\n\nOne of the most noticeable developments is that the characters change clothes every episode and often newer every day within the same episode, a highly unusual characteristic of cartoons in animation.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/> Most animated cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits throughout the series to save time and money. This was most conspicuous amongst the girls in Ginger's age group (Dodie, Courtney, Macie, Miranda and Ginger herself) and some of the adults such as Ginger's mother. After Darren got his orthodontic headgear removed, he changed clothes as well. Carl's age group changes clothes only infrequently and with few changes. Hoodsey's coat rack has similar purple hoodies, satirizing cartoons whose characters always remain in the same outfits. Unlike most live-action shows whose characters only wear an outfit once, ''As Told by Ginger'' characters wear their outfits in rotation, and new outfits are added every few episodes.\n\nThe series also deals with several deeper themes.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Grabbing Viewers 'Tween 8 and 14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/movies/critic-s-notebook-grabbing-viewers-tween-8-and-14.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2002}}</ref> In \"Wicked Game\", Ginger's two best friends [[betray]] her after feeling [[jealousy]] toward her new boyfriend, Darren.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Wicked Game|series=As Told by Ginger|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|date=August 30, 2003|season=3|number=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Bullies and Mean Girls in Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndz4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6865-2|page=197}}</ref> In \"And She Was Gone\", the staff and students at school think Ginger is suicidally [[depressed]] after she writes a disturbing poem that worries them.<ref name=\"EW2016\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|title=Kids Rule!: Nickelodeon and Consumer Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWrmQWznHGQC&pg=PA130|accessdate=July 15, 2018|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3993-5|page=130}}</ref> In the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\", Carl's pranks cause his teacher to retire.

One tombstone reads \"ATBG\" while another reads \"RIP\". ATBG is short for ''As Told by Ginger'' and RIP is short for \"Rest in Peace\". This is a nod to the fact that the film is the series finale.\n* A girl named Leandra, who had a bone marrow illness and was a [[Make-A-Wish]] patient, was a fan of the series and watched it during her treatments.

But this version was replaced before initial North American broadcasts with another version performed by [[Cree Summer]]. This would be used for half of the first season before a third version, featuring vocals by R&B artist [[Macy Gray]],<ref name=\"TweensNYT\"/> which was used for the rest of the series' run.\n\nIn the UK broadcasts, the Melissa Disney and Cree Summer versions were used for the first two seasons, while the Macy Gray version was used for season three. Internationally, the Macy Gray version is the most recognizable version.\n\n===Closing credits===\nThe closing credits are generally designed backgrounds with the show's signature font. These backgrounds include the ice cream cones from Ginger's bedroom walls, ladybugs from Dodie's bedroom walls, pencils, lizards and more. In several episodes, the ending theme is an rock-based instrumental, although there have been exceptions. \"Piece of My Heart\" ends with a different and softer instrumental melody. The episode \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" ended with a song called \"Wrong\", sung by voice actor [[Kenny Blank]] as Darren Patterson, and \"And She Was Gone\" ended with a musical version of Ginger's poem during the credits. The episode \"Come Back, Little Seal Girl\" featured the songs \"Courtney's World\" and \"The Little Seal Girl\" blended together. In \"About Face\", a song called \"Diamonds Are Expensive\", presumably sung by the engaged Lois and Dr. Dave, is played over the credits. \"Next Question\" ended with \"The Teen Seal Girl\" song. Finally, the episode \"No Hope for Courtney\" had no music during the credits, being dedicated to the memory of Kathleen Freeman.\n\n==Awards==\n* Three [[Emmy]] nominations for \"Hello Stranger\" (in 2001), \"Lunatic Lake\" (in 2002), and \"And She Was Gone\" (in 2003).
