Following Vygotsky, some educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.<ref>Berk, L & Winsler, A.

He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone and autonomous learners.<ref name=\"Scaffolding\">''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database</ref> Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that math and writing did not come as naturally. Essentially, he concluded that because these concepts were taught in school settings with unnecessary assessments, they were of more difficulty to learners. Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.<ref name=\"Theories\">Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others.  They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. The term more knowledgeable others (MKO) is used to describe someone who has a better understanding or higher ability level than the learner, in reference to the specific task, idea, or concept.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2018, Aug 05). Lev Vygotsky.

Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and \"pull the students along.\"<ref name=\"Theories\" />\n\nVygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.<ref>Berk, L & Winsler, A.

The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.<ref>Burkitt, E. (2006). Zone of proximal development. In ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database</ref>\n\nAny function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function's actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors.<ref>Bozhovich, E.

Retrieved from EBSCOHost Database</ref> This context can impact the diagnosis of a function's potential level of development.<ref name=\"Zaretskii 2009\" />\n\nVygotsky stated that we can't just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher's job is to move the child's mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can't teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can't teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.<ref name=\"Theories\" /> An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.<ref name=\"Theories\" />\n\nIn the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky's definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context.<ref>Fani, Tayebeh & Ghaemi, Farid.

The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of \"support points\" for performing an action.<ref>Obukhova, L. F., & Korepanova, I. A. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development: A Spatiotemporal Model. ''Journal of Russian & East European Psychology'', 47(6), 25-47. {{doi|10.2753/RPO1061-0405470602}}</ref> This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer  to permit the child to work within the ZPD.<ref name=\"Morgan, A. 2009\">Morgan, A. (2009, July 28). What is \"Scaffolding\" and the \"ZPD\"? Retrieved October 13, 2014.</ref> Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.<ref name=\"Scaffolding\"/> According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.<ref name=\"Wass\">Wass, R., & Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.</ref>\n\nScaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary\u2014much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. \"Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions.\"<ref>Balaban, Nancy. (1995). \"Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person.\" In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52</ref> This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.<ref name=\"Morgan, A. 2009\"/>\n\nOne example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.<ref name=\"Wells 1999\">Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57</ref>\n\nIn mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.\n\nAnother example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.\n\nThe concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill.\n\n== Implications for educators ==\n[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|More knowledgeable others, like teachers, parents, and peers helped the learner to understand things that they cannot acquire by their own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Educational psychology : windows on classrooms|last=Eggen, Paul D.|others=Kauchak, Donald P., 1946-|year=2016|isbn=9780133549485|edition=Tenth|location=Boston|pages=|oclc=889941365}}</ref>{{Rp|80}}]]\nVarious investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.<ref>Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., & Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.</ref> Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.<ref name=\"Wass\" /> Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html</ref> In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.<ref>Kuusisaari, H. (2014). Teachers at the zone of proximal development: Collaboration promoting or hindering the development process. ''Teaching and Teacher Education'', ''43'', 46-57.</ref> Utilizing student's ZPD can assist especially with early childhood learning by guiding each child through challenges and using their student collaboration as a tool for success.\n\n==Challenges==\nScaffolding in education does have some boundaries. One of the largest hurdles to overcome when providing ample support for student learning is managing multiple students. While scaffolding is meant to be a relatively independent process for students, the initial phase of providing individual guidance can easily be overseen when managing large classrooms. Thus, time becomes a critical factor in a scaffolding lesson plan. In order to accommodate more learners, teachers are often faced with cutting parts of lessons or dedicating less time to each student.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gabriel Peters |url=https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-scaffolding-classroom-8008434.html |title=Advantages & Disadvantages of Scaffolding in |publisher=The Classroom |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> In turn, this hastened class time might result in loss of interest in students or even invalid peer-teaching. Cognitive abilities of the student also play a significant role in the success of scaffolding. Ideally, students are able to learn within this zone of proximal development, but this is often not the case. Recognizing students' individual abilities and foundation knowledge can be a challenge of successful scaffolding. If a student is evidently less prepared for this learning approach and begins to compare themselves to their peers, their self-efficacy and motivation to learn can be hindered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaffoldingliteracy.weebly.com/benefits-and-challenges-of-scaffolding.html|title=Benefits and Challenges of Scaffolding|website=Scaffolding Literacy}}</ref> These hurdles of scaffolding and the zone of proximal development are important to acknowledge so that teachers can find solutions to the problems or alter their teaching methods.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)]]\n* [[Curse of knowledge]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Social constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Sociocultural theory]]\n* [[Four stages of competence]]\n* [[Shuhari]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=zone of proximal development}}\n*Chaiklin, S.

The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill.\n\n== Implications for educators ==\n[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|More knowledgeable others, like teachers, parents, and peers helped the learner to understand things that they cannot acquire by their own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Educational psychology : windows on classrooms|last=Eggen, Paul D.|others=Kauchak, Donald P., 1946-|year=2016|isbn=9780133549485|edition=Tenth|location=Boston|pages=|oclc=889941365}}</ref>{{Rp|80}}]]\nVarious investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.<ref>Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., & Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.</ref> Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.<ref name=\"Wass\" /> Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development.<ref>McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html</ref> In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.<ref>Kuusisaari, H. (2014). Teachers at the zone of proximal development: Collaboration promoting or hindering the development process. ''Teaching and Teacher Education'', ''43'', 46-57.</ref> Utilizing student's ZPD can assist especially with early childhood learning by guiding each child through challenges and using their student collaboration as a tool for success.\n\n==Challenges==\nScaffolding in education does have some boundaries. One of the largest hurdles to overcome when providing ample support for student learning is managing multiple students. While scaffolding is meant to be a relatively independent process for students, the initial phase of providing individual guidance can easily be overseen when managing large classrooms. Thus, time becomes a critical factor in a scaffolding lesson plan. In order to accommodate more learners, teachers are often faced with cutting parts of lessons or dedicating less time to each student.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gabriel Peters |url=https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-scaffolding-classroom-8008434.html |title=Advantages & Disadvantages of Scaffolding in |publisher=The Classroom |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> In turn, this hastened class time might result in loss of interest in students or even invalid peer-teaching. Cognitive abilities of the student also play a significant role in the success of scaffolding. Ideally, students are able to learn within this zone of proximal development, but this is often not the case. Recognizing students' individual abilities and foundation knowledge can be a challenge of successful scaffolding. If a student is evidently less prepared for this learning approach and begins to compare themselves to their peers, their self-efficacy and motivation to learn can be hindered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaffoldingliteracy.weebly.com/benefits-and-challenges-of-scaffolding.html|title=Benefits and Challenges of Scaffolding|website=Scaffolding Literacy}}</ref> These hurdles of scaffolding and the zone of proximal development are important to acknowledge so that teachers can find solutions to the problems or alter their teaching methods.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)]]\n* [[Curse of knowledge]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Social constructivism (learning theory)]]\n* [[Sociocultural theory]]\n* [[Four stages of competence]]\n* [[Shuhari]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=zone of proximal development}}\n*Chaiklin, S.

Retrieved 27 January 2009.</ref> which has been represented by [[Kieran Mullan]] since the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]].\n\n== History of Willaston ==\nWillaston is believed to have taken its name from an ancient farmstead known as Wiglaf's tun. Like other English villages, the name has been changed many times over the centuries. This is due to the neighbouring parish of Wistaston having a similar sounding name. To add confusion, Willaston was once ecclesiastically divided between the neighbouring communities of Nantwich and Wybunbury.\n\nWhilst there are at least two other villages called Willaston, the earliest documentary evidence relating to Willaston in this part of Cheshire can be found in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey of 1086, where is it referred to as Wilavestune. We know by reading this document that a 'free man' by the name of Ulviet once owned Wilvastune and that, just a few years after the Norman conquest, the title passed to Willam Malbank. The manor of Wilvastune remained in the Malbank family for several generations before ownership transferred to the Chanu family in the 13th century.\n\nAt this time, Willaston was a remote, sparsely populated community with no village centre. Nevertheless, it covered a much larger area than it does today, stretching from Newcastle Road and London Road Nantwich in the south, along Millstone Lane and as far as the ancient grazing land of Beam Heath in the north. These boundaries did not change until 1936, when local government decided to transfer some of Willaston's land to the expanding communities of [[Nantwich]] and Stapeley. In 1553, the manor of Willaston was bought by Richard Sneyd. Recorder of Chester. The Sneyd family lived at [[Keele Hall]] in Staffordshire and were the major landowners in WIllaston until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Willaston had a number of farmsteads in the Middle Ages, most of the surrounding landscape was uncultivated. However, this began to change as more and more common land began to fall into private ownership during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The process (known as 'enclosure') brought major changes to rural communities such as Willaston, as individual plots of land were fenced off and used for arable farming, meadows and the grazing of livestock. The Sneyd family were absentee landlords but they owned most of the lands in Willaston from 1533 to the late 19th century.\n\nUnfortunately, the medieval moated site of the Chanu family was lost during the construction of the Nantwich by-pass in 1989. It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://willastonparishcouncil.org.uk/files/Willaston_Parish_Plan_2009.pdf|title=Willaston Parish Plan - History of Willaston|last=|first=|date=|website=Willaston Parish Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Local amenities==\nThe village centre of Willaston has two [[public house]]s (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an [[off-licence]] provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road.

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

(comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not cross over with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,
