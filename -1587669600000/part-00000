L., ed. ''The Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church'', p. 124, entry \"Atonement\". New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}} The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and [[Satan]], and thus death, by giving his own life as a [[ransom]] [[Sacrifice#Christianity|sacrifice]] to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]].\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c. 130\u2013c. 202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|pp=xliv, 114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while [[Justin Martyr]] had already equated Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|pp=5\u20136}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n===Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages===\nFollowing the [[Constantine I and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on [[Christology]], helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.<ref>''The resurrection and the icon'' by Michel Quenot 1998 {{ISBN|0-88141-149-3}} p. 72</ref>\n\nBelief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity.

Rotelle 1991 {{ISBN|0-911782-96-6}} p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th-century theology of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] provides an insight into the development of the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection. The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore's representation of the [[Eucharist]], the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the \"One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself\". Theodore's interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.<ref>''Adventus Domini: eschatological thought in 4th-century apses and catecheses'' by Geir Hellemo 1997 {{ISBN|90-04-08836-9}} p. 231</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint [[John of Damascus]] wrote that: \"...&nbsp;When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection\" and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.<ref>Vladimir Lossky, 1982 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|978-0-913836-99-6}} p. 189</ref>\n\n===Present-day===\nLorenzen finds \"a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits\".

For example, when the 2nd century BC author of the [[Book of Daniel]] wrote that \"many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken\" ({{Bibleref2-nb|Dan|12:2}}), he probably had in mind a rebirth as angelic beings (metaphorically described as stars in God's Heaven, stars having been identified with angels from early times). Such a rebirth would rule out a bodily resurrection, as angels were believed to be fleshless.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|pp=124\u2013125}} Other texts range from the traditional Old Testament view that the soul would spend eternity in the underworld, to a metaphorical belief in the raising of the spirit.{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|pp=31\u201332}} Most avoided defining what resurrection might imply, but a resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief.{{sfn|Endsj\u00f8|2009|p=145}}As Lehtipuu states, \"belief in resurrection was far from being an established doctrine of Second Temple Judaism\".{{sfn|Lehtipuu|2015|pp=32}}\n\n===Greco-Roman===\n{{Main|Apotheosis}}\nThe Greeks held that a meritorious man could be resurrected as a god (the process of ''apotheosis''), and the successors of [[Alexander the Great]] made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East through coins bearing his image, a privilege previously reserved for gods.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|p=131}} The idea was adopted by the Roman emperors, and in the Imperial Roman concept of apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor was replaced by a new and divine one as he ascended into heaven.{{sfn|Cotter|2001|pp=131, 135\u2013136}} The apotheosised dead remained recognisable to those who met them, as when [[Romulus]] appeared to witnesses after his death, but as the biographer [[Plutarch]] (c.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the first millennium AD, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}} The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and [[Satan]], and thus death, by giving his own life as a [[ransom]] [[Sacrifice#Christianity|sacrifice]] to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]].\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c. 130\u2013c. 202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|pp=xliv, 114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while [[Justin Martyr]] had already equated Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|pp=5\u20136}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n===Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages===\nFollowing the [[Constantine I and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on [[Christology]], helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.<ref>''The resurrection and the icon'' by Michel Quenot 1998 {{ISBN|0-88141-149-3}} p. 72</ref>\n\nBelief in bodily resurrection was a constant note of the Christian church in antiquity.

Green 1996 {{ISBN|0-19-826334-1}} p. 115</ref> Moreover, he argued that the death and resurrection of Jesus was for the salvation of man, stating: \"to achieve each resurrection of ours, the savior paid with his single life, and he pre-enacted and presented his one and only one by way of sacrament and by way of model.\"<ref>''The Trinity'' by Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.), Edmund Hill, John E. Rotelle 1991 {{ISBN|0-911782-96-6}} p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th-century theology of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] provides an insight into the development of the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of resurrection. The crucial role of the sacraments in the mediation of salvation was well accepted at the time. In Theodore's representation of the [[Eucharist]], the sacrificial and salvific elements are combined in the \"One who saved us and delivered us by the sacrifice of Himself\". Theodore's interpretation of the Eucharistic rite is directed towards the triumph over the power of death brought about by the resurrection.<ref>''Adventus Domini: eschatological thought in 4th-century apses and catecheses'' by Geir Hellemo 1997 {{ISBN|90-04-08836-9}} p. 231</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on the salvific nature of the resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint [[John of Damascus]] wrote that: \"...&nbsp;When he had freed those who were bound from the beginning of time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for us the way to resurrection\" and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.<ref>Vladimir Lossky, 1982 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|978-0-913836-99-6}} p. 189</ref>\n\n===Present-day===\nLorenzen finds \"a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits\".

An early symbol of the resurrection was the wreathed [[Chi Rho]] (Greek letters representing the word \"Khristos\" or \"Christ\"), whose origin traces to the victory of [[emperor Constantine I]] at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312, which he attributed to the use of a cross on the shields of his soldiers.
