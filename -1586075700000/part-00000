With local anesthesia, a person is awake while sedated. Local anesthesia lasts for a short period of time and is often used for minor outpatient procedures (when patients come in for surgery and can go home that same day). For someone having outpatient surgery in a clinic or doctor's office (such as the dentist or dermatologist), this anesthetic is likely used. The medicine can numb the area during the procedure and for a short time afterwards to help control post-surgery discomfort. \n\nThe function of this instrument involves successfully piercing the surface of the periodontal ligament so the patient can be distributed the anesthesia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite patent|title=Dental instrument-PDL syringe|gdate=1983-05-20|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4444560A/en}}</ref> Past devices have proven to be insufficient because it instilled fear in patients and made it exhaustingly uncomfortable for dentists to use because of the bulky size.<ref name=\":0\" /> With how simple it is to hide it in the hand due to the smaller size of modern day anesthetic syringes, dentists are successfully able to maneuver in a patient's mouth without causing harm to the patient being treated, allowing for a quick insert of the anesthesia followed by the dentist being able move on swiftly to the next task of the dental visit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another aspect of the syringe is the capability of use, which means dentists are able to easily insert fluid in the device and follow the color coded instructions that allow for efficient use of the dental instrument.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite patent|title=All purpose dental syringe|gdate=1981-10-26|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4472141A/en}}</ref> The device is so intricately sized that doctors are able to grip it well enough to get the job done.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some Anesthetic Syringes also include a power handle that gives the doctor less of a responsibility over the amount of pressure needed to push in the medicine because the power handle has settings that let the Dentist set an amount for how much anesthetic they want to be produced.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Dental handpieces==\n[[Image:Dentalhandpiece0111-26-05.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A high-speed [[dental handpiece]].]]\n{{Main|Dental drill}}\nDental handpieces come in many various types which include: High speed air driven (also known as an airotor), slow speed, friction grip, surgical hand piece.\n\n==Dental laser==\nA [[dental laser]] is a type of [[laser]] designed specifically for use in [[oral surgery]] or [[dentistry]].\n\nThe use of a laser can decrease [[morbidity]] after surgery, and reduces the need for [[anesthetics]].

Some of the most common are: the round bur (sizes \u00bc to 10) or inverted cone (sizes 33\u00bd to 90L).\nBurs are also classified by the type of shank. For instance a latch type, or right angle bur, is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur, which is a small bur, is used only in the high-speed handpiece.\n\nThere are many bur shapes that are utilized in various specific procedures.\n\n===Operative burs===\nFlat fissure, pear-shaped, football, round, tapered, flame, chamfer, bevel, end cut,\nbud bur, steel, inverted cone, diamond, brown stone, and green-stone\n\n==Restorative instruments==\n\n===Excavators ===\n*Spoon excavator: Used to remove soft carious decay.\n*Half hollenbach: Used to test for overhangs or flash.\n*Dental hatchers: Used to widen the entrance of the tooth cavity and slice away the thin carious enamel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drchetan.com/different-types-of-dental-excavators.html|title=Dental excavators|website=www.drchetan.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n*Chisels: \n**Straight - bevels the cavosurface margin and used in 3, 4 and 5 classifications of cavities on the maxillary.\n**Wedelstaedt - only used in the anterior for classes 3, 4 and 5 as well.\n**Bin Angle - this is held in a pen grasp and used for class 2 maxillary only.\n\n==Burnishers==\n*Flat plastic\n*Ball burnisher\n*Beavertail burnisher\n*Cone burnisher\n*Pear shaped burnisher\nBurnishers are used for polishing and contouring amalgam fillings and to polish   composite fillings.\n\n==Pluggers==\nPluggers are also known as amalgam condensers.

The medicine can numb the area during the procedure and for a short time afterwards to help control post-surgery discomfort. \n\nThe function of this instrument involves successfully piercing the surface of the periodontal ligament so the patient can be distributed the anesthesia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite patent|title=Dental instrument-PDL syringe|gdate=1983-05-20|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4444560A/en}}</ref> Past devices have proven to be insufficient because it instilled fear in patients and made it exhaustingly uncomfortable for dentists to use because of the bulky size.<ref name=\":0\" /> With how simple it is to hide it in the hand due to the smaller size of modern day anesthetic syringes, dentists are successfully able to maneuver in a patient's mouth without causing harm to the patient being treated, allowing for a quick insert of the anesthesia followed by the dentist being able move on swiftly to the next task of the dental visit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another aspect of the syringe is the capability of use, which means dentists are able to easily insert fluid in the device and follow the color coded instructions that allow for efficient use of the dental instrument.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite patent|title=All purpose dental syringe|gdate=1981-10-26|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4472141A/en}}</ref> The device is so intricately sized that doctors are able to grip it well enough to get the job done.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some Anesthetic Syringes also include a power handle that gives the doctor less of a responsibility over the amount of pressure needed to push in the medicine because the power handle has settings that let the Dentist set an amount for how much anesthetic they want to be produced.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Dental handpieces==\n[[Image:Dentalhandpiece0111-26-05.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A high-speed [[dental handpiece]].]]\n{{Main|Dental drill}}\nDental handpieces come in many various types which include: High speed air driven (also known as an airotor), slow speed, friction grip, surgical hand piece.\n\n==Dental laser==\nA [[dental laser]] is a type of [[laser]] designed specifically for use in [[oral surgery]] or [[dentistry]].\n\nThe use of a laser can decrease [[morbidity]] after surgery, and reduces the need for [[anesthetics]].

As the decade was about to conclude, the band's drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as [[The Joe Perry Project]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone\" />\n\nSince there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the next full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of \"[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]\" by [[the Shangri-Las]], peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\nThe tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]], and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]''. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band's best selling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373\u2013374</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'', and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\", was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band, and decided to form a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]], which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>\n\nWith [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> Only one single charted, the aforementioned \"Lightning Strikes\", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do.

As a partnership, the primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often collectively known as the \"[[Toxic Twins]]\".\n\nPerry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist [[Ray Tabano]], and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.

The standalone single \"[[Chip Away the Stone]]\", also released in 1978, charted at number 77.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\n===Departures of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, ''Night in the Ruts'', and ''Rock in a Hard Place'' (1979\u20131984)===\nIn 1979, the band started work on their next album, ''[[Night in the Ruts]]'', but Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule. As the decade was about to conclude, the band's drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as [[The Joe Perry Project]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone\" />\n\nSince there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the next full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of \"[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]\" by [[the Shangri-Las]], peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\nThe tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]], and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]''. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band's best selling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373\u2013374</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'', and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\", was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band, and decided to form a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]], which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>\n\nWith [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> Only one single charted, the aforementioned \"Lightning Strikes\", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a homecoming arena show in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.<ref>Davis, p. 400</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 1984, Perry (by then divorced from his first wife Elissa) and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston's [[Orpheum Theatre (Boston)|Orpheum Theater]]. Shortly thereafter, discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later, the original members of Aerosmith officially reunited.<ref>Davis, p. 417</ref> Steven Tyler recalls:{{cquote|You should have felt the buzz the moment all five of us got together in the same room for the first time again.

In 1986, Tyler completed a successful [[drug rehabilitation]] program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]], who believed that the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated in time. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years.

The group went on [[Permanent Vacation Tour|a subsequent tour]] with labelmates [[Guns N' Roses]] (who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence), which was intense at times because of Aerosmith's new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N' Roses' well-publicized, rampant drug use.<ref>Davis, pp. 460\u2013461</ref>\n{{Listen|filename=Aerosmith - Janie's Got a Gun.ogg|title=\"Janie's Got a Gun\"\n|description=Sample of \"[[Janie's Got a Gun]]\" by Aerosmith, from ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' (1989)\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n|pos=left}}\n\nAerosmith's next album was even more successful.

In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in the north-east of [[Algeria]], about 248 miles (400&nbsp;km) from [[Algiers]], 71 miles (115&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] and 137 miles (222&nbsp;km) north of [[Touggourt]]. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of [[Sahara|the Sahara Desert]]. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a hub and a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] and [[the Arabs]] to the French.\n\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French [[garrison]].<ref name=\"WDL2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8784/ |title = Market, Biskra, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 25 September 2013 }}</ref> The town was used as a military post, and was the scene of severe fighting in the rebellions of 1849 and 1871. By 1935, Biskra was the principal settlement of a Saharan [[oasis]] watered by the intermittent ''[[Oued]] Biskra''.\n\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of, Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and a popular winter resort.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nThe city has been known by several names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} say its name comes down from the name Vescera, which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its geographical location that connects north to south. But the Roman leader Betolimih BenyoubaII gave it another name, \"the river of destiny\", which is due to the river of Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome researchers{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that its name originates from the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name \"Adebesran,\" due to the ancient geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that the real name comes down from the word \"Sokkra\", due to the better quality of the sweet dates that this city has everywhere in its oases. Still others{{Who|date=September 2019}} claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Biskra Story.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n=== Gaetuli ===\nThe [[Gaetuli]] first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled on a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania.{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2019}} The Genset, a direct descendant of the branch of the Capesian civilization that migrated to the Sahara around 3000 BC, and is certainly the people who dominated in the most certain way Algeria during the 1500 years of its antiquity. They were according to the Greek historian Strabo the most numerous people of North Africa, but also the least known. Among the oldest references to the G\u00e9tules are probably those of the Carthaginians who indicate that the Prince of the G\u00e9tules proposed to marry \u00c9lyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present Tunisia) around the year 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC about in the reign of Akhenaton of the eighteenth dynasty that speaks of cattle trade with this people.\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are probably also the origin of [[Berber calendar|the Berber calendar]] which begins around 943\u2013949 BC. The beginning of this calendar would follow the victory of a coalition of G\u00e9tules over [[Egypt|the Egyptians]]. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left the south-west of Algeria, reinforcing its force en route wherever it passed in North Africa. The coalition led by [[Sheshonq]] (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh [[Psousennes II]]. Following this victory Sheshnaq married the daughter of the pharaoh, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the [[XXII Dynasty]]. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe. (The Berber calendar is a creation of Ammar NEGADI, it is he who chose this date for origin, his calendar was published in 1980 through the Association Union du Peuple Amazigh -UPA).\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are the Berber nomads of the pre-Saharan of North Africa and speak the Berber language with some variations. They came from the desert of the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland sea, bordering present-day Iran) and were forced to migrate following the destruction of a natural dam that left them without a water source for their livestock.  Specialists of the desert life, they first settled on the edge of the Nile.  However, the Pharaohs hunted them in the sixth century BC.\n\nAlways while traversing the desert, arrived until Tassili with the Touaregs where they stayed a long time, got mixed up with the Touaregs and learned the Tamazigh language for reasons of communication, cultural and commercial exchanges. Unfortunately felt like \"Gringos\" in these places, decided to continue path until \"The Promised Land\":\n\nNorth Africa which has become almost theirs. In Algeria, they have set themselves at the limit of [[Aures]] for the dish to which they are accustomed, have posed problems to the Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC because dreaded in combat and good horsemen. It was necessary to involve a late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] politician, Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them\nand so diminished in their strength. Thus, the G\u00e9tulie was occupied by the Romans (Biskra and its environs). This is what I learned from Charles Andr\u00e9s Julien and Courteau, both history teachers at the Sorbonne and specialists in North Africa.\n\n===The Romans Colonisation===\nThe city of Biskra experienced many very violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the great resistance war led by the Berber leader [[Tacfarinas]]. Followed by his successor the great healed militant [[Jugurtha]] \"Youghorta\" who resisted the Roman army. With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who did not hesitate to give their human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Noumidia region.\n\n===The Vandals in the 4th century===\n[[The Vandals]] \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land after a language resistance of its inhabitants. The weakness of the Vandals and lure falls in front of the resistance and the continuous fights of the inhabitants, forced them to integrate with the inhabitants of the Ziban in a complete way. \nAfter a few decades, the Romans took over the direction of the city where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\n===The arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa El Fihri in the 7th century AD===\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa Elfehri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under another monarchy. it was the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Okba Ben Nafaa died in 683 AD with his army when he returned from Morocco. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at the place called Tahouda, a small village located 5&nbsp;km from the oasis \"[[Sidi Okba]]\" whose body of this conqueror is based in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, this place which contains more than 300 tombs, is the 4th holy place of [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Al-Aqsa Compound|Aksa]].\n\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\n===The Hillal Bannis in the 12th century AD===\nFollowed by the kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century AD.\n\n===The Hafsids in the 14th century AD===\nIn the 14th century AD, the Hafssid arrived in [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. Biskra became a very important pole for the Hafsids of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of M\u00e9rinides of [[Fez]] and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of [[Tlemcen]].\n\n===The conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541===\nIn 1541, the conquest of the city by the Turks began, under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of [[Algiers]] at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\n\n[[The Ottoman Empire]] remained in the city 3 centuries until the French colonization in 1830.\n\n===French colonization from 1844===\nIndeed, after the invasion of the city of Biskra in 1844, and due to its protective geographical nature, the French army, built a secure area in its agglomeration to oppose the popular resistance of the inhabitants. But the progress of the liberation movement of El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, the successor or \"caliphate\" of El-Emir Abdelkader who went to General Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847, destroyed his armor and returned to a war of two fronts, the first against the Ben Ghana family and the French forces and the second front against the pillaging and embezzlement of Ahmed Bey and his monarchy in Constantine.\n\nThus, the opposition and the refusal of the rebels continued until the war of Zaatcha 20 kilometers west of Biskra in 1849. The refusal threatened the French to drag on throughout the Ziban area and could even spreading to Aur\u00e8s under the leadership of Sheikh Bou Zian, who refused to pay the palm tax, Lieutenant Seroka, of the Arab Bureau of Biskra, the Zaatcha affair began.\n\nDuring this first period, the war of Bou Zian, chief of tribe, is memorable. The columns entered the gardens, delimited by small walls, which surrounded the Ksours in the oases and formed an inextricable maze. The shooting was terrible, the natives retreated but there are already several dead and many wounded, finished with the knife by Bou Zian, and his men. Carbuccia, the French Colonel withdrew. The failure was serious, the moral effect disastrous. Bou Zian exploited his victory and sent burning letters to the AURES and ZIBAN people ...\n\nArrived in front of the zone called Zaatcha the French met a bastioned wall, crenellated, preceded by a ditch of 7 meters wide and 1 to 3 meters deep filled with water.\n\nColonel Carbuccia in charge of this mission was surprised by the topography of the ground and the resistance which opposed him in the middle of a dense vegetation. The struggles and fights continued for 7 months without stopping. It took 7,000 troops and 53 days of blockade for the destruction of the siege by the three colonels together: Canrobert, Barral, and Lourmel giving the death of Chief Bouzian with 1400 besieged and 2130 people on the French side.\n\nThis defeat did not diminish the will of the inhabitants to resist against the forces of the French armies. Indeed, the inhabitants led many wars the most known, was the war of El-kamri in 1879.\n\nAfter nearly 100 years of events in Zaatcha, and in 1954, Biskra was among the important place where the war of 1 November began notably in the mountains of Aur\u00e8s and in the adobe villages, all surrounded by palm trees, with the walls and the saguias separating the gardens, present to the assailant considerable difficultie.\n\n===In culture===\nBiskra is the setting of key sections of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s 1902 novel ''[[The Immoralist]]'' and lesser known 1897 prose-poem ''[[Les nourritures terrestres]]'' (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], following a meeting with [[Oscar Wilde]] in [[Blida]] and [[Algiers]].<!-- This was a very significant time for Gide \u2013 and he writes about his meetings with Wilde at great length. -->\n\nThe French artist [[Henri Matisse]] has a work titled [[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]] an oil painting finished in 1907.\n\nThe Hungarian composer [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe Polish composer [[Karol Szymanowski]], who traveled to North Africa, seemed to have been quite impressed by Biskra.

In the outskirts of Biskra, the landscape is very arid with all the same vegetation that vary depending on the location. Small water points can be found in the outskirts of Biskra, especially in the oases and canyons of the mountains around [[El Kantara]]. The prefecture of Biskra is crossed by Oued Labiod waterways, Oued El Arab, Djedi, Oued Mezira\u00e2, Oued El and Oued el Gantara. The city covers an area of 127.55 km2 (49.25 sq mi).

Whether winter or summer, the time is always the same in Biskra. The sunrise is around 7:41&nbsp;am to 21 December and 5:24&nbsp;am on 21 June. The sunset is around 5:30&nbsp;pm on 21 December and at 7:54&nbsp;pm on 21 June.\n\n===Cityscape===\n[[File:Biskra Cityscape.jpg|550px|thumb|center|Biskra Cityscape.]]\n\n[[File:Biskra City U.jpg|550px|thumb|center|[[Biskra University]].]]\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:BiskraNigthStreet.jpg|thumb|left|Street of Biskra at night]]\n[[File:Biskra Street.jpg|thumb|right|Biskra Street]]\n[[File:BiskraCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Biskra Sunset from City Center]]\n\nThe city of Biskra has gone through three phases before getting to where she is today. Started by the pre-colonial phase which testifies, that the city was pending this period under Roman rule over country of the Berbers, and having taken the role of the capital of southern Numidia, and the\n\nA very prosperous city, built by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. During [[Turkic peoples|the Turkish]] period the city was hit by epidemics, binding occupiers of the fort to leave the city to settle, in a group scattered the interior of the palm grove, south of the city, around two elements of the form local production, the built environment that are the mosque and seguias, besides the use local building materials.\n\nSecondly, the city was marked by the colonial phase characterized by the building of fort saint germain on the northern part, and the construction of a city (the colonial checkerboard) by an urban model, different from the previous one, and having undergone several extension, particularly the 1st and 2nd and the Dervau Plan, followed during the 50s, by popular extensions to the South at the expense of the palm grove and without dimensional and formal logic.\n\nIn the end the post colonial phase characterized by the proliferation of self-built no plan to urban and architectural quality at least and without model, where typological reference, which has only to be curbed, after the instruction of the laws intervention and control of the state, over the urban space, by launching large Housing development operations in the framework of ZUNH, in the form of housing communal collective or subdivision which, despite this, has not been able to resolve the demand for housing, bringing the state to promulgation, other laws havingobjective, improving urban quality, openness and diversification stakeholders.\n\nToday, the city of Biskra is made up of 28 neighborhoods including 3 main ones which are, Korra, City 60 Logts ENICAB and Equipment Zones.\n\n===Climate===\nBiskra has a [[subtropical]] [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') typical of the region in which it is found. The city has long and extremely hot summers and short, pleasantly warm winters. In summer, the peaks of heat are among the highest in the country with temperatures that can exceed 120&nbsp;\u00b0F (48&nbsp;\u00b0C) and are similar to cities like [[Luxor]] or [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

In comparison, New York City has had a total of 59 days when the temperature was equivalent to or above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) since 1870. Temperatures generally begin to approach or even exceed 94&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) by April. Biskra is one of the hottest cities in the country when it comes to daytime temperatures. Indeed, this one is often higher than (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the hottest months.

Rainfall is limited to only 128.8&nbsp;mm per year.

The wettest month is November with (20.1&nbsp;mm), while July is the driest month with (1.7&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe hot, dry and sunny climate of the city sometimes attracts some inhabitants of the northern regions as in the city of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] located 115&nbsp;km northeast, which experiences fairly icy and wet winters during this period, to enjoy the pleasant weather and sunny in winter.\n\nOn average, Biskra knows no day in the year with a temperature below zero. Moving away from the urban area, the risk of frost may be more frequent and night temperatures are lower. Biskra very rarely experiences freezing days and only occurs occasionally during periods of mild cold weather. what can happen to Biskra and its surroundings. The record for the largest number of frost days recorded at Biskra in a winter is 1980\u20131981 with 73 days, while the record for the number of consecutive years experiencing freeze-up in Biskra is 1886 years. 1888.

[[Biskra Province]], Algeria. In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in the north-east of [[Algeria]], about 248 miles (400&nbsp;km) from [[Algiers]], 71 miles (115&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] and 137 miles (222&nbsp;km) north of [[Touggourt]]. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of [[Sahara|the Sahara Desert]]. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a hub and a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] and [[the Arabs]] to the French.\n\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French [[garrison]].<ref name=\"WDL2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8784/ |title = Market, Biskra, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 25 September 2013 }}</ref> The town was used as a military post, and was the scene of severe fighting in the rebellions of 1849 and 1871. By 1935, Biskra was the principal settlement of a Saharan [[oasis]] watered by the intermittent ''[[Oued]] Biskra''.\n\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of, Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and a popular winter resort.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nThe city has been known by several names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} say its name comes down from the name Vescera, which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its geographical location that connects north to south. But the Roman leader Betolimih BenyoubaII gave it another name, \"the river of destiny\", which is due to the river of Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome researchers{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that its name originates from the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name \"Adebesran,\" due to the ancient geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that the real name comes down from the word \"Sokkra\", due to the better quality of the sweet dates that this city has everywhere in its oases. Still others{{Who|date=September 2019}} claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Biskra Story.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n=== Gaetuli ===\nThe [[Gaetuli]] first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled on a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania.{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2019}} The Genset, a direct descendant of the branch of the Capesian civilization that migrated to the Sahara around 3000 BC, and is certainly the people who dominated in the most certain way Algeria during the 1500 years of its antiquity. They were according to the Greek historian Strabo the most numerous people of North Africa, but also the least known. Among the oldest references to the G\u00e9tules are probably those of the Carthaginians who indicate that the Prince of the G\u00e9tules proposed to marry \u00c9lyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present Tunisia) around the year 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC about in the reign of Akhenaton of the eighteenth dynasty that speaks of cattle trade with this people.\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are probably also the origin of [[Berber calendar|the Berber calendar]] which begins around 943\u2013949 BC. The beginning of this calendar would follow the victory of a coalition of G\u00e9tules over [[Egypt|the Egyptians]]. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left the south-west of Algeria, reinforcing its force en route wherever it passed in North Africa. The coalition led by [[Sheshonq]] (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh [[Psousennes II]]. Following this victory Sheshnaq married the daughter of the pharaoh, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the [[XXII Dynasty]]. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe. (The Berber calendar is a creation of Ammar NEGADI, it is he who chose this date for origin, his calendar was published in 1980 through the Association Union du Peuple Amazigh -UPA).\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are the Berber nomads of the pre-Saharan of North Africa and speak the Berber language with some variations. They came from the desert of the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland sea, bordering present-day Iran) and were forced to migrate following the destruction of a natural dam that left them without a water source for their livestock.  Specialists of the desert life, they first settled on the edge of the Nile.  However, the Pharaohs hunted them in the sixth century BC.\n\nAlways while traversing the desert, arrived until Tassili with the Touaregs where they stayed a long time, got mixed up with the Touaregs and learned the Tamazigh language for reasons of communication, cultural and commercial exchanges. Unfortunately felt like \"Gringos\" in these places, decided to continue path until \"The Promised Land\":\n\nNorth Africa which has become almost theirs. In Algeria, they have set themselves at the limit of [[Aures]] for the dish to which they are accustomed, have posed problems to the Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC because dreaded in combat and good horsemen. It was necessary to involve a late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] politician, Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them\nand so diminished in their strength. Thus, the G\u00e9tulie was occupied by the Romans (Biskra and its environs). This is what I learned from Charles Andr\u00e9s Julien and Courteau, both history teachers at the Sorbonne and specialists in North Africa.\n\n===The Romans Colonisation===\nThe city of Biskra experienced many very violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the great resistance war led by the Berber leader [[Tacfarinas]]. Followed by his successor the great healed militant [[Jugurtha]] \"Youghorta\" who resisted the Roman army. With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who did not hesitate to give their human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Noumidia region.\n\n===The Vandals in the 4th century===\n[[The Vandals]] \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land after a language resistance of its inhabitants. The weakness of the Vandals and lure falls in front of the resistance and the continuous fights of the inhabitants, forced them to integrate with the inhabitants of the Ziban in a complete way. \nAfter a few decades, the Romans took over the direction of the city where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\n===The arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa El Fihri in the 7th century AD===\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa Elfehri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under another monarchy. it was the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Okba Ben Nafaa died in 683 AD with his army when he returned from Morocco. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at the place called Tahouda, a small village located 5&nbsp;km from the oasis \"[[Sidi Okba]]\" whose body of this conqueror is based in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, this place which contains more than 300 tombs, is the 4th holy place of [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Al-Aqsa Compound|Aksa]].\n\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\n===The Hillal Bannis in the 12th century AD===\nFollowed by the kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century AD.\n\n===The Hafsids in the 14th century AD===\nIn the 14th century AD, the Hafssid arrived in [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. Biskra became a very important pole for the Hafsids of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of M\u00e9rinides of [[Fez]] and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of [[Tlemcen]].\n\n===The conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541===\nIn 1541, the conquest of the city by the Turks began, under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of [[Algiers]] at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\n\n[[The Ottoman Empire]] remained in the city 3 centuries until the French colonization in 1830.\n\n===French colonization from 1844===\nIndeed, after the invasion of the city of Biskra in 1844, and due to its protective geographical nature, the French army, built a secure area in its agglomeration to oppose the popular resistance of the inhabitants. But the progress of the liberation movement of El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, the successor or \"caliphate\" of El-Emir Abdelkader who went to General Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847, destroyed his armor and returned to a war of two fronts, the first against the Ben Ghana family and the French forces and the second front against the pillaging and embezzlement of Ahmed Bey and his monarchy in Constantine.\n\nThus, the opposition and the refusal of the rebels continued until the war of Zaatcha 20 kilometers west of Biskra in 1849. The refusal threatened the French to drag on throughout the Ziban area and could even spreading to Aur\u00e8s under the leadership of Sheikh Bou Zian, who refused to pay the palm tax, Lieutenant Seroka, of the Arab Bureau of Biskra, the Zaatcha affair began.\n\nDuring this first period, the war of Bou Zian, chief of tribe, is memorable. The columns entered the gardens, delimited by small walls, which surrounded the Ksours in the oases and formed an inextricable maze. The shooting was terrible, the natives retreated but there are already several dead and many wounded, finished with the knife by Bou Zian, and his men. Carbuccia, the French Colonel withdrew. The failure was serious, the moral effect disastrous. Bou Zian exploited his victory and sent burning letters to the AURES and ZIBAN people ...\n\nArrived in front of the zone called Zaatcha the French met a bastioned wall, crenellated, preceded by a ditch of 7 meters wide and 1 to 3 meters deep filled with water.\n\nColonel Carbuccia in charge of this mission was surprised by the topography of the ground and the resistance which opposed him in the middle of a dense vegetation. The struggles and fights continued for 7 months without stopping. It took 7,000 troops and 53 days of blockade for the destruction of the siege by the three colonels together: Canrobert, Barral, and Lourmel giving the death of Chief Bouzian with 1400 besieged and 2130 people on the French side.\n\nThis defeat did not diminish the will of the inhabitants to resist against the forces of the French armies. Indeed, the inhabitants led many wars the most known, was the war of El-kamri in 1879.\n\nAfter nearly 100 years of events in Zaatcha, and in 1954, Biskra was among the important place where the war of 1 November began notably in the mountains of Aur\u00e8s and in the adobe villages, all surrounded by palm trees, with the walls and the saguias separating the gardens, present to the assailant considerable difficultie.\n\n===In culture===\nBiskra is the setting of key sections of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s 1902 novel ''[[The Immoralist]]'' and lesser known 1897 prose-poem ''[[Les nourritures terrestres]]'' (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], following a meeting with [[Oscar Wilde]] in [[Blida]] and [[Algiers]].<!-- This was a very significant time for Gide \u2013 and he writes about his meetings with Wilde at great length. -->\n\nThe French artist [[Henri Matisse]] has a work titled [[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]] an oil painting finished in 1907.\n\nThe Hungarian composer [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe Polish composer [[Karol Szymanowski]], who traveled to North Africa, seemed to have been quite impressed by Biskra. This trip probably aroused a genuine interest for the North African/ Arabic culture. He composed many pieces influenced by his experience there. He sent a post card from Biskra on 11 April 1914.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDiana Mayo, protagonist of [[Edith Maude Hull]]'s popular 1919 novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'', starts her journey into the desert from Biskra, and in the identically-named 1921 [[silent movie]] ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' starring [[Rudolph Valentino]] in perhaps his most famous role.\n\nWinston Churchill's cousin, sculptress and author [[Clare Sheridan]] held a salon in Biskra in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=time>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=A Modest Proposal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884346,00.html |quote=...

Part of the city is surrounded by the Sfa Pass and the [[Aures, Algeria|Ziban Mountains]]. In the outskirts of Biskra, the landscape is very arid with all the same vegetation that vary depending on the location. Small water points can be found in the outskirts of Biskra, especially in the oases and canyons of the mountains around [[El Kantara]]. The prefecture of Biskra is crossed by Oued Labiod waterways, Oued El Arab, Djedi, Oued Mezira\u00e2, Oued El and Oued el Gantara. The city covers an area of 127.55 km2 (49.25 sq mi).

The sunset is around 5:30&nbsp;pm on 21 December and at 7:54&nbsp;pm on 21 June.\n\n===Cityscape===\n[[File:Biskra Cityscape.jpg|550px|thumb|center|Biskra Cityscape.]]\n\n[[File:Biskra City U.jpg|550px|thumb|center|[[Biskra University]].]]\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:BiskraNigthStreet.jpg|thumb|left|Street of Biskra at night]]\n[[File:Biskra Street.jpg|thumb|right|Biskra Street]]\n[[File:BiskraCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Biskra Sunset from City Center]]\n\nThe city of Biskra has gone through three phases before getting to where she is today. Started by the pre-colonial phase which testifies, that the city was pending this period under Roman rule over country of the Berbers, and having taken the role of the capital of southern Numidia, and the\n\nA very prosperous city, built by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. During [[Turkic peoples|the Turkish]] period the city was hit by epidemics, binding occupiers of the fort to leave the city to settle, in a group scattered the interior of the palm grove, south of the city, around two elements of the form local production, the built environment that are the mosque and seguias, besides the use local building materials.\n\nSecondly, the city was marked by the colonial phase characterized by the building of fort saint germain on the northern part, and the construction of a city (the colonial checkerboard) by an urban model, different from the previous one, and having undergone several extension, particularly the 1st and 2nd and the Dervau Plan, followed during the 50s, by popular extensions to the South at the expense of the palm grove and without dimensional and formal logic.\n\nIn the end the post colonial phase characterized by the proliferation of self-built no plan to urban and architectural quality at least and without model, where typological reference, which has only to be curbed, after the instruction of the laws intervention and control of the state, over the urban space, by launching large Housing development operations in the framework of ZUNH, in the form of housing communal collective or subdivision which, despite this, has not been able to resolve the demand for housing, bringing the state to promulgation, other laws havingobjective, improving urban quality, openness and diversification stakeholders.\n\nToday, the city of Biskra is made up of 28 neighborhoods including 3 main ones which are, Korra, City 60 Logts ENICAB and Equipment Zones.\n\n===Climate===\nBiskra has a [[subtropical]] [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') typical of the region in which it is found. The city has long and extremely hot summers and short, pleasantly warm winters. In summer, the peaks of heat are among the highest in the country with temperatures that can exceed 120&nbsp;\u00b0F (48&nbsp;\u00b0C) and are similar to cities like [[Luxor]] or [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The average peak July temperature, which is the hottest month, is about 108&nbsp;\u00b0F (42&nbsp;\u00b0C). On average, the city experiences more than 92 days a year where the temperature is equal to or exceeds 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) and nearly 20 days above 110&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C). In comparison, New York City has had a total of 59 days when the temperature was equivalent to or above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) since 1870. Temperatures generally begin to approach or even exceed 94&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) by April. Biskra is one of the hottest cities in the country when it comes to daytime temperatures. Indeed, this one is often higher than (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the hottest months.

On 14 July 1910, the temperature reached 124&nbsp;\u00b0F (51&nbsp;\u00b0C) which is the record of heat in Biskra.\n\n[[File:Biskra Haboob.jpg|thumb|right|A 2018 Haboob]]\n[[File:Biskra parc.jpg|thumb|left|A rain at Biskra]]\n\nThe climate is very dry and mostly very clear. Rainfall is limited to only 128.8&nbsp;mm per year. Precipitation is quite rare despite some showers usually during the coldest months, mainly January and February, where it rains several times in the season, which brings the majority of humidity to Biskra in a year. The highest precipitation record recorded in Biskra in a year is (600.5&nbsp;mm) in 1910 while the driest year is only (27.7&nbsp;mm) recorded in 1945.

The month with the highest air rate in Biskra is December with 59% humidity, July is the least heavy month with only 27% on average per year. Aside from rainfall or humidity, sandstorms can occur several times a month and even become [[Haboob]], which can make visibility almost zero. Biskra has a very good duration of sunshine in the year with an average of 3,292 hours of sunshine a year. The wettest month is November with (20.1&nbsp;mm), while July is the driest month with (1.7&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe hot, dry and sunny climate of the city sometimes attracts some inhabitants of the northern regions as in the city of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] located 115&nbsp;km northeast, which experiences fairly icy and wet winters during this period, to enjoy the pleasant weather and sunny in winter.\n\nOn average, Biskra knows no day in the year with a temperature below zero. If we move away from the urban area, the risk of frost may be more frequent and night temperatures are lower.

Grandon]]) proclaims his love for Ramona, but she rejects him because she has fallen for Alessandro. They fall deeply in love, yet their desire to wed is denied by Ramona's foster mother, who reacts by exiling Alessandro from her ranch. He returns to his village, only to find that it has been demolished by white men. Meanwhile, Ramona is informed that she also has \"Indian blood\", which leads her to abandon everything she has to be with Alessandro.
