It consisted of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several [[adsorbent]]s such as [[diatomaceous earth]]. The product is infamous for its use by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[the Holocaust]] to murder approximately 1.1 <!-- NOTE: do NOT change \"approximately 1.1 million\" to \"millions of\" or somehow otherwise say or imply that Zyklon B was used to kill millions; other means were used. If you have a source that supports that millions rather than (about) a million were killed with Zyklon B and it somehow supersedes the sources used here, then please visit the talk page and present your sources.--> million people in [[gas chamber]]s installed at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Majdanek]], and other [[extermination camp]]s.\n\nHydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with [[cellular respiration]], was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s. Research at [[Degesch]] of Germany led to the development of Zyklon (later known as Zyklon A), a pesticide which released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|chemical weapon]]. [[Degussa]] purchased Degesch in 1922. Their team of chemists, which included {{illm|Walter Heerdt|de}} and [[Bruno Tesch (chemist)|Bruno Tesch]], devised a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and one of several [[adsorbent]]s such as [[diatomaceous earth]]. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included [[delousing]] clothing and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains.\n\nThe Nazis began using Zyklon B in extermination camps in early 1942 to murder prisoners during [[the Holocaust]]. Around 1.1 million people were killed using this method, mostly at Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the [[SS]] for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but it still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.\n\n==Mode of action==\n[[Hydrogen cyanide]] is a poisonous gas that interferes with [[cellular respiration]]. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) by binding to one of the [[protein]]s involved in the [[electron transport chain]].{{sfn|Nelson|Cox|2000|pp=668, 670\u201371, 676}} This protein, [[cytochrome c oxidase]], contains [[main subunit of cytochrome c oxidase|several subunits]] and has [[ligand]]s containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, [[heme]] a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand [[pi bond]]ing. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide [[Coordination complex|complex]], the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accepts them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP.{{sfn|Nelson|Cox|2000|pp=668, 670\u201371, 676}} Death occurs in a human being weighing {{convert|68|kg}} within two minutes of inhaling 70&nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide.{{sfn|International Cyanide Management Institute}}{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=273}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fumigating and Disinfecting Team New Orleans 1939 a019946 Crop.jpg|thumb| A fumigation team in New Orleans, 1939. Zyklon canisters are visible.]]\n\nHydrogen cyanide, discovered in the late 18th century, was used in the 1880s for the [[fumigation]] of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, [[goods wagon]]s, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=273}} Research by [[Fritz Haber]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4dlingsbek\u00e4mpfung mbH ([[Degesch]]), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=273\u2013274}} Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=274}}\n\nDeutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; [[Degussa]]) became sole owners of Degesch in 1922. There, beginning in 1922, {{illm|Walter Heerdt|de}}, [[Bruno Tesch (chemist)|Bruno Tesch]], and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant{{efn|Cautionary eye irritants used included [[chloropicrin]] and [[cyanogen chloride]].{{sfn|Christianson|2010|p=95}} }} and [[adsorbent]] stabilizers such as [[diatomaceous earth]]. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=274\u2013275}} Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application (number DE 438818) dated 20 June 1922. The [[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt]] awarded the patent on 27 December 1926.{{sfn|Heerdt|1926}} Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. Customs facilities along the Mexican border to fumigate the clothing of  border crossers.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}}\n\n==Corporate structure and marketing==\n\nIn 1930, Degussa ceded 42.5 percent ownership of Degesch to [[IG Farben]] and 15 percent to [[Th. Goldschmidt AG]], in exchange for the right to market pesticide products of those two companies through Degesch.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=278\u2013279}} Degussa retained managerial control.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=280}}\n\nWhile Degesch owned the rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the packaging system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=275}} Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 percent owned by Degussa, owned the rights to a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of [[sugar beet]] processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from [[Schering AG]] to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=275\u2013276}}{{sfn|Christianson|2010|p=165}} The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of [[Frankfurt]] and [[Tesch & Stabenow]] (Testa) of [[Hamburg]]. Their territory was split along the [[Elbe]] river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east.{{sfn|Christianson|2010|p=166}} Degesch owned 51 percent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 percent of Testa.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|loc=Chart, p.357}}\n\nPrior to World War II Degesch derived most of its Zyklon B profits from overseas sales, particularly in the United States, where it was produced under license by Roessler & Hasslacher prior to 1931 and by [[American Cyanamid]] from 1931 to 1943.{{sfn|Christianson|2010|pp=10, 92, 98}} From 1929, the [[United States Public Health Service]] used Zyklon B to fumigate freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants entering the United States.{{sfn|Christianson|2010|p=92}} Uses in Germany included [[delousing]] clothing (often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s) and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=281}} By 1943, sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 percent of Degesch's sales revenue and 70 percent of its gross profits.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=281}}\n\n==Use in the Holocaust==\n{{See also|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:GiftgasAuschwitzMuseum.jpg|thumb|upright|Empty Zyklon B canisters found by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] in 1945]]\nIn early 1942, the Nazis began using Zyklon B as the preferred killing tool in extermination camps during [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=281\u2013282}} They used it to kill roughly 1.1 million people in gas chambers at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Majdanek]], and elsewhere.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=2, 272}}{{sfn|PBS: Auschwitz}} Most of the victims were Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=161}}{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=272}}{{efn|Soviet officials initially stated that over 4 million people were killed using Zyklon B at Auschwitz, but this figure was proven to be greatly exaggerated.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=132\u2013133}} }} Distributor Heli supplied Zyklon B to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], and [[Buchenwald]], and Testa supplied it to Auschwitz and Majdanek; camps also occasionally bought it directly from the manufacturers.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=288\u2013289}} Some 56 tonnes of the 729 tonnes sold in Germany in 1942\u201344 were sold to concentration camps, amounting to about 8 percent of domestic sales.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=296}} Auschwitz received 23.8 tonnes, of which 6 tonnes were used for fumigation.

Crematorium II was originally designed as a mortuary with morgues in the basement and ground-level incinerators; they converted it into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas afterwards.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=100\u2013101}}{{efn|The gas chamber also had to be heated, as the Zyklon B pellets would not vaporize into hydrogen cyanide unless the temperature was {{convert|27|C}} or above.{{sfn|Pressac|Pelt|1994|p=209}} }} Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the beginning as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational.

It consisted of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several [[adsorbent]]s such as [[diatomaceous earth]]. The product is infamous for its use by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[the Holocaust]] to murder approximately 1.1 <!-- NOTE: do NOT change \"approximately 1.1 million\" to \"millions of\" or somehow otherwise say or imply that Zyklon B was used to kill millions; other means were used. If you have a source that supports that millions rather than (about) a million were killed with Zyklon B and it somehow supersedes the sources used here, then please visit the talk page and present your sources.--> million people in [[gas chamber]]s installed at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Majdanek]], and other [[extermination camp]]s.\n\nHydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with [[cellular respiration]], was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s. Research at [[Degesch]] of Germany led to the development of Zyklon (later known as Zyklon A), a pesticide which released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|chemical weapon]]. [[Degussa]] purchased Degesch in 1922. Their team of chemists, which included {{illm|Walter Heerdt|de}} and [[Bruno Tesch (chemist)|Bruno Tesch]], devised a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and one of several [[adsorbent]]s such as [[diatomaceous earth]]. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included [[delousing]] clothing and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains.\n\nThe Nazis began using Zyklon B in extermination camps in early 1942 to murder prisoners during [[the Holocaust]]. Around 1.1 million people were killed using this method, mostly at Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the [[SS]] for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but it still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.\n\n==Mode of action==\n[[Hydrogen cyanide]] is a poisonous gas that interferes with [[cellular respiration]]. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) by binding to one of the [[protein]]s involved in the [[electron transport chain]].{{sfn|Nelson|Cox|2000|pp=668, 670\u201371, 676}} This protein, [[cytochrome c oxidase]], contains [[main subunit of cytochrome c oxidase|several subunits]] and has [[ligand]]s containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, [[heme]] a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand [[pi bond]]ing. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide [[Coordination complex|complex]], the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accepts them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP.{{sfn|Nelson|Cox|2000|pp=668, 670\u201371, 676}} Death occurs in a human being weighing {{convert|68|kg}} within two minutes of inhaling 70&nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide.{{sfn|International Cyanide Management Institute}}{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=273}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fumigating and Disinfecting Team New Orleans 1939 a019946 Crop.jpg|thumb| A fumigation team in New Orleans, 1939.

Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, [[goods wagon]]s, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=273}} Research by [[Fritz Haber]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4dlingsbek\u00e4mpfung mbH ([[Degesch]]), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=273\u2013274}} Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=274}}\n\nDeutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; [[Degussa]]) became sole owners of Degesch in 1922.

This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from [[Schering AG]] to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=275\u2013276}}{{sfn|Christianson|2010|p=165}} The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of [[Frankfurt]] and [[Tesch & Stabenow]] (Testa) of [[Hamburg]].

They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=162}}\n\nA special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute delivered the Zyklon B to the crematoria by ambulance.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=162}} The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=170}} After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=170}} [[Johann Kremer]], an SS doctor who oversaw gassings, testified that the \"shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives\".{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=163}}\n\n''[[Sonderkommando]]s'' (special work crews forced to work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, artificial limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=171}} If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some foaming at the mouth or bleeding from their ears.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=170}} The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=171}} With the Soviet [[Red Army]] approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=174}} In November 1944, ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease throughout the Reich.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumb|Interior of Majdanek gas chamber, showing [[Prussian blue]] residue ]]\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, [[Bruno Tesch]] and [[Karl Weinbacher]] of Tesch & Stabenow were tried in a British military court and executed for knowingly providing Zyklon B to the SS for use on humans.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=972}} Gerhard Peters, who served as principal operating officer of Degesch and Heli and also held posts in the Nazi government, served two years eight months in prison as an accessory before being released due to amendments to the penal code.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|pp=297\u2013298}}\n\nUse of hydrogen cyanide as a pesticide or cleaner has been banned or restricted in some countries.{{sfn|United Nations|2002|pp=545, 171, 438}} Most hydrogen cyanide is used in industrial processes, made by companies in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the US.{{sfn|Dzombak et al.|2005|p=42}}{{sfn|United Nations|2002|p=545}} Degesch resumed production of Zyklon B after the war.

''Uragan'' means \"hurricane\" or \"cyclone\" in Czech.{{sfn|Lu\u010debn\u00ed z\u00e1vody Draslovka}}\n\nSubsequent use of the word \"Zyklon\" in trade names has prompted angry reactions in English-speaking countries. The name \"Zyklon\" on portable roller coasters made since 1965 by [[Pinfari]] provoked protests among Jewish groups in the U.S. in 1993,{{sfn|''New York Times''|1993}} and 1999.{{sfn|Katz|1999}} In 2002, British sportswear and football equipment supplier [[Umbro]] issued an apology and stopped using the name \"Zyklon\", which had appeared since 1999 on the box for one of its [[athletic shoe|trainers]], after receiving complaints from the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] and the [[Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre]].{{sfn|BBC News|August 2002}} Also in 2002, [[Siemens]] withdrew its application for an American trademark of the word \"Zyklon\", which their subsidiary [[BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausger\u00e4te]] had proposed to use for a new line of home appliances in the United States. (The firm was already using the name in Germany for one of their vacuum cleaners.) Protests were lodged by the Simon Wiesenthal Center after the trademark application was reported to [[BBC News Online]] by one of their readers.{{sfn|BBC News|September 2002}} French company IPC's product names used \"Cyclone\" for [[degreaser]]s and suffix \"B\" for [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]]: \"Cyclone B\" was renamed {{lang|fr|\"Cyclone Cap Vert\"}} (\"green cap\") in 2013 after protests from Jewish groups.{{sfn|Pi\u00e9rot|2013}}{{sfn|Ouest-France|2013}} A rabbi said the name was \"horrible ignorance at best, and a [[Guinness World Record|Guinness record]] in evil and cynicism if the company did know the history of the name of its product.\"{{sfn|The Jewish Press|2013}}\n\n[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] claim that Zyklon B gas was not used in the gas chambers, relying for evidence on the discredited research of [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who found low levels of [[Prussian blue]] in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's [[scientific control#Negative|negative control]], a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue.{{sfn|Harmon|Stein|1994}}  In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that had been exposed to the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount.{{sfn|''Mr. Death'': Transcript|1999}} In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in [[Krak\u00f3w]] re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction.{{sfn|Bailer-Gallanda|1991}} Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as [[scientific control#Positive|positive controls]]) and living quarters (as negative controls).

Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\"\n\nPrior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \"signed, sealed and delivered\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others.\n\n==Imprisonment==\n===Arrest===\nOn 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in

Shortly after passage, several groups attempted to have the courts rule the law unconstitutional, claiming it violated both [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights against unwarranted search and seizure, and [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights [[Due Process Clause|of due process]]. Several cases were combined before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz]]'', {{ussc|416|21|1974|el=np}}, which ruled that the Act did not violate the Constitution. Until the 1980s, there was a \"prolonged period of inaction\", but financial institutions eventually complied with the BSA's reporting requirements.<ref name=\"linn\"/>\n\nIt has been amended several times, including provisions in [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III|Title III]] of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which amended the BSA to require financial institutions to establish anti-money-laundering programs by establishing internal policies, procedures, and controls, designating compliance officers, providing ongoing employee training, and testing their programs through independent audits. There was an attempt to include another amendment in 2018, called the Illicit Arts and Antiquities Trafficking Prevention Act (IAATP). As the name implies, its aim was to restrict illegal trafficking of art in the United States which has the highest rates of money laundering in the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purkey |first1=Hannah |title=The Art of Money Laundering |journal=Florida Journal of International Law |date=April 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> It was not passed in the United States House of Representatives.

SAR reports, required when transactions indicate behavior designed to elude CTRs (or many other types of suspicious activities), include somewhat more detailed information and usually include investigation efforts on the part of the financial institution to assess the validity or nature of the transactions.  A single CTR filed for a client's account is usually of no concern to the authorities, while multiple CTRs from varying institutions or a SAR suggest that activity may be suspicious.\n\n===Suspicious activity report===\n{{main|Suspicious activity report}}\n\nA suspicious activity report (SAR) must report any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements by not filing CTR or  monetary instrument log (MIL), for example.  A SAR must also be filed if the customer's actions suggest that they are laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal laws and committing wire transfer fraud, check fraud, or mysterious disappearances.

Shortly after passage, several groups attempted to have the courts rule the law unconstitutional, claiming it violated both [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights against unwarranted search and seizure, and [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights [[Due Process Clause|of due process]]. Several cases were combined before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz]]'', {{ussc|416|21|1974|el=np}}, which ruled that the Act did not violate the Constitution. Until the 1980s, there was a \"prolonged period of inaction\", but financial institutions eventually complied with the BSA's reporting requirements.<ref name=\"linn\"/>\n\nIt has been amended several times, including provisions in [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III|Title III]] of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which amended the BSA to require financial institutions to establish anti-money-laundering programs by establishing internal policies, procedures, and controls, designating compliance officers, providing ongoing employee training, and testing their programs through independent audits. There was an attempt to include another amendment in 2018, called the Illicit Arts and Antiquities Trafficking Prevention Act (IAATP). As the name implies, its aim was to restrict illegal trafficking of art in the United States which has the highest rates of money laundering in the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purkey |first1=Hannah |title=The Art of Money Laundering |journal=Florida Journal of International Law |date=April, 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> It was not passed in the United States House of Representatives. This was because the aim of the IAATP did not directly correspond with the aim of the BSA which, according to Congressmen Luke Messer, sponsor of the bill, is to \u201ccounteract terrorist financing and crack down on terrorist organizations like ISIS.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nicyper |first1=Dean |last2=Lauren |first2=Bursey |title=How Anti-Money Laundering Legislation Could Impact the Art Market |url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-anti-money-laundering-legislation-impact-art-market |website=Artsy |publisher=Withers |accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> <ref name=\"linn\">{{cite journal|last1=Linn|first1=Courtney J.|title=Redefining the Bank Secrecy Act: Currency Reporting and the Crime of Structuring|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|date=2010|volume=50|issue=2|pages=407\u2013513|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=lawreview}}</ref>\n\n==Reports==\nBSA regulations require all financial institutions to submit five types of reports.

SAR reports, required when transactions indicate behavior designed to elude CTRs (or many other types of suspicious activities), include somewhat more detailed information and usually include investigation efforts on the part of the financial institution to assess the validity or nature of the transactions.

The story is set in the 9th-century Anglo-Saxon kingdoms [[Wessex]], [[Northumbria]] and [[Mercia]]. The first half of Season 3 of \"[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)]])\" is based on this novel.\n\nUhtred of Bebbanburg wins a victory against Norse raiders for King Alfred. Uhtred goes into exile from Wessex after killing a Christian priest, in reaction to the priest insulting his dead wife, Gisela. Uthred sets off viking, stays with Ragnar, then he returns to Mercia to serve [[Aethelflaed]], for whom he wins several victories.\n\nThis novel, and the series of which it is the fifth part, has been well received. One reviewer remarks \"Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield slaughter, rape, and destruction are artfully related by a masterful storyteller.\"<ref name=PW /> Another comments on the series and its viewpoint varying from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', saying \"Historical novels stand or fall on detail, and Mr Cornwell writes as if he has been to ninth-century Wessex and back.\"<ref name=Shipley /> Another again praises Cornwell's eye for historical detail, and \"his capacity for pulling off deft reverses are still in place, which helps to keep the narrative turning briskly along.\"<ref name=Edmonds />\n\n==Style and format==\n\nThe novel is written as a first-person narrative told by Uhtred as a reflection. The telling of the story is broken into three books titled \"The Warlord\", \"Viking\" and \"Battle's Edge\". The novel was also published with a family tree of Alfred the Great, a historical note, a list of Anglo-Saxon place names and their modern-day equivalent and a map depicting Anglo-Saxon Britain and the Southern coast of the English Channel and North Sea.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n'''892''' - '''893''': The second major campaign of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] against the invading Danes begins in earnest. Uhtred of Bebbanburg is now the preeminent warlord of Wessex, Alfred's kingdom. Alfred refers to him as \"my ''dux bellorum'', my lord of battles.\" Alfred urges him to swear to serve Alfred's son and presumed heir, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]]. \"Scour the enemy from England,\" Alfred says, \"and make my son safe on his God-given throne.\" Uhtred is unwilling to make that commitment. He has long wanted to return to his family's stronghold at Bebbanburg in Northumbria and to deal with his uncle Aelfric, who stole the family properties and titles from him. He wants his obligation to Alfred and Wessex to end when Alfred, now seriously ill, passes away.\n\nUhtred is military governor of Lundene (London), sharing power with Bishop Erkenwald, whom he dislikes but respects. At Alfred's behest, Uhtred delivers a message to the Danish ''Jarl'' (earl) Haesten, whose fleet threatens Wessex, that Alfred will pay a large ransom for Haesten to leave. Alfred cannot attack Haesten, because another Dane, Jarl Harald Bloodhair, has attacked at Cent (Kent). Haesten and Alfred reach an accord, and Haesten leaves hostages and accepts missionaries. Though he did not, Haesten's wife and family undergo baptism, which plainly amuses Haesten, like everything else. Uhtred knows that the hostages are fake and that if Harald defeats Alfred, Haesten will attack Wessex. While travelling with a small force to meet Alfred, Uhtred captures Skade, Harald's woman. Skade is a formidable fighter in her own right, and leads one of Harald's war parties. She and her party are captured while raiding a village in Eastern Wessex. Harald approaches Uhtred leading a line of Saxon captive women, and threatens to kill all of them if Skade is not returned to him. After he butchers one woman in front of her child, Uhtred releases Skade to him. Skade curses Uhtred as she and Harald make their escape.\n\nAt a meeting with Alfred and his advisors, Uhtred urges the king to adopt a plan to lure Harald to Farnham by sending a modest force there, and then attack Harald from the rear with most of Alfred's troops when he takes the bait. The plan works brilliantly. Uhtred and his men defeat Harald's forces and again take Skade prisoner. Harald is severely wounded, but escapes to Torneie Island (Thorney Island). There, with a few followers, he is able to use the island's natural defences and a palisade he builds to repel later attempts to defeat him. However, he is trapped there.\n\nWhile celebrating the Mercian/Saxon victory at Farnham, Uhtred is devastated by news that his beloved wife, Gisela, has died in childbirth, along with the child she bore. When Uhtred and Skade return to Lundene, Alfred's advisor, Bishop Asser uses the mad brother Godwin to denounce Gisela's name, ranting that Gisela was the devil's whore, and has come back from the dead as Skade. Uhtred flies into a rage and kills Godwin accidentally. Uhtred retreats to his house, where Uhtred's old friend and mentor, Father Beocca, tells him that Alfred has ordered Uhtred to pay a huge fine and swear an oath to Alfred's son Edward the Aethling. Alfred holds Uhtred's children as hostage to his terms, and places them in the custody of Aethelflaed, Alfred's daughter and wife of Aethelred, the ealdorman of Mercia. Furious, Uhtred reneges on his oath to Alfred and sails, with Skade, to Dunholm in Northumbria, stronghold of his old friend Ragnar, a Danish leader. Uhtred trusts Aethelflaed to protect his children.\n\nEager to use his newfound freedom and encouraged by Skade, Uhtred goes viking. He sails to [[Frisia]] to loot, kill and plunder Skirnir, Skade's husband, and on the journey, he and Skade become lovers. After he defeats and kills Skirnir, he is disappointed when Skirnir's treasure hoard fails to meet his expectations. When Skade demands half of the hoard as her share, Uhtred denies it to her. From that point on Skade becomes hostile to Uhtred. Uhtred winters at Ragnar's fortress at Dunholm.\n\nDuring that winter, Brida, Ragnar's wife, convinces Ragnar to attack Wessex alongside the other Northumbrian Jarls, Cnut and Sigrid. During the meeting, Haesten arrives and declares that he will attack Mercia. Haesten and Skade become infatuated with each other, and when Haesten leaves, Skade goes with him. Uhtred is caught in a conflict of loyalties, between the Danes with whom he was raised, and his oaths to Alfred and Aethelflaed. He also fears for his children's safety, as they are in Mercia, in Aethelflaed's custody. His indecision is broken when his friend, the Welshman Father Pyrlig arrives. Pyrlig reminds Uhtred that he has given his oath to serve Aethelflaed, and 'oaths made in love cannot be broken'. Uhtred serves Aethelflaed. He first has to rescue her from Lord Aldhem. Aethelred, Aethelflaed's husband, wishes to divorce her, to break free of Alfred's influence over Mercia. He directs Aldhem to have sex with Aethelflaed, either by seduction, or failing that, by force. Either act would make her an adulterer, allowing Aethelred to divorce her. Uhtred kills Aldhem, liberates Aethelflaed, and reunites with his children. He and Aethelflaed then go to Aethelred's council, surprising him before the assembled Mercian lords.\n\nWarning of Jarl Haesten's advance, Aethelflaed tries to win the Mercian lords to her side. She and Uhtred then wait at Lundene for support. Because Aethelred holds their purse-strings, none of the lords come, except for Lord Elfwold. Uhtred and Aethelflaed become lovers. Uhtred learns that Alfred had advised Aethelflaed to use Uhtred's oath to her to bring him back. Eventually, Edward Aethling arrives, along with Alfred's retainer and Uhtred's friend Steapa, and an army of twelve hundred of Alfred's best house troops. Uhtred again refuses to give his oath to Edward.\n\nThus reinforced, Uhtred marches ahead to Haesten's two forts at Baemfleot (Benfleet), although Haesten is not there. Uhtred encounters and attacks a larger Danish force and is surrounded. He nearly loses the battle and his life, but is saved and the battle won by the timely arrival of Steapa and the rest of Alfred's troops. They capture the first of the forts. Uhtred makes preparations for the next battle and begins teaching Edward how to lead from the front. Uhtred assaults the fort and scales the ditch, using sails with ropes sown into them to provide sure footing on the slippery ditch. He tries to use ladders to get up the wall, but the first assault fails. His second assault ultimately succeeds after Father Pyrlig throws specially prepared beehives onto the walls. The bees distract the defenders so that Uhtred's force can scale the walls and capture the fort.\n\nIn the hall Uhtred finds Skade and a hoard of gold. Harald Bloodhair, crippled and vengeful over Skade's betrayal with Haesten, suddenly appears, embraces Skade, and kills her at the same time. He then asks Uhtred to kill him. Uhtred does, then meets with Edward who says that he does not need Uhtred's oath as long as his sister has it. Uhtred and Aethelflaed then sail away from Baemfleot on the Thames.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Fictional===\n*'''Uhtred Ragnarson'''  the [[Protagonist]], narrator, dispossessed Ealdorman of [[Bebbanburg]]\n*'''Gisela''' \u2013 Uhtred's wife\n*'''Stiorra''' \u2013 Uhtred's daughter\n*'''Uhtred Uhtredson''' \u2013 Uhtred's son\n*''' Osbert ''' \u2013 Uhtred's youngest child\n*'''Steapa Snotor''' \u2013 A huge, fierce Saxon warrior, captain of Alfred's house troops\n*''' Father Willibald ''' \u2013 a British priest and friend of Uhtred\n*'''Father Pyrlig''' \u2013 A Welsh priest and warrior who is a close friend of Uhtred\n*'''Sihtric Kjartanson ''' \u2013 Kjartan's illegitimate son, sworn to Uhtred\n*'''Father Beocca ''' \u2013 Uhtred's friend and teacher\n*'''Osferth ''' \u2013 Alfred's illegitimate son, now a member of Uhtred's household troops\n*'''Ralla ''' \u2013 Uthred's shipmaster\n*'''Finan ''' (the Agile) \u2013 Irish ex-slave and captain of Uhtred's household troops\n*'''Rypere ''' \u2013 a Saxon, one of Uhtred's household troops and oath-men\n*'''Cerdic ''' \u2013 One of Uhtred's household troops and oath-men\n*''' Ragnar Ragnarson ''' \u2013 Jarl of Dunholm (Durham), blood-brother to Uhtred\n*''' Brida ''' \u2013 Ragnar's East Anglian wife\n*''' Rollo ''' \u2013 oath-man of Ragnar, fought with Uhtred in Frisia\n*''' Jarl Harald Bloodhair ''' \u2013 Danish earl, initially Skade's lover, enemy of Alfred and Uhtred\n*''' Skade ''' \u2013 Danish woman, wife of Skirnir, at various times Uhtred's lover and enemy\n*''' Offa ''' \u2013 A Saxon, formerly a priest, now ostensibly an entertainer with trained dogs, but in reality a purveyor of information.\n*''' Aelfric of Bebbanburg ''' \u2013 Uhtred's uncle, possessor of Bebbanburg, (Bamburgh Castle) Uhtred's hereditary home.\n*''' Skirnir ''' \u2013 Frisian chieftain and pirate, husband of Skade\n*''' Brother Godwin ''' \u2013 A blind monk, beholden to Bishop Asser.

This action-packed novel continues the saga of warfare for supremacy in Britain, a brutal period when Saxon and Danish swords, battleaxes, and treachery ruled the day. By now, Alfred the Great is old and feeble, unwilling and unable to repel the Danish invaders. He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred. Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield slaughter, rape, and destruction are artfully related by a masterful storyteller. Uhtred is victorious in some battles, but the outcome of others will have to wait for the sequel.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-088874-9 |title=The Burning Land |publisher=Publishers Weekly |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTom Shippey has strong praise in a detailed review of this novel, praise for the series, for this novel's portrayal of ninth-century Wessex, and for filling a gap in the written records, records written by Alfred's supporters.\n\n<blockquote>We have good historical sources for what happened next, notably an early life of Alfred written by Bishop Asser and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', annals compiled by anonymous scribes across two centuries. But both works were written by Alfred's supporters and intended to burnish his legend. \"The Burning Land\" opens accordingly with Uhtred as an old man, angrily burning what seems to be a copy of the \"Chronicle\" for the lies it tells. His own story is the true one, he insists. \"The Burning Land\" proceeds to tell it.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>What Mr Cornwell is doing\u2014it's often a good strategy for a historical novelist\u2014is writing into a gap in our knowledge. The Anglo-Saxons, for instance, thought they'd won a big battle at Farnham in 893, but the \"Chronicle\" is strangely silent on who was leading them. Why? We know that it wasn't Alfred, who was occupied elsewhere. Was the leader his son-in-law \u00c6thelred, Alfred's candidate for ruler (but not king) of Free Mercia? How did Alfred intend to realize his dream of assimilating Free Mercia, reconquering Danish Mercia, and rolling up the other kingdoms to create, for the first time ever, a political unit called \"England\"?</blockquote>. . .\n\n<blockquote>Historical novels stand or fall on detail, and Mr Cornwell writes as if he has been to ninth-century Wessex and back. He gives a graphic sense of what it's like to stand in a defensive shield-wall and how you go about breaking one. Each of his battles poses different tactical questions and gets imaginatively different answers. His accounts of fire and slaughter, and of Viking methods of extorting money, would seem gruesomely exaggerated if they weren't so often based on old legends or confirmed by archaeology.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In Uhtred, Mr Cornwell has given us a great character: quite a nice guy, underneath, but in a permanent bad temper as a result of disastrous, unrealistic and ungrateful higher management. Much has changed since the ninth century, but some things, and some feelings, are timeless.<ref name=Shipley>{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704586504574654820985883120  |title=A Saxon War Story: Imagining the battle for England as Vikings neared conquest |author=Shippey, Tom |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCurtis Edmonds is pleased with the development of Uhtred, the main character. While wishing Uhtred could stop being used by so many larger forces and instead follow his own desires, Edmonds knows that would be the end of The Saxon Tales, and there are more tales to tell. \"It\u2019s hard enough to write one novel, but it\u2019s downright difficult to pen five of them consecutively with the same characters and themes and keep the writing fresh and interesting. 'Difficult' isn't even the word; 'impossible' is more like it. &nbsp;... This is not to denigrate THE BURNING LAND in any way; it\u2019s superior entertainment (if you like your entertainment blood-stained and brutal). Uhtred is a fully-realized character, capable of great bravery and great foolishness, mixed in with\u2014as he might describe himself\u2014the deviousness of Loki and the thunder of Thor\u2019s hammer in battle. And Cornwell\u2019s eye for period detail and his capacity for pulling off deft reverses are still in place, which helps to keep the narrative turning briskly along.\"<ref name=Edmonds />\n\n\"The only thing to dislike about THE BURNING LAND is that it didn\u2019t go in the direction that the main character (and at least this part of the readership) wanted it to go. But that means that the issue of who holds Bebbanburg Castle will be resolved in another volume, and given Cornwell\u2019s talents, that will be a book to wait for indeed.\"<ref name=Edmonds>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/the-burning-land |title=Review: The Burning Land |author=Edmonds, Curtis |publisher=Bookreporter |accessdate=16 August 2014 |date=1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\nThis novel is the basis for the first half of season 3 of \"[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)]])\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bernard Cornwell}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burning Land}}\n[[Category:2009 British novels]]\n[[Category:The Saxon Stories]]\n[[Category:Novels by Bernard Cornwell]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox book| <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = The Burning Land\n| title_orig    = The Burning Land\n| image         = The Burning Land Cover.jpg\n| caption       = First edition cover\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Bernard Cornwell]]\n| country       = United Kingdom\n| language      = English\n| series        = [[The Saxon Stories]]\n| genre         = [[historical novel]]\n| publisher     = [[HarperCollins]]\n| release_date  = 2009\n| english_release_date =\n| media_type    = Print (hardback & paperback)\n| pages         = 366 first edition, hardback\n| isbn          = 978-0-00-721975-9\n| isbn_note     = (first edition, hardback)\n| preceded_by   = [[Sword Song (novel)|Sword Song]]\n| followed_by   = [[Death of Kings]]\n}}\n\n'''''The Burning Land''''' is the fifth [[historical novel]] in [[The Saxon Stories]] by [[Bernard Cornwell]], published in 2009.

Uhtred encounters and attacks a larger Danish force and is surrounded. He nearly loses the battle and his life, but is saved and the battle won by the timely arrival of Steapa and the rest of Alfred's troops. They capture the first of the forts. Uhtred makes preparations for the next battle and begins teaching Edward how to lead from the front. Uhtred assaults the fort and scales the ditch, using sails with ropes sown into them to provide sure footing on the slippery ditch. He tries to use ladders to get up the wall, but the first assault fails. His second assault ultimately succeeds after Father Pyrlig throws specially prepared beehives onto the walls. The bees distract the defenders so that Uhtred's force can scale the walls and capture the fort.\n\nIn the hall Uhtred finds Skade and a hoard of gold. Harald Bloodhair, crippled and vengeful over Skade's betrayal with Haesten, suddenly appears, embraces Skade, and kills her at the same time. He then asks Uhtred to kill him. Uhtred does, then meets with Edward who says that he does not need Uhtred's oath as long as his sister has it. Uhtred and Aethelflaed then sail away from Baemfleot on the Thames.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Fictional===\n*'''Uhtred Ragnarson'''  the [[Protagonist]], narrator, dispossessed Ealdorman of [[Bebbanburg]]\n*'''Gisela''' \u2013 Uhtred's wife\n*'''Stiorra''' \u2013 Uhtred's daughter\n*'''Uhtred Uhtredson''' \u2013 Uhtred's son\n*''' Osbert ''' \u2013 Uhtred's youngest child\n*'''Steapa Snotor''' \u2013 A huge, fierce Saxon warrior, captain of Alfred's house troops\n*''' Father Willibald ''' \u2013 a British priest and friend of Uhtred\n*'''Father Pyrlig''' \u2013 A Welsh priest and warrior who is a close friend of Uhtred\n*'''Sihtric Kjartanson ''' \u2013 Kjartan's illegitimate son, sworn to Uhtred\n*'''Father Beocca ''' \u2013 Uhtred's friend and teacher\n*'''Osferth ''' \u2013 Alfred's illegitimate son, now a member of Uhtred's household troops\n*'''Ralla ''' \u2013 Uthred's shipmaster\n*'''Finan ''' (the Agile) \u2013 Irish ex-slave and captain of Uhtred's household troops\n*'''Rypere ''' \u2013 a Saxon, one of Uhtred's household troops and oath-men\n*'''Cerdic ''' \u2013 One of Uhtred's household troops and oath-men\n*''' Ragnar Ragnarson ''' \u2013 Jarl of Dunholm (Durham), blood-brother to Uhtred\n*''' Brida ''' \u2013 Ragnar's East Anglian wife\n*''' Rollo ''' \u2013 oath-man of Ragnar, fought with Uhtred in Frisia\n*''' Jarl Harald Bloodhair ''' \u2013 Danish earl, initially Skade's lover, enemy of Alfred and Uhtred\n*''' Skade ''' \u2013 Danish woman, wife of Skirnir, at various times Uhtred's lover and enemy\n*''' Offa ''' \u2013 A Saxon, formerly a priest, now ostensibly an entertainer with trained dogs, but in reality a purveyor of information.\n*''' Aelfric of Bebbanburg ''' \u2013 Uhtred's uncle, possessor of Bebbanburg, (Bamburgh Castle) Uhtred's hereditary home.\n*''' Skirnir ''' \u2013 Frisian chieftain and pirate, husband of Skade\n*''' Brother Godwin ''' \u2013 A blind monk, beholden to Bishop Asser.

This action-packed novel continues the saga of warfare for supremacy in Britain, a brutal period when Saxon and Danish swords, battleaxes, and treachery ruled the day. By now, Alfred the Great is old and feeble, unwilling and unable to repel the Danish invaders. He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred. Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield slaughter, rape, and destruction are artfully related by a masterful storyteller. Uhtred is victorious in some battles, but the outcome of others will have to wait for the sequel.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-088874-9 |title=The Burning Land |publisher=Publishers Weekly |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTom Shippey has strong praise in a detailed review of this novel, praise for the series, for this novel's portrayal of ninth-century Wessex, and for filling a gap in the written records, records written by Alfred's supporters.\n\n<blockquote>We have good historical sources for what happened next, notably an early life of Alfred written by Bishop Asser and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', annals compiled by anonymous scribes across two centuries. But both works were written by Alfred's supporters and intended to burnish his legend. \"The Burning Land\" opens accordingly with Uhtred as an old man, angrily burning what seems to be a copy of the \"Chronicle\" for the lies it tells. His own story is the true one, he insists. \"The Burning Land\" proceeds to tell it.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>What Mr Cornwell is doing\u2014it's often a good strategy for a historical novelist\u2014is writing into a gap in our knowledge. The Anglo-Saxons, for instance, thought they'd won a big battle at Farnham in 893, but the \"Chronicle\" is strangely silent on who was leading them. Why? We know that it wasn't Alfred, who was occupied elsewhere. Was the leader his son-in-law \u00c6thelred, Alfred's candidate for ruler (but not king) of Free Mercia? How did Alfred intend to realize his dream of assimilating Free Mercia, reconquering Danish Mercia, and rolling up the other kingdoms to create, for the first time ever, a political unit called \"England\"?</blockquote>. . .\n\n<blockquote>Historical novels stand or fall on detail, and Mr Cornwell writes as if he has been to ninth-century Wessex and back. He gives a graphic sense of what it's like to stand in a defensive shield-wall and how you go about breaking one. Each of his battles poses different tactical questions and gets imaginatively different answers. His accounts of fire and slaughter, and of Viking methods of extorting money, would seem gruesomely exaggerated if they weren't so often based on old legends or confirmed by archaeology.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In Uhtred, Mr Cornwell has given us a great character: quite a nice guy, underneath, but in a permanent bad temper as a result of disastrous, unrealistic and ungrateful higher management. Much has changed since the ninth century, but some things, and some feelings, are timeless.<ref name=Shipley>{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704586504574654820985883120  |title=A Saxon War Story: Imagining the battle for England as Vikings neared conquest |author=Shippey, Tom |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCurtis Edmonds is pleased with the development of Uhtred, the main character. While wishing Uhtred could stop being used by so many larger forces and instead follow his own desires, Edmonds knows that would be the end of The Saxon Tales, and there are more tales to tell. \"It\u2019s hard enough to write one novel, but it\u2019s downright difficult to pen five of them consecutively with the same characters and themes and keep the writing fresh and interesting. 'Difficult' isn't even the word; 'impossible' is more like it. &nbsp;... This is not to denigrate THE BURNING LAND in any way; it\u2019s superior entertainment (if you like your entertainment blood-stained and brutal). Uhtred is a fully-realized character, capable of great bravery and great foolishness, mixed in with\u2014as he might describe himself\u2014the deviousness of Loki and the thunder of Thor\u2019s hammer in battle. And Cornwell\u2019s eye for period detail and his capacity for pulling off deft reverses are still in place, which helps to keep the narrative turning briskly along.\"<ref name=Edmonds />\n\n\"The only thing to dislike about THE BURNING LAND is that it didn\u2019t go in the direction that the main character (and at least this part of the readership) wanted it to go. But that means that the issue of who holds Bebbanburg Castle will be resolved in another volume, and given Cornwell\u2019s talents, that will be a book to wait for indeed.\"<ref name=Edmonds>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/the-burning-land |title=Review: The Burning Land |author=Edmonds, Curtis |publisher=Bookreporter |accessdate=16 August 2014 |date=1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\nThis novel is the basis for the first half of season 3 of \"[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)]])\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bernard Cornwell}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burning Land}}\n[[Category:2009 British novels]]\n[[Category:The Saxon Stories]]\n[[Category:Novels by Bernard Cornwell]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burning_Land"}

All Muslim citizens are still regarded as ''Turks'', or in turn [[Anatolian Turks]], by law, regardless of their ethnicity or language, in contrast to non-Muslim minorities, which are still grouped as \"non-Turks\"; the largest ethnic minority, the [[Kurds]], who are predominantly Muslim, are therefore still classified as simply \"Turks\".<ref name=Cagaptay/>{{sfn|Cagaptay|2014|p=70}}\n\nThe amount of ethnic minorities is suspected to be underestimated by the Turkish government. Therefore, the exact number of members of ethnic groups who are also predominantly Muslim is unknown; these include [[Arabs]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]], [[Chechens]], [[Kurds]] and [[Pontic Greeks]], among other smaller groups.\n\nMany of the minorities (including the Albanians, Bosniaks, Crimean Tatars, and various peoples from the Caucasus, as well as some of the Turks themselves) are descendants of Muslims (''[[Muhacir|muhajirs]]'') who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking [[Ottoman Empire]]. Majority of them assimilated into and intermarried with the majority Turkish population and have adopted the Turkish language and way of life, though do not necessarily identify as Turks.\n\nAlthough many minorities have no official recognition, state-run [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] television and radio broadcasts minority language programs and elementary schools offer minority language classes.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Tables ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:both\"\n|+ Distribution of nationalities in Anatolia<ref>{{cite book | last= Pentzopoulos | first = Dimitri | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece | publisher = C Hurst & Co | year=2002| url= https://books.google.com/?id=PDc-WW6YhqEC&pg=PA28&dq=%22northern+epirus%22%2Bflorence#v=onepage&q=%22northern%20epirus%22%2Bflorence&f=false | isbn= 978-1-85065-702-6 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Ottoman official statistics, 1910\n|-\n!

Beginning in the 1930s, the government instituted repressive policies forcing many Greeks to emigrate. Examples are the [[Labour battalion (Turkey)|labour battalion]]s drafted among non-Muslims during World War II as well as the Fortune Tax levied mostly on non-Muslims during the same period. These resulted in financial ruination and death for many Greeks. The exodus was given greater impetus with the Istanbul Pogrom of September 1955 which led to thousands of Greeks fleeing the city, eventually reducing the Christian Greek population to about 7,000 by 1978 and to about 2,500 by 2006 before beginning to increase again after 2008.\n\n=== Iranians ===\n{{Main article|Iranian diaspora}}\n[[Shireen Hunter]] noted in a 2010 publication that there were some 500,000 [[Iran]]ians in Turkey.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Shireen |authorlink=Shireen Hunter|title=Iran's Foreign Policy in the Post-Soviet Era: Resisting the New International Order |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO | page=160|isbn=9780313381942 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wLtA_J3VUt4C&pg=PA160#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Main article|Jews in Turkey}}\n{{Further information|Antisemitism in Turkey}}\n\nThere have been [[Romaniote Jews|Jewish communities in Asia Minor]] since at least the 5th century BC and many [[Sephardic Jews|Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain]] came to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century.

While [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] policy viewed all [[Muslims in Turkey]] as ''Turks'' without exception, non-Muslim minority group, such as Jews and Christians, were designated as \"foreign nations\", the aforementioned ''millet''.<ref name=Cagaptay/>{{sfn|Cagaptay|2014|p=70}} \n\n''Turk'' was also notably used to denote all groups in the region who had been [[Islamized]] during the Ottoman rule, especially Muslim [[Albanians]] and [[Slavic Muslims]].<ref name=\"BiaginiMotta2014\"/>\n\nThe 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]] specified [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] in general as [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] (''[[dhimmi]]''). This legal status was not granted to Muslim minorities, such as the [[Kurds]], which constituted the largest minority by a wide margin, nor any of the other minorities in the country.\n\nToday, in modern [[Turkey]], data on the ethnic makeup of the country is not officially collected, although various estimates exist. All Muslim citizens are still regarded as ''Turks'', or in turn [[Anatolian Turks]], by law, regardless of their ethnicity or language, in contrast to non-Muslim minorities, which are still grouped as \"non-Turks\"; the largest ethnic minority, the [[Kurds]], who are predominantly Muslim, are therefore still classified as simply \"Turks\".<ref name=Cagaptay/>{{sfn|Cagaptay|2014|p=70}}\n\nThe amount of ethnic minorities is suspected to be underestimated by the Turkish government. Therefore, the exact number of members of ethnic groups who are also predominantly Muslim is unknown; these include [[Arabs]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]], [[Chechens]], [[Kurds]] and [[Pontic Greeks]], among other smaller groups.\n\nMany of the minorities (including the Albanians, Bosniaks, Crimean Tatars, and various peoples from the Caucasus, as well as some of the Turks themselves) are descendants of Muslims (''[[Muhacir|muhajirs]]'') who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking [[Ottoman Empire]]. Majority of them assimilated into and intermarried with the majority Turkish population and have adopted the Turkish language and way of life, though do not necessarily identify as Turks.\n\nAlthough many minorities have no official recognition, state-run [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] television and radio broadcasts minority language programs and elementary schools offer minority language classes.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Tables ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:both\"\n|+ Distribution of nationalities in Anatolia<ref>{{cite book | last= Pentzopoulos | first = Dimitri | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece | publisher = C Hurst & Co | year=2002| url= https://books.google.com/?id=PDc-WW6YhqEC&pg=PA28&dq=%22northern+epirus%22%2Bflorence#v=onepage&q=%22northern%20epirus%22%2Bflorence&f=false | isbn= 978-1-85065-702-6 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Ottoman official statistics, 1910\n|-\n!

[[Greek Muslims|Muslim Greeks]] live in Turkey today. They live in cities of [[Trabzon]] and [[Rize]]. Pontic Greeks have [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry and speak the [[Pontic Greek]] dialect, a distinct form of the standard [[Greek language]] which, due to the remoteness of Pontus, has undergone [[Evolutionary linguistics|linguistic evolution]] distinct from that of the rest of the Greek world. The Pontic Greeks had a continuous presence in the region of Pontus (modern-day northeastern Turkey), Georgia, and [[Eastern Anatolia]] from at least 700 BC until 1922.\n\nSince 1924, the status of the Greek minority in Turkey has been ambiguous. Beginning in the 1930s, the government instituted repressive policies forcing many Greeks to emigrate. Examples are the [[Labour battalion (Turkey)|labour battalion]]s drafted among non-Muslims during World War II as well as the Fortune Tax levied mostly on non-Muslims during the same period. These resulted in financial ruination and death for many Greeks. The exodus was given greater impetus with the Istanbul Pogrom of September 1955 which led to thousands of Greeks fleeing the city, eventually reducing the Christian Greek population to about 7,000 by 1978 and to about 2,500 by 2006 before beginning to increase again after 2008.\n\n=== Iranians ===\n{{Main article|Iranian diaspora}}\n[[Shireen Hunter]] noted in a 2010 publication that there were some 500,000 [[Iran]]ians in Turkey.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Shireen |authorlink=Shireen Hunter|title=Iran's Foreign Policy in the Post-Soviet Era: Resisting the New International Order |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO | page=160|isbn=9780313381942 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wLtA_J3VUt4C&pg=PA160#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Main article|Jews in Turkey}}\n{{Further information|Antisemitism in Turkey}}\n\nThere have been [[Romaniote Jews|Jewish communities in Asia Minor]] since at least the 5th century BC and many [[Sephardic Jews|Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain]] came to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century.

She has two sons.\n\n==Early career==\nMargaret Nolan began her career in front of a camera lens as a model. As her glamour modelling career took off, she was briefly known as '''Vicky Kennedy''' in the early 1960s. Nolan reverted to her birth name as soon as acting roles beckoned; appearing in numerous television shows, theatre productions and films. The latter included ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' with [[the Beatles]], ''[[Ferry Cross the Mersey (film)|Ferry Cross the Mersey]]'' with [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] and [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]]'s ''[[Three Rooms in Manhattan]]''.\n\n==''Goldfinger''==\nIn 1964, Nolan played the small role of Dink, Bond's masseuse, in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634318/|title=Margaret Nolan|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> She was painted gold and wore a gold bikini for [[Robert Brownjohn]]'s title-sequence, advertisements and soundtrack-cover (not [[Shirley Eaton]] as in the narrative of the film). This led to photographs in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's ''James Bond's Girls'' edition of November 1965. In the 1971 film ''[[Carry On at Your Convenience]]'', composer Eric Rogers referenced Nolan's ''Goldfinger'' affiliation by using its three-note motif on a close-up of her. Nolan appeared on the front cover of both the US and UK versions of the 2005 book ''Robert Brownjohn: Sex and Typography''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signdesignsociety.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=103:robert-brownjohn-sex-and-typography-review&catid=7:book-reviews&Itemid=13|title=Sign Design Society - Home|website=Signdesignsociety.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Robert-Brownjohn-Typography-1925-1970-Life/dp/185669464X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359783751&sr=8-1|title=Sex & Typography: Robert Brownjohn: Sex and Typography|date=24 October 2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|accessdate=26 October 2018|via=Amazon}}</ref> The title-sequence was also parodied by the pop-band [[Scissor Sisters]] for their 2006 music-video ''Land of a Thousand Words''. In 2012, Nolan gave her first interview concerning her experiences as the model. Asked if the imagery liberates or celebrates womanhood, Nolan responded that <blockquote>It does celebrate the physical form. If I'd been nude it might have been about liberation because up to that point you wouldn't have seen a nude woman in a publicly visible thing like that. I could have been very pretentious and said this is liberating. But because I was dressed-up anyway I didn't get that sense.<ref>Playerist (2012:03) ''Margaret Nolan Interview'' Playerist No. 2</ref></blockquote> It became the first film-title to be shown in installation at [[MoMA]], New York (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/10/04/goldfinger-a-convergence-at-moma|title=MoMA - Goldfinger: A Convergence at MoMA|website=Moma.org|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nOn appearing in Michael Pertwee's 1969 farce ''She's Done It Again'' at London's [[Garrick Theatre]], Nolan was described as combining '...a long list of physical attractions with a talent that has contributed to the success of many films and television plays...'<ref>Flink, S (1969:13) ''Margaret Nolan'' Garrick Theatre Playbill Volume 4 No. 11</ref> She was known for five BBC series with [[Spike Milligan]] and in 2013 published a short essay on her time working with him. Nolan gave a live reading of the work at the [[Poetry Society]] in Covent Garden, reviewed by What's On London as a \"deeply-personal memoir... her performance simply magical.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whats-on-london.co.uk/review/poetry-cafe-playerist-comedy-night-review/|title=Poetry Caf\u00e9: Playerist Comedy Night \u2013 Review - What's on London|date=21 October 2013|website=Whats-on-london.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> She spoke of her awareness of Milligan's depressive character but also of their friendly working relationship; noting that \"Professionally, he taught me that timing is what makes things funny. Timing is crucial...\"<ref>Nolan, M (2013) ''Room at the Top'' Playerist No. 3, p. 16</ref> Nolan was given bigger roles in several 1970s [[Carry On films]] \u2013 and most sizably ''[[Carry On Girls]]''. The scene in ''Carry On Girls'' where a woman in a one-piece swim suit sneezes and bursts open two buttons on her outfit (revealing most of her breasts) is Nolan. The same film contains the sequence of Nolan (in a silver bikini) and [[Barbara Windsor]] cat-fighting on a hotel floor.\n\nNolan also appeared in serious theatre, motivated by political themes and in one of the first episodes of the television police drama ''[[The Sweeney]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretnolan.co.uk/3.html|title=about me|website=Margaretnolan.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> In 2011, Nolan's work as a comedy actress was recognised with her name included on Gordon Young's ''Comedy Carpet'' installation in front of [[Blackpool Tower]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comedycarpet.co.uk/comedians/|title=Comedy Carpet - Comedians|website=Comedycarpet.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> Also in 2011, Nolan returned to the screen after a gap of nearly three decades. She starred in a role especially written for her by Ann Cameron, in Yvonne Deutschman's ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588409/ The Power of Three]''. The film was set in Hampstead, and well-received on the independent circuit with a 7.2 rating on IMDb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588409/|title=The Power of Three|accessdate=26 October 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Art career==\nAs a visual artist, Nolan produces graphic and sometimes grotesque photo-montages assembled from cut-outs of her early publicity photographs. These pieces concern \"a unique and personal dialogue intrinsically related to a view of a woman and how a woman is viewed.\"<ref>Playerist (2012:02) ''Margaret Nolan Interview'' Playerist No. 2</ref>

She has two sons.\n\n==Early career==\nMargaret Nolan began her career in front of a camera lens as a model. As her glamour modelling career took off, she was briefly known as '''Vicky Kennedy''' in the early 1960s. Nolan reverted to her birth name as soon as acting roles beckoned; appearing in numerous television shows, theatre productions and films. The latter included ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' with [[the Beatles]], ''[[Ferry Cross the Mersey (film)|Ferry Cross the Mersey]]'' with [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] and [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]]'s ''[[Three Rooms in Manhattan]]''.\n\n==''Goldfinger''==\nIn 1964, Nolan played the small role of Dink, Bond's masseuse, in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634318/|title=Margaret Nolan|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> She was painted gold and wore a gold bikini for [[Robert Brownjohn]]'s title-sequence, advertisements and soundtrack-cover (not [[Shirley Eaton]] as in the narrative of the film). This led to photographs in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's ''James Bond's Girls'' edition of November 1965. In the 1971 film ''[[Carry On at Your Convenience]]'', composer Eric Rogers referenced Nolan's ''Goldfinger'' affiliation by using its three-note motif on a close-up of her. Nolan appeared on the front cover of both the US and UK versions of the 2005 book ''Robert Brownjohn: Sex and Typography''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signdesignsociety.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=103:robert-brownjohn-sex-and-typography-review&catid=7:book-reviews&Itemid=13|title=Sign Design Society - Home|website=Signdesignsociety.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Robert-Brownjohn-Typography-1925-1970-Life/dp/185669464X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359783751&sr=8-1|title=Sex & Typography: Robert Brownjohn: Sex and Typography|date=24 October 2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|accessdate=26 October 2018|via=Amazon}}</ref> The title-sequence was also parodied by the pop-band [[Scissor Sisters]] for their 2006 music-video ''Land of a Thousand Words''. In 2012, Nolan gave her first interview concerning her experiences as the model. Asked if the imagery liberates or celebrates womanhood, Nolan responded that <blockquote>It does celebrate the physical form. If I'd been nude it might have been about liberation because up to that point you wouldn't have seen a nude woman in a publicly visible thing like that. I could have been very pretentious and said this is liberating. But because I was dressed-up anyway I didn't get that sense.<ref>Playerist (2012:03) ''Margaret Nolan Interview'' Playerist No. 2</ref></blockquote> It became the first film-title to be shown in installation at [[MoMA]], New York (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/10/04/goldfinger-a-convergence-at-moma|title=MoMA - Goldfinger: A Convergence at MoMA|website=Moma.org|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nOn appearing in Michael Pertwee's 1969 farce ''She's Done It Again'' at London's [[Garrick Theatre]], Nolan was described as combining '...a long list of physical attractions with a talent that has contributed to the success of many films and television plays...'<ref>Flink, S (1969:13) ''Margaret Nolan'' Garrick Theatre Playbill Volume 4 No. 11</ref> She was known for five BBC series with [[Spike Milligan]] and in 2013 published a short essay on her time working with him. Nolan gave a live reading of the work at the [[Poetry Society]] in Covent Garden, reviewed by What's On London as a \"deeply-personal memoir... her performance simply magical.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whats-on-london.co.uk/review/poetry-cafe-playerist-comedy-night-review/|title=Poetry Caf\u00e9: Playerist Comedy Night \u2013 Review - What's on London|date=21 October 2013|website=Whats-on-london.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> She spoke of her awareness of Milligan's depressive character but also of their friendly working relationship; noting that \"Professionally, he taught me that timing is what makes things funny. Timing is crucial...\"<ref>Nolan, M (2013) ''Room at the Top'' Playerist No. 3, p. 16</ref> Nolan was given bigger roles in several 1970s [[Carry On films]] \u2013 and most sizably ''[[Carry On Girls]]''. The scene in ''Carry On Girls'' where a woman in a one-piece swim suit sneezes and bursts open two buttons on her outfit (revealing most of her breasts) is Nolan. The same film contains the sequence of Nolan (in a silver bikini) and [[Barbara Windsor]] cat-fighting on a hotel floor.\n\nNolan also appeared in serious theatre, motivated by political themes and in one of the first episodes of the television police drama ''[[The Sweeney]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretnolan.co.uk/3.html|title=about me|website=Margaretnolan.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> In 2011, Nolan's work as a comedy actress was recognised with her name included on Gordon Young's ''Comedy Carpet'' installation in front of [[Blackpool Tower]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comedycarpet.co.uk/comedians/|title=Comedy Carpet - Comedians|website=Comedycarpet.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> Also in 2011, Nolan returned to the screen after a gap of nearly three decades. She starred in a role especially written for her by Ann Cameron, in Yvonne Deutschman's ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588409/ The Power of Three]''. The film was set in Hampstead, and well-received on the independent circuit with a 7.2 rating on IMDb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588409/|title=The Power of Three|accessdate=26 October 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Art career==\nAs a visual artist, Nolan produces graphic and sometimes grotesque photo-montages assembled from cut-outs of her early publicity photographs. These pieces concern \"a unique and personal dialogue intrinsically related to a view of a woman and how a woman is viewed.\"<ref>Playerist (2012:02) ''Margaret Nolan Interview'' Playerist No. 2</ref> She has exhibited in London at venues including the Brick Lane Gallery (2009), The Misty Moon Gallery (2013) and Gallery Different (2013), whilst a screen-print is held by Kemistry Gallery.<ref>{{cite

''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130716165804/http://blankmediacollective.org/equalsproject/ equals: exploring feminism through art and conversation]'' at BLANKSPACE Manchester; the press release
