In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.<ref name=\"tuckerS\" />\nOn 14\u201315 February, Jordanian mortars hit several Israeli settlements in the [[Beit Shean Valley]] and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Israeli artillery and air forces retaliated against Jordanian bases and artillery batteries, as well as the American-financed East Ghor Canal (now known as the [[King Abdullah Canal]]).  As a result, thousands of Jordanian farmers fled eastwards, and fedayeen (agents willing to sacrifice themselves for the Palestinian cause) moved into the valley.  An American-sponsored ceasefire was arranged, and King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using Jordan as a base for attack.<ref name=\"morris367-368\">Morris (1999), pp. 367\u2013368</ref>\n\nIn February, King Hussein sent twenty carloads of troops and police to order a Fatah unit to leave the town of Karameh.

On the other hand, [[Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Abba Eban]] and his chief of bureau Gideon Rafael \u2014 mindful of an adverse American reaction due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US \u2014 worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel. [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Haim Bar-Lev]] promised a \"clean action\".

In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.<ref name=\"tuckerS\" />\nOn 14\u201315 February, Jordanian mortars hit several Israeli settlements in the [[Beit Shean Valley]] and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Israeli artillery and air forces retaliated against Jordanian bases and artillery batteries, as well as the American-financed East Ghor Canal (now known as the [[King Abdullah Canal]]).  As a result, thousands of Jordanian farmers fled eastwards, and fedayeen (agents willing to sacrifice themselves for the Palestinian cause) moved into the valley.  An American-sponsored ceasefire was arranged, and King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using Jordan as a base for attack.<ref name=\"morris367-368\">Morris (1999), pp. 367\u2013368</ref>\n\nIn February, King Hussein sent twenty carloads of troops and police to order a Fatah unit to leave the town of Karameh. When it arrived, the column found itself surrounded by men wielding machine guns; their commander said \"You have three minutes to decide whether you leave or die\". They withdrew.<ref name=brotherhood/> By March, several hundred civilians lived in the camp, along with about 900 guerrillas, mostly from Fatah, and PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]], who had his headquarters there.<ref name=\"morris368\">Morris (1999), p. 368</ref>\n\nIn Israel, Chief of the [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Military Intelligence Directorate]] [[Aharon Yariv]] stated that a raid would damage Fatah's prestige. On the other hand, [[Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Abba Eban]] and his chief of bureau Gideon Rafael \u2014 mindful of an adverse American reaction due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US \u2014 worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel. [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Haim Bar-Lev]] promised a \"clean action\". [[Israeli Defense Minister]] [[Moshe Dayan]] asked for a \"principal approval\" for a raid, but this was denied by the cabinet.

The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on [[Amman]], and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 [[Patton tank]]s and 88 artillery pieces.

People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns. However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful inspection of goods prior to purchase. In [[ancient Greece]], the [[agora]] served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods.<ref>Engen, Darel. \u201cThe Economy of Ancient Greece\u201d. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples, July 31, 2004. URL http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economy-of-ancient-greece/</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Rome]] utilized a similar marketplace known as the [[forum (Roman)|forum]]. Rome had two forums; the [[Roman forum|Forum Romanum]] and [[Trajan's Forum]]. [[Trajan's Market]] at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE,  was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with [[taberna]]e that served as retail shops, situated on four levels.<ref name=\"Coleman, P. 2006, p. 28\">Coleman, P., ''Shopping Environments,'' Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28</ref>  The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront.<ref name=\"Coleman, P. 2006, p. 28\"/>  In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Those who lived on the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating their need to attend local markets.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity,\" In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229</ref>\n\n[[Shopping list]]s are known to have been used by Romans.

Instead, they provided for their basic needs through subsistence farming practices and a system of localised personal exchanges.<ref>Schofield, J. and Vince, A.G., ''Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting,''A&C Black, 2003, p.151</ref> However, by the late Middle Ages, consumers turned to markets for the purchase of fresh produce, meat and fish and the periodic fairs where non-perishables and [[luxury goods]] could be obtained.<ref>Dye, C., ''Everyday Life in Medieval England,''  A & C Black, 2001, p.257</ref> Women were responsible for everyday household purchases, but most of their purchasing was of a mundane nature. For the main part, shopping was seen as a chore rather than a pleasure.<ref>By Jane Whittle, Elizabeth GriffithsConsumption and Gender in the Early Seventeenth-Century Household: The World of Alice Le Strange,'' Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 9- 11</ref>\n\nRelatively few permanent shops were to be found outside the most populous cities. Instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen.<ref>Thrupp, S.L., ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300\u20131500,'' pp. 7\u20138</ref> Itinerant vendors such as costermongers, hucksters and peddlers operated alongside markets, providing the convenience of home delivery to households, and especially to geographically isolated communities.<ref>Jones, P.T.A., \"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\" ''The London Journal'', Vol 41, No. 1, 2006, pp 64\u201365</ref>\n\nIn the more populous European cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Specialist retailers such as mercers and haberdashers were known to exist in London, while grocers sold \"miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines.\" However, these shops were primitive. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than \"rude booths.\" <ref>Knight, C., ''London,'' Vol. 5, 1841, Knight & Co, London, p. 132</ref>\n\nThe Medieval shopper's experience was very different from that of the contemporary shopper. Interiors were dark and shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Glazed windows in retail environments, were virtually unknown during the medieval period. Goods were rarely out on display; instead retailers kept the merchandise at the rear of the store and would only bring out items on request. The service counter was virtually unknown and instead, many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 155</ref>\n\nIn Britain, medieval attitudes to retailing and shopping were negative. Retailers were no better than hucksters, because they simply resold goods, by buying cheaper and selling dearer, without adding value of national accounts. Added to this were concerns about the self-interest of retailers and some of their more unethical practices. Attitudes to spending on luxury goods also attracted criticism, since it involved importing goods which did little to stimulate national accounts, and interfered with the growth of worthy local manufacturers.<ref>Cox, N., \"'Beggary of the Nation': Moral, Economic and Political Attitudes to the Retail Sector in the Early Modern Period\", in: John Benson and Laura Ugolini, ''A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing'', London,  I.B. Taurus, 2003, pp 25-51</ref>\n\n===Shopping for pleasure===\n\nThe modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or [[bourgeosie]] stimulated demand for luxury goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: Indian [[cotton]] and calico; silk, [[tea]] and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.<ref>Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992</ref> The act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; which changed the consumer's shopping experience.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129</ref> The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. [[English Restoration|Restoration]] London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like [[Nicholas Barbon]] and [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]].\n[[File:The Fable of the Bees (1705).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s work ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'', which justified conspicuous consumption.]]\nMuch pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying conspicuous consumption and private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s influential work ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.<ref>Peck, Linda, \"Consuming Splendor: Society and Culture in Seventeenth-Century England\", Cambridge Press, 2005; Gunor, B.,  \"A Research Regarding the Importance of Bernard Mandeville's Article: The Fable of Bees,\" ''Journal of Art and Language,\" Vol. 5, pp 521-536, 10.7816/idil-05-22-01</ref>\n\nThese trends gathered momentum in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as [[status symbol]]s, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The [[pottery]] inventor and [[entrepreneur]], [[Josiah Wedgewood]], pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|title=Coming to live in a consumer society|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810222240/http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-10}}</ref> One of his preferred sales techniques was to stage expansive showcases of wares in this private residences or in a rented hall, to which he invited the upper classes.<ref>McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.</ref>\n\nAs the 18th-century progressed, a wide variety of goods and manufactures were steadily made available for the urban middle and upper classes. This growth in consumption led to the rise of 'shopping' - a proliferation of retail shops selling particular goods and the acceptance of shopping as a cultural activity in its own right. Specific streets and districts became devoted to retail, including the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[Piccadilly]] in London.<ref name=\"BLibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/georgians/material/materialculture.html|title=Material Culture: Getting and Spending|publisher=British Library}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Arcade, Sydney, 1892 from Photographs of Sydney and New South Wales, ca.1892-1900 New South Wales Government Printer.jpg|thumb|Royal Arcade, Sydney, 1892]]\nThe rise of window shopping as a recreational activity accompanied the use of glass windows in retail shop-fronts. By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Britain, Europe and in the Antipodes in what became known as the \"arcade era.\" <ref>Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: D\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.</ref> Typically, these arcades had a roof constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Inside the arcade, individual stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,''ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nDesigned to attract the genteel middle class, retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos of daily street life; a place shoppers could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, promenading in these arcades became a popular pass-time for the emerging middle classes.<ref>Woodward, R.B., \"Making a Pilgrimage to Cathedrals of Commerce,\" ''New York Times,'' 11 March 2007, <Online: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/travel/11culture.html</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784, became one of the earliest examples of the new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, caf\u00e9s, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.<ref>Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140</ref>  In London, one of the first to use [[display window]]s in shops was retailer, [[Francis Place]], who experimented with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in [[Charing Cross]], where he fitted the shop-front with large plate glass windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he:\n:sold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&dq=Robertson%27s+Book+of+Firsts:+Who+Did+What+For+the+First+Time|title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time|author=Patrick Robertson\n|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9781608197385}}</ref>\n\nRetailers designed attractive shop fronts to entice patronage, using bright lights, advertisements and attractively arranged goods. The goods on offer were in a constant state of change, due to the frenetic change in [[fashion]]s. A foreign visitor commented that [[London]] was \"a world of gold and silver plate, then pearls and gems shedding their dazzling lustre, home manufactures of the most exquisite taste, an ocean of rings, watches, chains, bracelets, perfumes, ready-dresses, ribbons, lace, bonnets, and fruits from all the zones of the habitable world\".<ref name=\"BLibrary\" />\n[[File:Au Bon March\u00e9 (vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale - gravure).jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Le Bon March\u00e9]], founded in Paris, offered a wide variety of goods in \"departments\" inside one building, from 1851.]]\n\n===Evolution of stores: from arcades to department stores===\n\nIn the second half of the 19th-century, shops transitioned from 'single-function' shops selling one type of good, to the [[department store]] where a large variety of goods were sold. As economic growth, fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]] at the turn of the 19th-century, steadily expanded, the affluent bourgeois middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group was the catalyst for the emergence of the retail revolution of the period.\n\nThe term, \"department store,\" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops.<ref>Koot, G.M.,\"Shops and Shopping in Britain: from market stalls to chain stores,\" University of Dartmouth, 2011, <Online: https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/consumption/shopping.pdf></ref> A number of major department stores opened across the USA, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; [[Selfridges]] of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; [[Bloomingdale's]] in 1861; [[Sak's Fifth Avenue|Sak's]] in 1867; [[J.C. Penney]] in 1902; [[Le Bon March\u00e9]] of France in 1852 and [[Galeries Lafayette]] of France in 1905.\n\nThe first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co, which opened in 1796 on [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hibiscus-sinensis.com/regency/shoppingmalls.htm|title=Regency Shopping}}</ref> This venture was described as being a public retail establishment offering a wide range of [[consumer good]]s in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the [[business partnership]] was dissolved. Department stores were established on a large scale from the 1840s and 50s, in France, the United Kingdom and the US. French retailer, Le Bon Marche, is an example of a department store that has survived into current times  Originally founded in 1838 as a lace and haberdashery store, it was revamped mid-century and opened as a department store in 1852.<ref name=\"culture.gouv\">Jacques Marseille,\"Naissance des grands magasins: Le Bon March\u00e9,\"  Ministry of Culture of France, <Online: http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2002/bonmarche.htm  (in French)</ref>\n\nMany of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.<ref>Howard Moss, M., ''Shopping as an Entertainment Experience,'' Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35\u201339</ref>\n\n==Shopping venues==\n\n{{See|Retail#Retail format: types of retail outlet}}\n\n===Shopping hubs===\nA larger commercial [[zoning|zone]] can be found in many cities, more formally called a [[central business district]], but more commonly called \"[[downtown]]\" in the United States, or the \"high street\" in Britain, and [[souk]]s in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speaking areas. \n[[File:Window shopping in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Window shopping in Ottawa, 1938]]\n\nShopping hubs, or [[shopping center]]s, are collections of stores; that is a grouping of several [[business]]es in a compact geographic area. It consists of a collection of retail, entertainment and service stores designed to serve products and services to the surrounding region.\n\nTypical examples include [[shopping mall]]s, [[town square]]s, [[flea markets]] and [[bazaars]].\n\nTraditionally, shopping hubs were called [[bazaar]]s or [[marketplace]]s; an assortment of stalls lining streets selling a large variety of goods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bazaar|title=the definition of bazaar|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>.\n[[Image:ShoppingataMall.jpg|thumb|left|A woman shopping at a [[shopping mall]] in the [[United States]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe modern shopping centre is now different from its antecedents, the stores are commonly in individual buildings or compressed into one large structure (usually called ''Mall'' in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-shopping.html|title=shopping center Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about shopping center|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe first modern shopping mall in the US was The [[Country Club Plaza]] in Kansas City which opened in 1922, from there the first enclosed mall was designed by Victor [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-GruenVic.html Gruen] and opened in 1956 as [[Southdale Center|Southdale Centre]] in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. \n\nMalls peaked in America in the 1980s-1990s when many larger malls (more than 37,000 sq m in size) were built, attracting consumers from within a 32&nbsp;km radius with their luxurious department stores.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/shopping_center.aspx#1-1E1:shopping-full|title=shopping center Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about shopping center|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\nDifferent types of malls can be found around the world. ''[[Super-regional mall|Superregional malls]]'' are very large malls that contain at least five department stores and 300 shops. This type of mall attracts consumers from a broad radius (up to a 160-km). A ''regional mall'' can contain at least two department stores or \"[[anchor store]]s\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anchor+store|title=anchor store|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>. One of the biggest malls in the world is the one near [[Miami]], called \"Sawgrass Mills Mall\": it has 2,370,610 square feet (220,237 m2) of retail selling space, with over 329 retail outlets and name brand discounters.\n\nThe smaller malls are often called open-air strip centres or mini-marts and are typically attached to a grocery store or supermarket. \n\nThe smaller malls are less likely to include the same features of a large mall such as an indoor concourse, but are beginning to evolve to become enclosed to comply with all weather and customer preferences.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.com\"/>\n\n===Stores===\nStores are divided into multiple categories of stores which sell a selected set of goods or services. Usually they are tiered by target demographics based on the [[disposable income]] of the shopper. They can be tiered from cheap to pricey.\n\nSome shops sell secondhand goods. Often the public can also sell goods to such shops. In other cases, especially in the case of a [[nonprofit]] shop, the public donates goods to these shops, commonly known as [[thrift store]]s in the United States, [[charity shop]]s in the United Kingdom, or [[op shop]]s in Australia and New Zealand. In [[give-away shop]]s goods can be taken for free. In antique shops, the public can find goods that are older and harder to find. Sometimes people are broke and borrow money from a [[pawn shop]] using an item of value as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. College students are known to resell books back through college textbook [[bookstore]]s. Old used items are often distributed through [[surplus store]]s.\n\nVarious types of retail stores that specialize in the selling of goods related to a theme include [[bookstore]]s, [[boutique]]s, [[confectionery store|candy shop]]s, [[liquor store]]s, [[gift shop]]s, [[hardware store]]s, [[hobby store]]s, [[pet store]]s, [[pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[sex shop]]s and [[supermarket]]s.\n\nOther stores such as [[big-box store]]s, [[hypermarket]]s, [[convenience store]]s, department stores, [[general store]]s, [[dollar store]]s sell a wider variety of products not [[horizontal market|horizontally]] related to each other.\n\n====Home shopping====\n{{main|Home shopping}}\nHome [[mail delivery]] systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in combination with \n[[electronic commerce]], allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of home shopping: [[mail order|mail]] or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as [[periodicals]], TV and radio); and [[online shopping]]. [https://www.shoppingeverytime.com/ Online shopping] has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated, and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense, which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by 2020<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Forrester+Research+WebInfluenced+Retail+Sales+Forecast+2015+To+2020+US/-/E-RES129003|title=Forrester Research Web-Influenced Retail Sales Forecast, 2015 To 2020 (US)|website=www.forrester.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n====Neighborhood shopping====\nConvenience stores are common in North America, and are often called \"bodegas\" in Spanish-speaking communities or \"[[d\u00e9panneur]]s\" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes [[peddler]]s and [[ice cream truck]]s pass through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, [[garage sale]]s are a common form of [[second hand]] resale.\n\nNeighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and community services (like a [[library]]), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and services, location and popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boprc.govt.nz/media/90690/2c_successful-neighbourhood-shopping-centres.pdf|title=Successful neighbourhood shopping centres|last=Allan|first=Dr Abigail|date=2009|website=Opus Central Laboratories|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts, [[dairies]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacies]], [[Dry cleaning|Dry cleaners]], [[Hairdresser]]s/[[barber]]s, [[Liquor store|Bottle shops]], [[Coffeehouse|Caf\u00e9s]] and [[Take-out|take-away]] shops . Destination retailers include stores such as; [[Gift shop]]s, [[Antique shop]]s, Pet groomers, [[Engraving|Engravers]], [[Tattoo artist|Tattoo parlour]], [[Local bike shop|Bicycle shops]], Herbal dispensary clinics, [[Art museum|Art galleries]], Office Supplies and framers.  The neighbourhood retailers sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood retailers in different areas of a region or city, but destination retailers are often part of [[shopping mall]]s where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination retailers are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services.\n\n====Party shopping====\nThe [[party plan]] is a method of marketing products by hosting a social event, using the event to display and demonstrate the product or products to those gathered, and then to take orders for the products before the gathering ends.\n\n==Shopping activity==\n\n===Shopping seasons===\nShopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the United States, with [[Christmas shopping]] being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early as October and continuing until after Christmas.\n\nSome [[religion]]s regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice. Many contest the over-commercialization and the response by stores that downplay the shopping season often cited in the [[Christmas controversy|War on Christmas]].\n\nThe [[National Retail Federation]] (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school supplies for their children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/09/news/economy/July_retailsales/index.htm|title=Back-to-school sales' mixed grades|publisher=CNN|work=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=2008-01-27 | date=2007-08-09 | first=Parija B. | last=Kavilanz}}</ref> In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nrf.com/resources/consumer-research-and-data/holiday-spending/back-school-headquarters|title=Back-to-School Headquarters|last=|first=|date=2014-07-15|work=National Retail Federation|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSeasonal shopping consists of buying the appropriate [[clothing]] for the particular [[season]]. In winter people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around [[holiday]] sales and buying more for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends of the upcoming season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.finweb.com/financial-planning/shopping-for-clothes-in-the-off-season.html#axzz44F5YNuf0|title=Shopping for Clothes in the Off-Season - Financial Web|website=www.finweb.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%, with the biggest reduction sales occurring at the end of the season. Holiday shopping periods are extending their sales further and further with holidays such as [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] becoming a month-long event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes, as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/2014-holiday-shopper-research-shopping-never-sleeps.html|title=2014 Holiday Shopper Research: Shopping Never Sleeps|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> Today many people research their purchases online to find the cheapest and best deal with one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/2014-holiday-shopper-research-shopping-never-sleeps.html|title=2014 Holiday Shopper Research: Shopping Never Sleeps|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> Shoppers are now spending more time consulting different sources before making a final purchasing decision.

The first retailer to adopt fixed prices is thought to be the retailers operating out of the Palais-Royal complex in the 18th-century. These retailers adopted a system of high price maintenance in order to cultivate images of luxury. For their upper class clientele, fixed prices spared them from hassle of bartering.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nThe [[pricing]] technique used by most retailers is ''[[cost-plus pricing]]''. This involves adding a [[markup (business)|markup]] amount (or percentage) to the retailers' cost. Another common technique is ''[[suggested retail price|manufacturers suggested list]]'' pricing. This simply involves charging the amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the [[product (business)|product]] by the manufacturer.\n\nIn retail settings, ''[[psychological pricing]]'' or ''odd-number pricing'' are both widely used. [[Psychological pricing]] which refers to a range of tactics, designed to have a positive psychological impact. For example, price tags using the terminal digit \"9\" (e.g., 9.99, 19.99, or 199.99) can be used to signal [[price point]]s and bring an item in at just under the consumer's [[reservation price]].<ref>Poundstone, W., ''Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It),'' NY, Hill and Wang, 2011, pp. 184\u2013200</ref> However, in Chinese societies, prices are generally either a round number or sometimes some lucky number. This creates [[price points]].\n\nIn a fixed-price system, consumers may still use [[bargaining]] or ''haggling''; a [[negotiation]] about the price. Economists see this as determining how the transaction's total [[economic surplus]] will be divided between consumers and producers. Neither party has a clear advantage because the threat of no sale exists, in which case the surplus would vanish for both.\n\n[https://www.shoppingeverytime.com/the-advantages-of-online-shopping/ Advantages of online shopping] when [[online shopping|shopping online]], it can be more difficult to negotiate price given that you are not directly interacting with a [[sales|sales person]].

Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as  the recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper.

People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns. However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful inspection of goods prior to purchase. In [[ancient Greece]], the [[agora]] served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods.<ref>Engen, Darel. \u201cThe Economy of Ancient Greece\u201d.

Rome had two forums; the [[Roman forum|Forum Romanum]] and [[Trajan's Forum]]. [[Trajan's Market]] at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE,  was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with [[taberna]]e that served as retail shops, situated on four levels.<ref name=\"Coleman, P. 2006, p. 28\">Coleman, P., ''Shopping Environments,'' Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28</ref>  The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront.<ref name=\"Coleman, P. 2006, p. 28\"/>  In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Those who lived on the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating their need to attend local markets.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity,\" In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229</ref>\n\n[[Shopping list]]s are known to have been used by Romans.

Instead, they provided for their basic needs through subsistence farming practices and a system of localised personal exchanges.<ref>Schofield, J. and Vince, A.G., ''Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting,''A&C Black, 2003, p.151</ref> However, by the late Middle Ages, consumers turned to markets for the purchase of fresh produce, meat and fish and the periodic fairs where non-perishables and [[luxury goods]] could be obtained.<ref>Dye, C., ''Everyday Life in Medieval England,''  A & C Black, 2001, p.257</ref> Women were responsible for everyday household purchases, but most of their purchasing was of a mundane nature. For the main part, shopping was seen as a chore rather than a pleasure.<ref>By Jane Whittle, Elizabeth GriffithsConsumption and Gender in the Early Seventeenth-Century Household: The World of Alice Le Strange,'' Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 9- 11</ref>\n\nRelatively few permanent shops were to be found outside the most populous cities. Instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen.<ref>Thrupp, S.L., ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300\u20131500,'' pp. 7\u20138</ref> Itinerant vendors such as costermongers, hucksters and peddlers operated alongside markets, providing the convenience of home delivery to households, and especially to geographically isolated communities.<ref>Jones, P.T.A., \"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\" ''The London Journal'', Vol 41, No. 1, 2006, pp 64\u201365</ref>\n\nIn the more populous European cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Specialist retailers such as mercers and haberdashers were known to exist in London, while grocers sold \"miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines.\" However, these shops were primitive. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than \"rude booths.\" <ref>Knight, C., ''London,'' Vol. 5, 1841, Knight & Co, London, p. 132</ref>\n\nThe Medieval shopper's experience was very different from that of the contemporary shopper. Interiors were dark and shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Glazed windows in retail environments, were virtually unknown during the medieval period. Goods were rarely out on display; instead retailers kept the merchandise at the rear of the store and would only bring out items on request. The service counter was virtually unknown and instead, many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 155</ref>\n\nIn Britain, medieval attitudes to retailing and shopping were negative. Retailers were no better than hucksters, because they simply resold goods, by buying cheaper and selling dearer, without adding value of national accounts. Added to this were concerns about the self-interest of retailers and some of their more unethical practices. Attitudes to spending on luxury goods also attracted criticism, since it involved importing goods which did little to stimulate national accounts, and interfered with the growth of worthy local manufacturers.<ref>Cox, N., \"'Beggary of the Nation': Moral, Economic and Political Attitudes to the Retail Sector in the Early Modern Period\", in: John Benson and Laura Ugolini, ''A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing'', London,  I.B. Taurus, 2003, pp 25-51</ref>\n\n===Shopping for pleasure===\n\nThe modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or [[bourgeosie]] stimulated demand for luxury goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: Indian [[cotton]] and calico; silk, [[tea]] and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.<ref>Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992</ref> The act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; which changed the consumer's shopping experience.<ref>Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129</ref> The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. [[English Restoration|Restoration]] London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like [[Nicholas Barbon]] and [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]].\n[[File:The Fable of the Bees (1705).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s work ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'', which justified conspicuous consumption.]]\nMuch pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying conspicuous consumption and private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s influential work ''[[Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.<ref>Peck, Linda, \"Consuming Splendor: Society and Culture in Seventeenth-Century England\", Cambridge Press, 2005; Gunor, B.,  \"A Research Regarding the Importance of Bernard Mandeville's Article: The Fable of Bees,\" ''Journal of Art and Language,\" Vol. 5, pp 521-536, 10.7816/idil-05-22-01</ref>\n\nThese trends gathered momentum in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as [[status symbol]]s, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The [[pottery]] inventor and [[entrepreneur]], [[Josiah Wedgewood]], pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|title=Coming to live in a consumer society|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810222240/http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-10}}</ref> One of his preferred sales techniques was to stage expansive showcases of wares in this private residences or in a rented hall, to which he invited the upper classes.<ref>McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.</ref>\n\nAs the 18th-century progressed, a wide variety of goods and manufactures were steadily made available for the urban middle and upper classes. This growth in consumption led to the rise of 'shopping' - a proliferation of retail shops selling particular goods and the acceptance of shopping as a cultural activity in its own right. Specific streets and districts became devoted to retail, including the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[Piccadilly]] in London.<ref name=\"BLibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/georgians/material/materialculture.html|title=Material Culture: Getting and Spending|publisher=British Library}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Arcade, Sydney, 1892 from Photographs of Sydney and New South Wales, ca.1892-1900 New South Wales Government Printer.jpg|thumb|Royal Arcade, Sydney, 1892]]\nThe rise of window shopping as a recreational activity accompanied the use of glass windows in retail shop-fronts. By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Britain, Europe and in the Antipodes in what became known as the \"arcade era.\" <ref>Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: D\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.</ref> Typically, these arcades had a roof constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Inside the arcade, individual stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,''ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nDesigned to attract the genteel middle class, retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos of daily street life; a place shoppers could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, promenading in these arcades became a popular pass-time for the emerging middle classes.<ref>Woodward, R.B., \"Making a Pilgrimage to Cathedrals of Commerce,\" ''New York Times,'' 11 March 2007, <Online: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/travel/11culture.html</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784, became one of the earliest examples of the new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, caf\u00e9s, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.<ref>Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140</ref>  In London, one of the first to use [[display window]]s in shops was retailer, [[Francis Place]], who experimented with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in [[Charing Cross]], where he fitted the shop-front with large plate glass windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he:\n:sold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&dq=Robertson%27s+Book+of+Firsts:+Who+Did+What+For+the+First+Time|title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time|author=Patrick Robertson\n|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9781608197385}}</ref>\n\nRetailers designed attractive shop fronts to entice patronage, using bright lights, advertisements and attractively arranged goods. The goods on offer were in a constant state of change, due to the frenetic change in [[fashion]]s. A foreign visitor commented that [[London]] was \"a world of gold and silver plate, then pearls and gems shedding their dazzling lustre, home manufactures of the most exquisite taste, an ocean of rings, watches, chains, bracelets, perfumes, ready-dresses, ribbons, lace, bonnets, and fruits from all the zones of the habitable world\".<ref name=\"BLibrary\" />\n[[File:Au Bon March\u00e9 (vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale - gravure).jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Le Bon March\u00e9]], founded in Paris, offered a wide variety of goods in \"departments\" inside one building, from 1851.]]\n\n===Evolution of stores: from arcades to department stores===\n\nIn the second half of the 19th-century, shops transitioned from 'single-function' shops selling one type of good, to the [[department store]] where a large variety of goods were sold. As economic growth, fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]] at the turn of the 19th-century, steadily expanded, the affluent bourgeois middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group was the catalyst for the emergence of the retail revolution of the period.\n\nThe term, \"department store,\" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops.<ref>Koot, G.M.,\"Shops and Shopping in Britain: from market stalls to chain stores,\" University of Dartmouth, 2011, <Online: https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/consumption/shopping.pdf></ref> A number of major department stores opened across the USA, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; [[Selfridges]] of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; [[Bloomingdale's]] in 1861; [[Sak's Fifth Avenue|Sak's]] in 1867; [[J.C. Penney]] in 1902; [[Le Bon March\u00e9]] of France in 1852 and [[Galeries Lafayette]] of France in 1905.\n\nThe first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co, which opened in 1796 on [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hibiscus-sinensis.com/regency/shoppingmalls.htm|title=Regency Shopping}}</ref> This venture was described as being a public retail establishment offering a wide range of [[consumer good]]s in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the [[business partnership]] was dissolved. Department stores were established on a large scale from the 1840s and 50s, in France, the United Kingdom and the US. French retailer, Le Bon Marche, is an example of a department store that has survived into current times  Originally founded in 1838 as a lace and haberdashery store, it was revamped mid-century and opened as a department store in 1852.<ref name=\"culture.gouv\">Jacques Marseille,\"Naissance des grands magasins: Le Bon March\u00e9,\"  Ministry of Culture of France, <Online: http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2002/bonmarche.htm  (in French)</ref>\n\nMany of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.<ref>Howard Moss, M., ''Shopping as an Entertainment Experience,'' Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35\u201339</ref>\n\n==Shopping venues==\n\n{{See|Retail#Retail format: types of retail outlet}}\n\n===Shopping hubs===\nA larger commercial [[zoning|zone]] can be found in many cities, more formally called a [[central business district]], but more commonly called \"[[downtown]]\" in the United States, or the \"high street\" in Britain, and [[souk]]s in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speaking areas. \n[[File:Window shopping in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Window shopping in Ottawa, 1938]]\n\nShopping hubs, or [[shopping center]]s, are collections of stores; that is a grouping of several [[business]]es in a compact geographic area. It consists of a collection of retail, entertainment and service stores designed to serve products and services to the surrounding region.\n\nTypical examples include [[shopping mall]]s, [[town square]]s, [[flea markets]] and [[bazaars]].\n\nTraditionally, shopping hubs were called [[bazaar]]s or [[marketplace]]s; an assortment of stalls lining streets selling a large variety of goods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bazaar|title=the definition of bazaar|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>.\n[[Image:ShoppingataMall.jpg|thumb|left|A woman shopping at a [[shopping mall]] in the [[United States]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe modern shopping centre is now different from its antecedents, the stores are commonly in individual buildings or compressed into one large structure (usually called ''Mall'' in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-shopping.html|title=shopping center Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about shopping center|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe first modern shopping mall in the US was The [[Country Club Plaza]] in Kansas City which opened in 1922, from there the first enclosed mall was designed by Victor [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-GruenVic.html Gruen] and opened in 1956 as [[Southdale Center|Southdale Centre]] in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. \n\nMalls peaked in America in the 1980s-1990s when many larger malls (more than 37,000 sq m in size) were built, attracting consumers from within a 32&nbsp;km radius with their luxurious department stores.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/shopping_center.aspx#1-1E1:shopping-full|title=shopping center Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about shopping center|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\nDifferent types of malls can be found around the world. ''[[Super-regional mall|Superregional malls]]'' are very large malls that contain at least five department stores and 300 shops. This type of mall attracts consumers from a broad radius (up to a 160-km). A ''regional mall'' can contain at least two department stores or \"[[anchor store]]s\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anchor+store|title=anchor store|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>. One of the biggest malls in the world is the one near [[Miami]], called \"Sawgrass Mills Mall\": it has 2,370,610 square feet (220,237 m2) of retail selling space, with over 329 retail outlets and name brand discounters.\n\nThe smaller malls are often called open-air strip centres or mini-marts and are typically attached to a grocery store or supermarket. \n\nThe smaller malls are less likely to include the same features of a large mall such as an indoor concourse, but are beginning to evolve to become enclosed to comply with all weather and customer preferences.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.com\"/>\n\n===Stores===\nStores are divided into multiple categories of stores which sell a selected set of goods or services. Usually they are tiered by target demographics based on the [[disposable income]] of the shopper. They can be tiered from cheap to pricey.\n\nSome shops sell secondhand goods. Often the public can also sell goods to such shops. In other cases, especially in the case of a [[nonprofit]] shop, the public donates goods to these shops, commonly known as [[thrift store]]s in the United States, [[charity shop]]s in the United Kingdom, or [[op shop]]s in Australia and New Zealand. In [[give-away shop]]s goods can be taken for free. In antique shops, the public can find goods that are older and harder to find. Sometimes people are broke and borrow money from a [[pawn shop]] using an item of value as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. College students are known to resell books back through college textbook [[bookstore]]s. Old used items are often distributed through [[surplus store]]s.\n\nVarious types of retail stores that specialize in the selling of goods related to a theme include [[bookstore]]s, [[boutique]]s, [[confectionery store|candy shop]]s, [[liquor store]]s, [[gift shop]]s, [[hardware store]]s, [[hobby store]]s, [[pet store]]s, [[pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[sex shop]]s and [[supermarket]]s.\n\nOther stores such as [[big-box store]]s, [[hypermarket]]s, [[convenience store]]s, department stores, [[general store]]s, [[dollar store]]s sell a wider variety of products not [[horizontal market|horizontally]] related to each other.\n\n====Home shopping====\n{{main|Home shopping}}\nHome [[mail delivery]] systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in combination with \n[[electronic commerce]], allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of home shopping: [[mail order|mail]] or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as [[periodicals]], TV and radio); and [[online shopping]]. Online shopping has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated, and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense, which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by 2020<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Forrester+Research+WebInfluenced+Retail+Sales+Forecast+2015+To+2020+US/-/E-RES129003|title=Forrester Research Web-Influenced Retail Sales Forecast, 2015 To 2020 (US)|website=www.forrester.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n====Neighborhood shopping====\nConvenience stores are common in North America, and are often called \"bodegas\" in Spanish-speaking communities or \"[[d\u00e9panneur]]s\" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes [[peddler]]s and [[ice cream truck]]s pass through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, [[garage sale]]s are a common form of [[second hand]] resale.\n\nNeighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and community services (like a [[library]]), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and services, location and popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boprc.govt.nz/media/90690/2c_successful-neighbourhood-shopping-centres.pdf|title=Successful neighbourhood shopping centres|last=Allan|first=Dr Abigail|date=2009|website=Opus Central Laboratories|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts, [[dairies]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacies]], [[Dry cleaning|Dry cleaners]], [[Hairdresser]]s/[[barber]]s, [[Liquor store|Bottle shops]], [[Coffeehouse|Caf\u00e9s]] and [[Take-out|take-away]] shops . Destination retailers include stores such as; [[Gift shop]]s, [[Antique shop]]s, Pet groomers, [[Engraving|Engravers]], [[Tattoo artist|Tattoo parlour]], [[Local bike shop|Bicycle shops]], Herbal dispensary clinics, [[Art museum|Art galleries]], Office Supplies and framers.  The neighbourhood retailers sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood retailers in different areas of a region or city, but destination retailers are often part of [[shopping mall]]s where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination retailers are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services.\n\n====Party shopping====\nThe [[party plan]] is a method of marketing products by hosting a social event, using the event to display and demonstrate the product or products to those gathered, and then to take orders for the products before the gathering ends.\n\n==Shopping activity==\n\n===Shopping seasons===\nShopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the United States, with [[Christmas shopping]] being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early as October and continuing until after Christmas.\n\nSome [[religion]]s regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice. Many contest the over-commercialization and the response by stores that downplay the shopping season often cited in the [[Christmas controversy|War on Christmas]].\n\nThe [[National Retail Federation]] (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school supplies for their children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/09/news/economy/July_retailsales/index.htm|title=Back-to-school sales' mixed grades|publisher=CNN|work=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=2008-01-27 | date=2007-08-09 | first=Parija B. | last=Kavilanz}}</ref> In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nrf.com/resources/consumer-research-and-data/holiday-spending/back-school-headquarters|title=Back-to-School Headquarters|last=|first=|date=2014-07-15|work=National Retail Federation|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSeasonal shopping consists of buying the appropriate [[clothing]] for the particular [[season]]. In winter people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around [[holiday]] sales and buying more for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends of the upcoming season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.finweb.com/financial-planning/shopping-for-clothes-in-the-off-season.html#axzz44F5YNuf0|title=Shopping for Clothes in the Off-Season - Financial Web|website=www.finweb.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%, with the biggest reduction sales occurring at the end of the season. Holiday shopping periods are extending their sales further and further with holidays such as [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] becoming a month-long event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes, as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/2014-holiday-shopper-research-shopping-never-sleeps.html|title=2014 Holiday Shopper Research: Shopping Never Sleeps|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> Today many people research their purchases online to find the cheapest and best deal with one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/2014-holiday-shopper-research-shopping-never-sleeps.html|title=2014 Holiday Shopper Research: Shopping Never Sleeps|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref> Shoppers are now spending more time consulting different sources before making a final purchasing decision.

The first retailer to adopt fixed prices is thought to be the retailers operating out of the Palais-Royal complex in the 18th-century. These retailers adopted a system of high price maintenance in order to cultivate images of luxury. For their upper class clientele, fixed prices spared them from hassle of bartering.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nThe [[pricing]] technique used by most retailers is ''[[cost-plus pricing]]''. This involves adding a [[markup (business)|markup]] amount (or percentage) to the retailers' cost. Another common technique is ''[[suggested retail price|manufacturers suggested list]]'' pricing. This simply involves charging the amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the [[product (business)|product]] by the manufacturer.\n\nIn retail settings, ''[[psychological pricing]]'' or ''odd-number pricing'' are both widely used. [[Psychological pricing]] which refers to a range of tactics, designed to have a positive psychological impact. For example, price tags using the terminal digit \"9\" (e.g., 9.99, 19.99, or 199.99) can be used to signal [[price point]]s and bring an item in at just under the consumer's [[reservation price]].<ref>Poundstone, W., ''Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It),'' NY, Hill and Wang, 2011, pp. 184\u2013200</ref> However, in Chinese societies, prices are generally either a round number or sometimes some lucky number. This creates [[price points]].\n\nIn a fixed-price system, consumers may still use [[bargaining]] or ''haggling''; a [[negotiation]] about the price. Economists see this as determining how the transaction's total [[economic surplus]] will be divided between consumers and producers. Neither party has a clear advantage because the threat of no sale exists, in which case the surplus would vanish for both.\n\nWhen [[online shopping|shopping online]], it can be more difficult to negotiate price given that you are not directly interacting with a [[sales|sales person]]. Some consumers use [[price comparison service]]s to locate the best price and/or to make a decision about who or where to buy from to save money.\n\n===\"Window shopping\"===\n{{Main|Window shopping}}\n\n[[File:Window shopping in Cowbridge - geograph.org.uk - 1770681.jpg|alt=Women peer through a shop window on a rainy day|thumb|Window shopping in the rain]]\n\n\"Window shopping\" is a term referring to the browsing of goods by a consumer with or without the intent to purchase. Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as  the recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper. Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process, and recreational shoppers are those consumers who see the act of shopping as a form of enjoyment.<ref>Sproles, G.

The Rohe are grouped into 7 Rohe Mihana (Mission Districts), each led by a Missioner:\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Waikato)'''\n* Taupiri\n*Ngati Haua\n* Kirikiriroa\n* Puaha o Waikato / Tuakau\n*Taumarunui\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Waiariki)'''\n* Te Ngae\n* Ohinemutu\n* Tauponui-a-Tia\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Mataatua)'''\n* Whakatane\n*Kawerau\n*Ruatoki\n*Murupara\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Tauranga Moana)'''\n* Tauranga\n*Maketu\n*Pukehina\n* Te Puke\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Hauraki)'''\n*Parawai\n*Paeroa\n*Kennedy's Bay\n\n'''(Te Rohe Mihana o Te Kaha)'''\n\n*Opotiki\n*Torere\n*Te Kaha\n*Raukokore\n*Kauaetangohia\n\nMinistry also takes place in:\n* numerous prison, school and hospital chaplaincies\n* relational ministries including Kahui W\u0101hine (women's ministry), Kahui Tane (men's ministry), and Kahui Rangatahi (youth ministry)\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Hui Amorangi is governed by a hinota, a representative [[synod]] that meets annually. The Amorangi Whaiti executive meets several times a year, to discuss matters pertaining to the Hui Amorangi.\n\nThe Hui Amorangi comes under the [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal]] leadership of te P\u012bhopa o (the [[Bishop]] of) Te Manawa o Te Wheke, [[Ngarahu Katene]]. Katene was ordained (consecrated) as a bishop at [[Te Papa-i-o-uru Marae]], [[Rotorua]] on 14 October 2006.<ref name=\"lec19\" /> Katene is the first elected P\u012bhopa o Te Manawa o Te Wheke.\n\nSince 2017, [[David Moxon]] (archbishop emeritus) has served as He P\u012bhopa \u0100whina (an [[honorary assistant bishop]]).<ref name=\"lec19\">[http://anglican.org.nz/content/download/50400/254201/file/2019%20Lectionary%20.pdf ACANZP Lectionary, 2019] (pp. 145\u2013146)</ref>\n\nArchdeacon Ngira Simmonds is Te Manutaki | Director of Mission and Education.

They were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State (Rajkavis are similar to [[Poet laureate|poets laureate]]). Rai Moti Bhatt was the last Rajkavi of the Kuchesar State.\n\nThe rulers of Kuchesar built the fort in 1734 and maintained state population and awareness records. The fort was granted to Ramdhan Singh's family on a perpetual lease by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1790. This grant was confirmed by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1807. Ajit Singh's family acquired Kuchesar Fort during the 18th century when the [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] bestowed the Jat family with the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] (Rai Bahadur).\nThe fort served as the erstwhile seat of Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh. The fort is well-preserved and has been transformed into one of the most exotic heritage resorts in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Restoration and present-day operations==\nThe fort was restored and turned into a heritage-style hotel in 1994.

They were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State (Rajkavis are similar to [[Poet laureate|poets laureate]]). Rai Moti Bhatt was the last Rajkavi of the Kuchesar State.\n\nThe rulers of Kuchesar built the fort in 1734 and maintained state population and awareness records. The fort was granted to Ramdhan Singh's family on a perpetual lease by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1790. This grant was confirmed by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1807. Ajit Singh's family acquired Kuchesar Fort during the 18th century when the [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] bestowed the Jat family with the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] (Rai Bahadur).\nThe fort served as the erstwhile seat of Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh. The fort is well-preserved and has been transformed into one of the most exotic heritage resorts in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Restoration and present-day operations==\nThe fort was restored and turned into a heritage-style hotel in 1994.

The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

In March 1910, Wales suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Scotland when Roose allowed a speculative shot into the net having had his back turned towards play, talking to a spectator. In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911. A poor performance in a 2\u20132 draw with Scotland ultimately ended his international career as he was never selected for Wales again.<ref name=\"stead7679\"/>\n\nWales came within one match of winning a second title in 1912 and 1913, losing deciding matches against England on both occasions.<ref name=\"bhc1900\"/> In the [[1913\u201314 British Home Championship|final hosting of the championship]] before the First World War, Wales finished bottom of the table with one point. Robbins complained that English clubs had been \"antagonistic\" when asked to release players for international duty.

A goalless draw with England and a 2\u20131 victory over Ireland did secure the side the runners-up spot.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/> With club sides in Wales attracting record crowds, the national team often found itself losing out to the domestic game. The victory over Ireland was held on the same day that [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] hosted [[South Shields F.C.|South Shields]] in the [[Football League Second Division]], with only 11,000 attending the national side's match in Swansea while more than 30,000 attended Cardiff's fixture.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> Disappointing results between 1922 and 1923 prompted a revamp of the team for the [[1923\u201324 British Home Championship]]. One of the debutants in the team was [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town's]] [[Willie Davies (footballer)|Willie Davies]] who made an instant impact, scoring one of his side's goals during a 2\u20130 victory over Scotland in the opening game. Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal. A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; [[Fred Keenor]] scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref> Only a goalless draw with Ireland stopped Wales finishing last, only a year after winning the tournament.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/>\n\nSquad withdrawals proved a continued problem for the Welsh side. When Wales was left short for the visit of Scotland in the [[1925\u201326 British Home Championship|1925\u201326 Championship]], Ted Robbins called up debutant [[Jack Lewis (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lewis]] after following him to a train station in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City.<ref name=\"s105106\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a last minute interception for the final match against England.

The competition had started poorly for the side, conceding two goals in the first half against Scotland before [[Ernie Curtis]] and an own goal by [[Jimmy Gibson (footballer, born 1901)|Jimmy Gibson]] salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until [[Wilf Lewis]] secured the win for Wales, scoring the winning goal by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net.

The national side's poor results at the end of the 1920s were partly blamed on the deterioration of Welsh club sides. By the end of the decade, Cardiff City had been relegated to the Second Division, [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] had dropped out of the Football League and both [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] had survived re-elections to avoid the same fate.<ref name=\"s113114\"/>\n\n==Pre-war recovery==\n[[File:Fred Keenor, Brentford FC footballer, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Fred Keenor]], who captained the team of \"unknowns\" in 1930]]\nIn 1930, the Football League introduced a new ruling which prohibited its members from releasing players for international fixtures. The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland which was largely unaffected by the ruling as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience. As a result, the team was dubbed \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\".<ref name=\"BBCunknowns\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45425572 |title=Denmark v Wales: The story of the 1930s 'unknowns' who forced a draw in Scotland |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |last=Williams |first=Aled |date=7 September 2018 |accessdate=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324124029/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45425572 |archive-date=24 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"s116118\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=116\u2013118}}</ref> Ahead of the match, Keenor asked Ted Robbins if he could have the players to himself for four hours before the game.

The team fared little better, losing to England and Scotland before recording its only victory of the Euro 1968 qualifying campaign by beating Northern Ireland 2\u20130.<ref name=\"s192\"/>\n\nWales recorded a creditable 1\u20131 draw with [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] in April 1969 ahead of the qualifying campaign for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. However, the side was hampered by withdrawals and refusals to release players for matches. Wales' first match was against reigning European champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and Dave Bowen was forced to name several reserve players in the line-up, although the team only lost to a single goal by [[Luigi Riva]]. The side travelled to West Germany to play a return friendly against the side, with Bowen only able to select 13 players for the trip. Nevertheless, Wales recorded a second 1\u20131 draw; [[Barrie Jones]] had given Wales the lead before [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] equalised late in the match. The qualifying campaign for the 1970 World Cup ended with two defeats to East Germany and another to Italy as Wales failed to gain a single point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/70q.html |title=World Cup 1970 Qualifying |publisher=The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation. |last1=Stokkermans |first1=Karel |last2=Jarreta |first2=Sergio Henrique |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> Wales also finished bottom of the [[1968\u201369 British Home Championship|last British Home Championship of the decade]] with a single point.<ref name=\"bhc1967\"/>\n\nWales' struggles during the 1960s were blamed on several factors. The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book ''Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football'', Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\"<ref name=\"s195197\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=195\u2013197}}</ref> The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad. One player, Wrexham's teenage defender [[Gareth Davies (footballer, born 1949)|Gareth Davies]], was contacted in the early hours of the morning and travelled overnight to make the team's flight to [[Rome]].<ref name=\"s195197\"/> The organisation of the team by the FAW was also criticised. Goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]] later remarked that \"the international set-up with Wales at this time was amateurish at best\". Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager [[Don Revie]] in order to avoid selection with the national side.<ref name=\"s186187\"/> [[John Toshack]], who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles [...] some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\"<ref name=\"s186187\"/> An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when it failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the organisation's members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger [[Gil Reece]], would have to disembark. A furious Reece was left at the airport and had to travel alone to [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] before crossing the border into East Germany.<ref name=\"s195197\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/other-sport/welsh-greats-pay-tribute-gil-2458945 |title=Welsh greats pay tribute to Gil the Blade |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=23 December 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Departure of Bowen and arrival of Smith==\nWales began the 1970s in a more positive fashion, sharing the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship]] with England and Scotland.

Griffiths scored again in Wales' next two matches, a 2\u20130 win over Hungary and a 5\u20130 win over Luxembourg.
