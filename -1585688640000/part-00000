This type of attack is known as [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58775/hacking/cia-archimedes-tool.html|title=WikiLeaks leaked documents that detail the Archimedes tool used by the CIA in MitM attacks|last=Paganini|first=Pierluigi|date=2017-05-05|work=Security Affairs|access-date=2017-05-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 9 - \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\"===\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 9 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a [[malware]] installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a [[Windows service]] process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor Trojan]] behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.<ref name=\"Storm\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3196987/security/wikileaks-posts-user-guides-for-cia-malware-implants-assassin-and-aftermidnight.html|title=WikiLeaks posts user guides for CIA malware implants Assassin and AfterMidnight|last=Storm|first=Darlene|date=2017-05-15|work=[[Computerworld]]|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-wikileaks-dump-reveals-how-cia-hacks-spies-sabotages-software-1621980|title=New WikiLeaks dump reveals how the CIA hacks, spies and sabotages software|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2017-05-17|work=[[International Business Times|International Business Times UK]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 10 - \"Athena\"===\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 10 \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released [[Windows 10]] with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to [[Vault 7#Part 4|Grasshopper]] and [[Vault 7#Part 9|AfterMidnight]] malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a [[New Hampshire]] private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' [[Remote Access Service|Remote Access services]], while Hera hijacks Windows [[Microsoft DNS#DNS lookup client|Dnscache service]]. Also both Athena and Hera affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, [[Windows Server 2012]] and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] files to create a [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor]] to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive [[computer security software]]. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks has not provided any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-new-dump-reveals-all-windows-versions-can-be-targeted-by-cia-spy-malware-athena-1622508|title=What is WikiLeaks' new dump Athena?

This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for [[Server Message Block]] traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged.  The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cia-malware-can-switch-clean-files-with-malware-when-you-download-them-via-smb/|title=CIA Malware Can Switch Clean Files With Malware When You Download Them via SMB|work=BleepingComputer|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 12 - \"Cherry Blossom\"===\nOn 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 12 \"Cherry Blossom\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Cherry%20Blossom|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Cherry Blossom|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 13 - \"Brutal Kangaroo\"===\nOn 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 13 \"Brutal Kangaroo\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Brutal%20Kangaroo|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Brutal Kangaroo|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 14 - \"Elsa\"===\nOn 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 14 \"Elsa\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Elsa|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Elsa|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 15 - \"OutlawCountry\"===\nOn 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 15 \"OutlawCountry\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#OutlawCountry|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: OutlawCountry|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 16 - \"BothanSpy\"===\nOn 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 16 \"BothanSpy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#BothanSpy|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: BothanSpy|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 17 - \"Highrise\"===\nOn 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 17 \"Highrise\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Highrise|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Highrise|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 18 - \"UCL / Raytheon\"===\nUCL / Raytheon - 19 July 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#UCL%20/%20Raytheon|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: UCL / Raytheon|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 19 - \"Imperial\"===\nImperial - 27 July 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Imperial|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Imperial|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 20 - \"Dumbo\"===\nDumbo - 3 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Dumbo|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Dumbo|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 21 - \"CouchPotato\"===\nCouchPotato - 10 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#CouchPotato|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: CouchPotato|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 22 - \"ExpressLane\"=== \nWikiLeaks publishes secret documents from the \"ExpressLane\" project of the CIA. These documents show one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against liaison services\u2014which includes among many others the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nThe OTS (Office of Technical Services), a branch within the CIA, has a biometric collection system that is provided to liaison services around the world\u2014with the expectation for sharing of the biometric takes collected on the systems. But this 'voluntary sharing' obviously does not work or is considered insufficient by the CIA, because ExpressLane is a covert information collection tool that is used by the CIA to secretly exfiltrate data collections from such systems provided to liaison services.\n\nExpressLane is installed and run with the cover of upgrading the biometric software by OTS agents that visit the liaison sites. Liaison officers overseeing this procedure will remain unsuspicious, as the data exfiltration disguises behind a Windows installation splash screen.\n\nThe core components of the OTS system are based on products from Cross Match, a US company specializing in biometric software for law enforcement and the Intelligence Community. The company hit the headlines in 2011 when it was reported that the US military used a Cross Match product to identify Osama bin Laden during the assassination operation in Pakistan.- 24 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#ExpressLane|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: ExpressLane|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 23 - \"Angelfire\"===\nAngelfire - 31 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Angelfire|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Angelfire|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 24 - \"Protego\"===\nProtego - 7 September 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Protego|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Protego|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Authenticity ==\n{{quotebox|quote=[[Tucker Carlson]]: So, 51,000 people retweeted that.

Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing [[HTTPS]] interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public [[Domain name|domains]] through a masking interface known as \"Switchblade\".

Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware and coordinated their work in Joint Development Workshops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/security/77764-vault-7-guide-to-leak-data-from-samsung-tvs-released.html|title=iTWire - Vault 7: guide to leak data from Samsung TVs released|last=Varghese|first=Sam|date=2017-04-23|website=www.itwire.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Brandom |first=Russell |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421326/smart-tv-hacking-cia-samsung-weeping-angel-vulnerability |title=Here's how to use the CIA's 'weeping angel' smart TV hack |date=25 April 2017 |work=The Verge |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".<ref>{{Cite web| last = Pachal| first = Pete| title = CIA hack of Samsung TVs was named after a Doctor Who monster| work = Mashable| accessdate = 2017-03-08| url = http://mashable.com/2017/03/07/cia-samsung-tv-hack-weeping-angel/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last = Molina| first = Brett| title = Alleged CIA hack named after super creepy 'Doctor Who' villain| work = USA TODAY| accessdate = 2017-03-08| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/03/07/alleged-cia-technique-named-after-doctor-who-villain/98853924/}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 7 - \"Scribbles\"===\nOn 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 7 \"Scribbles\".

The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server.

According to U.S. [[SANS Institute]] instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security|ENISA]] member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect [[local area network]] (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58775/hacking/cia-archimedes-tool.html|title=WikiLeaks leaked documents that detail the Archimedes tool used by the CIA in MitM attacks|last=Paganini|first=Pierluigi|date=2017-05-05|work=Security Affairs|access-date=2017-05-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 9 - \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\"===\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 9 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a [[malware]] installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a [[Windows service]] process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor Trojan]] behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.<ref name=\"Storm\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3196987/security/wikileaks-posts-user-guides-for-cia-malware-implants-assassin-and-aftermidnight.html|title=WikiLeaks posts user guides for CIA malware implants Assassin and AfterMidnight|last=Storm|first=Darlene|date=2017-05-15|work=[[Computerworld]]|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-wikileaks-dump-reveals-how-cia-hacks-spies-sabotages-software-1621980|title=New WikiLeaks dump reveals how the CIA hacks, spies and sabotages software|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2017-05-17|work=[[International Business Times|International Business Times UK]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 10 - \"Athena\"===\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 10 \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released [[Windows 10]] with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to [[Vault 7#Part 4|Grasshopper]] and [[Vault 7#Part 9|AfterMidnight]] malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a [[New Hampshire]] private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' [[Remote Access Service|Remote Access services]], while Hera hijacks Windows [[Microsoft DNS#DNS lookup client|Dnscache service]]. Also both Athena and Hera affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, [[Windows Server 2012]] and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] files to create a [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor]] to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive [[computer security software]]. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks has not provided any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-new-dump-reveals-all-windows-versions-can-be-targeted-by-cia-spy-malware-athena-1622508|title=What is WikiLeaks' new dump Athena?

This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for [[Server Message Block]] traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware.

These documents show one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against liaison services\u2014which includes among many others the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nThe OTS (Office of Technical Services), a branch within the CIA, has a biometric collection system that is provided to liaison services around the world\u2014with the expectation for sharing of the biometric takes collected on the systems. But this 'voluntary sharing' obviously does not work or is considered insufficient by the CIA, because ExpressLane is a covert information collection tool that is used by the CIA to secretly exfiltrate data collections from such systems provided to liaison services.\n\nExpressLane is installed and run with the cover of upgrading the biometric software by OTS agents that visit the liaison sites. Liaison officers overseeing this procedure will remain unsuspicious, as the data exfiltration disguises behind a Windows installation splash screen.\n\nThe core components of the OTS system are based on products from Cross Match, a US company specializing in biometric software for law enforcement and the Intelligence Community. The company hit the headlines in 2011 when it was reported that the US military used a Cross Match product to identify Osama bin Laden during the assassination operation in Pakistan.- 24 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#ExpressLane|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: ExpressLane|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 23 - \"Angelfire\"===\nAngelfire - 31 August 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Angelfire|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Angelfire|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 24 - \"Protego\"===\nProtego - 7 September 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Protego|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects: Protego|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n== Authenticity ==\n{{quotebox|quote=[[Tucker Carlson]]: So, 51,000 people retweeted that.
