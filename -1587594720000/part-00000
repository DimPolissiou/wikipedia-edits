Lee Moffitt]], a [[Florida House of Representatives|Florida State Representative]], recognized the need for a comprehensive cancer center within the state after several friends died from cancer. An excellent negotiator, Moffitt put his plan into motion by first proposing the idea to Dr. Hollis Boren, then dean of the University of South Florida College of Medicine.  Over lunch at the Tampa Club, Moffitt proposed his idea.  By dessert, Boren has signed on. \"Out of that discussion came plans for a plug-shaped, multilevel cancer research teaching hospital to be built a short walk away from the USF clinics,\" ''The Tampa Times'' reported on February 5, 1979. Moffitt and Boren had gathered information about the need for a comprehensive cancer center, the article said, and the need was great.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Tampa Times|date=February 5, 1979 | title=Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://moffitt.org/about-us/our-story|website=Moffitt Cancer Center|title=About Us - Our Story|access-date=2014-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313164940/http://moffitt.org/about-us/our-story|archive-date=2014-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMoffitt sought community support and convinced the [[Florida Legislature|State Legislature]] to fund the facility. During the center's planning phase, consultants associated with [[NCI-designated Cancer Center]]s were retained to ensure that the finished facility would be as technologically advanced and as efficiently designed as possible.\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies took place in January 1983. The center was incorporated in the spring of 1984 and was named for H. Lee Moffitt, then Speaker of the State House of Representatives. The building was dedicated in October 1986 and admitted its first patients that same month.\n\nIn 1990, the acquisition of the Research Center building across from the Cancer Center enhanced the recruitment of scientists, clinicians, and support staff, and expanded Moffitt's vision beyond the original structure. The Moffitt Research Center became the focal point for basic and translational cancer research with the overriding goal to produce discoveries that could be translated quickly from the bench to the patient's bedside. The Florida Legislature allocated $12 million for renovation and equipment for this {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure, and the Moffitt Research Center became fully operational in 1995. In 1999, {{convert|48000|sqft|m2}} of basic research lab space was added to the Moffitt Research Center at a cost of $11 million to house the growing need for additional scientists.\n\n==Organization==\nOn June 10, 1998, in a ceremonial signing at Moffitt, [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Lawton Chiles]] approved a legislative initiative to fund construction of the Moffitt Tower Project, which opened in April 2003, adding more than {{convert|350000|sqft|m2}} of new space.  This expansion includes the Vincent A. Stabile Research Building, eponymously named in recognition of the largest private donation ever made to the Cancer Center.  The new construction also includes an expansion of the Moffitt Clinic. In addition to new research laboratories, which nearly double the cancer center's research capabilities, the new facilities include a digital imaging center, and a new infusion center.\n\nIn 1991, [[John Ruckdeschel]], M.D., assumed the position of Center Director, President and CEO.  Under Ruckdeschel's leadership, Moffitt became a [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Center]]. In 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://projectreporter.nih.gov/|title=Query Form - NIH RePORTER - NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results|website=projectreporter.nih.gov|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> the NCI renewed Moffitt's Cancer Center Support Grant for another five years. Currently Moffitt receives more than $50 million annually in peer-reviewed grant monies.\n\nIn 2002, Ruckdeschel stepped down, and William Dalton, Ph.D., M.D., became Moffitt's third President, CEO and Center Director.\n\nIn 2008, the [[University of Florida]] and [[Shands at the University of Florida|Shands at UF]] formed a partnership with Moffitt to develop programs in cancer care, research and prevention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moffitt.org/?spid=ED9E4710B2B043D09606227666D7B01C|title=Cancer Treatment & Research|website=Moffitt Cancer Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2008/01/23/moffitt-cancer-center/|title=UF announces partnership with Moffitt|publisher=|access-date=2008-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705130926/http://news.ufl.edu/2008/01/23/moffitt-cancer-center/|archive-date=2008-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/94950.php|title=Moffitt Cancer Center, Shands HealthCare, University Of Florida Partner To Improve Cancer Care|website=Medical News Today}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[University of South Florida]] and Moffitt were awarded $6 million in federal grant money to create the [[Center for Equal Health]], a five-year partnership focused on addressing issues of cancer [[health disparities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://centerforequalhealth.org/|title=\u5e74\u9f62\u3092\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u3054\u3068\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u306a\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u30d0\u30ec\u306a\u3044\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u79d8\u8a23 \u2013 \u5e74\u9f62\u3092\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u3054\u3068\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u306a\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u30d0\u30ec\u306a\u3044\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u79d8\u8a23\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2009/06/15/daily3.html USF, Moffitt get grant for minority health center]</ref>\n \nScientific programs include [[Molecular Oncology]], [[Drug Discovery]], [[Immunology]], Experimental [[Therapeutics]], Computational Biology of Cancer, Health Outcomes and Behavior and Risk Assessment, Detection and Intervention.

Over lunch at the Tampa Club, Moffitt proposed his idea.  By dessert, Boren has signed on. \"Out of that discussion came plans for a plug-shaped, multilevel cancer research teaching hospital to be built a short walk away from the USF clinics,\" ''The Tampa Times'' reported on February 5, 1979. Moffitt and Boren had gathered information about the need for a comprehensive cancer center, the article said, and the need was great.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Tampa Times|date=February 5, 1979 | title=Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://moffitt.org/about-us/our-story|website=Moffitt Cancer Center|title=About Us - Our Story|access-date=2014-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313164940/http://moffitt.org/about-us/our-story|archive-date=2014-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMoffitt sought community support and convinced the [[Florida Legislature|State Legislature]] to fund the facility. During the center's planning phase, consultants associated with [[NCI-designated Cancer Center]]s were retained to ensure that the finished facility would be as technologically advanced and as efficiently designed as possible.\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies took place in January 1983. The center was incorporated in the spring of 1984 and was named for H. Lee Moffitt, then Speaker of the State House of Representatives. The building was dedicated in October 1986 and admitted its first patients that same month.\n\nIn 1990, the acquisition of the Research Center building across from the Cancer Center enhanced the recruitment of scientists, clinicians, and support staff, and expanded Moffitt's vision beyond the original structure. The Moffitt Research Center became the focal point for basic and translational cancer research with the overriding goal to produce discoveries that could be translated quickly from the bench to the patient's bedside. The Florida Legislature allocated $12 million for renovation and equipment for this {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure, and the Moffitt Research Center became fully operational in 1995. In 1999, {{convert|48000|sqft|m2}} of basic research lab space was added to the Moffitt Research Center at a cost of $11 million to house the growing need for additional scientists.\n\n==Organization==\nOn June 10, 1998, in a ceremonial signing at Moffitt, [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Lawton Chiles]] approved a legislative initiative to fund construction of the Moffitt Tower Project, which opened in April 2003, adding more than {{convert|350000|sqft|m2}} of new space.  This expansion includes the Vincent A. Stabile Research Building, eponymously named in recognition of the largest private donation ever made to the Cancer Center.  The new construction also includes an expansion of the Moffitt Clinic. In addition to new research laboratories, which nearly double the cancer center's research capabilities, the new facilities include a digital imaging center, and a new infusion center.\n\nIn 1991, [[John Ruckdeschel]], M.D., assumed the position of Center Director, President and CEO.  Under Ruckdeschel's leadership, Moffitt became a [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Center]]. In 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://projectreporter.nih.gov/|title=Query Form - NIH RePORTER - NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results|website=projectreporter.nih.gov|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>, the NCI renewed Moffitt's Cancer Center Support Grant for another five years. Currently Moffitt receives more than $50 million annually in peer-reviewed grant monies.\n\nIn 2002, Ruckdeschel stepped down, and William Dalton, Ph.D., M.D., became Moffitt's third President, CEO and Center Director.\n\nIn 2008, the [[University of Florida]] and [[Shands at the University of Florida|Shands at UF]] formed a partnership with Moffitt to develop programs in cancer care, research and prevention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moffitt.org/?spid=ED9E4710B2B043D09606227666D7B01C|title=Cancer Treatment & Research|website=Moffitt Cancer Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2008/01/23/moffitt-cancer-center/|title=UF announces partnership with Moffitt|publisher=|access-date=2008-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705130926/http://news.ufl.edu/2008/01/23/moffitt-cancer-center/|archive-date=2008-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/94950.php|title=Moffitt Cancer Center, Shands HealthCare, University Of Florida Partner To Improve Cancer Care|website=Medical News Today}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[University of South Florida]] and Moffitt were awarded $6 million in federal grant money to create the [[Center for Equal Health]], a five-year partnership focused on addressing issues of cancer [[health disparities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://centerforequalhealth.org/|title=\u5e74\u9f62\u3092\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u3054\u3068\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u306a\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u30d0\u30ec\u306a\u3044\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u79d8\u8a23 \u2013 \u5e74\u9f62\u3092\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u3054\u3068\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u306a\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u30d0\u30ec\u306a\u3044\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u79d8\u8a23\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2009/06/15/daily3.html USF, Moffitt get grant for minority health center]</ref>\n \nScientific programs include [[Molecular Oncology]], [[Drug Discovery]], [[Immunology]], Experimental [[Therapeutics]], Computational Biology of Cancer, Health Outcomes and Behavior and Risk Assessment, Detection and Intervention.

This method of preparation can yield more delicately cooked eggs than cooking at higher temperatures such as with boiling water.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Poachedegg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A single broken poached egg on 2 pieces of [[toast]]]]\nThe egg is cracked into a cup or bowl of any size, and then gently slid into a pan of water at approximately 75\u00b0 C (167 \u00b0F) and cooked until the [[egg white]] has mostly solidified, but the [[yolk]] remains soft. The \"perfect\" poached egg has a runny yolk, with a hardening crust and no raw white remaining. In countries that mandate universal salmonella vaccination for hens, eating eggs with a runny yolk is perfectly safe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-41571327/runny-eggs-declared-safe-to-eat |title=Runny eggs declared 'safe to eat'}}</ref>\n\nBroken into water at the poaching temperature, the white will cling to the yolk, resulting in cooked [[egg white]] and runny yolk.\n\nAny given chicken egg contains some egg white that is prone to dispersing into the poaching liquid and cooking into an undesirable foam. To prevent this, the egg can be strained beforehand to remove the thinner component of the egg white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/03/how-to-poach-eggs-easy-way-poached-breakfast-video.html|title=How to Poach Eggs, the Foolproof Method (Really!)}}</ref>  A small amount of vinegar may also be added to the water, as its acidic qualities accelerate the poaching process.<ref>{{Cite web | title = everybody likes sandwiches: how to make the perfect poached egg | accessdate = 2009-08-02 | url = http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/ }}</ref> Stirring the water vigorously to create a [[vortex]] may also reduce dispersion.<ref>{{Cite web | title = how to poach an egg, smitten kitchen-style | publisher =smitten kitchen | accessdate = 2009-08-02 | url = http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/how-to-poach-an-egg-smitten-kitchen-style/ }}</ref>\n\n==Steamed==\n<!-- Section is target of redirect from [[Poached_egg_(steamed)]] -->\n\nThe term \"poaching\" is used for this method but is actually incorrect. The egg is placed in a cup and suspended over [[simmering]] water, using a special pan called an \"egg-poacher\". This is usually a wide-bottomed pan with an inner lid, with holes containing a number of circular cups that each hold one egg, with an additional lid over the top. To cook, the pan is filled with water and brought to a simmer, or a gentle boil.  The outer lid holds in the steam, ensuring that the heat surrounds the egg completely. The cups are often lubricated with butter in order to effect easy removal of the cooked egg, although non-stick egg poachers are also available.\n\nThe result is very similar to the traditional [[coddled egg]], although these steamed eggs are often cooked for longer, and hence are firmer.  Eggs so prepared are often served on buttered toast.\n\n==Dishes with poached eggs==\n\n[[File:Eggs Benedict.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Eggs Benedict]], a dish often served for breakfast or brunch.]]\n[[File:Suran.jpg|thumb|Garnished ''suran'' (poached egg)]]\n\nPoached eggs are used in the traditional [[Cuisine of the United States|American]] breakfast dish [[Eggs Benedict]].\n\nPoached eggs are the basis for many dishes in [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]], such as [[Eggs Sardou]], Eggs Portuguese, Eggs Hussarde and Eggs St. Charles.

This method of preparation can yield more delicately cooked eggs than cooking at higher temperatures such as with boiling water.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Poachedegg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A single broken poached egg on 2 pieces of [[toast]]]]\nThe egg is cracked into a cup or bowl of any size, and then gently slid into a pan of water at approximately 75\u00b0 C (167 \u00b0F) and cooked until the [[egg white]] has mostly solidified, but the [[yolk]] remains soft. The \"perfect\" poached egg has a runny yolk, with a hardening crust and no raw white remaining. In countries that mandate universal salmonella vaccination for hens, eating eggs with a runny yolk is perfectly safe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-41571327/runny-eggs-declared-safe-to-eat |title=Runny eggs declared 'safe to eat'}}</ref>\n\nBroken into water at the poaching temperature, the white will cling to the yolk, resulting in cooked [[egg white]] and runny yolk.\n\nAny given chicken egg contains some egg white that is prone to dispersing into the poaching liquid and cooking into an undesirable foam. To prevent this, the egg can be strained beforehand to remove the thinner component of the egg white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/03/how-to-poach-eggs-easy-way-poached-breakfast-video.html|title=How to Poach Eggs, the Foolproof Method (Really!)}}</ref>  A small amount of vinegar may also be added to the water, as its acidic qualities accelerate the poaching process.<ref>{{Cite web | title = everybody likes sandwiches: how to make the perfect poached egg | accessdate = 2009-08-02 | url = http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/ }}</ref> Stirring the water vigorously to create a [[vortex]] may also reduce dispersion.<ref>{{Cite web | title = how to poach an egg, smitten kitchen-style | publisher =smitten kitchen | accessdate = 2009-08-02 | url = http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/how-to-poach-an-egg-smitten-kitchen-style/ }}</ref>\n\n==Steamed==\n<!-- Section is target of redirect from [[Poached_egg_(steamed)]] -->\n\nThe term \"poaching\" is used for this method but is actually incorrect. The egg is placed in a cup and suspended over [[simmering]] water, using a special pan called an \"egg-poacher\". This is usually a wide-bottomed pan with an inner lid, with holes containing a number of circular cups that each hold one egg, with an additional lid over the top. To cook, the pan is filled with water and brought to a simmer, or a gentle boil.  The outer lid holds in the steam, ensuring that the heat surrounds the egg completely. The cups are often lubricated with butter in order to effect easy removal of the cooked egg, although non-stick egg poachers are also available.\n\nThe result is very similar to the traditional [[coddled egg]], although these steamed eggs are often cooked for longer, and hence are firmer.  Eggs so prepared are often served on buttered toast.\n\n==Dishes with poached eggs==\n\n[[File:Eggs Benedict.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Eggs Benedict]], a dish often served for breakfast or brunch.]]\n[[File:Suran.jpg|thumb|Garnished ''suran'' (poached egg)]]\n\nPoached eggs are used in the traditional [[Cuisine of the United States|American]] breakfast dish [[Eggs Benedict]].\n\nPoached eggs are the basis for many dishes in [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]], such as [[Eggs Sardou]], Eggs Portuguese, Eggs Hussarde and Eggs St. Charles.

He was one of six children of a dairyman who worked for Dick Hull, manager of the Irvindale Farms Dairy just outside [[Duluth, Georgia]]. Hull was married to Nora, daughter of General and Mrs. A.R. Glancy.\n\nDevastated by Olin's death, the Hulls began a community campaign to establish a clinic in Duluth, which had no physician. The townspeople, mostly cotton farmers, contributed $450 toward the clinic. Nora was so touched by their effort that she wrote a letter to her parents about the campaign.\n\nThe Glancys, who lived in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], knew the pain of losing a child. Only 17 years earlier, their youngest daughter, Joan, had died of pneumonia at age 4. Nora's letter touched their hearts, so they sent a check for $500, with the promise that every year, on Joan's birthday, they\u2019d send another check in her memory.  Heard Summerour, the town postmaster, inspired an [[wiktionary:epiphany|epiphany]] in the Glancys when he asked if they could name the new clinic The Joan Glancy Memorial Clinic. The Glancys realized that this little clinic\u2014in a hardscrabble hamlet in Georgia\u2014was the perfect way to create a living memorial to their daughter that would serve many families for years to come.  The Joan Glancy Memorial Clinic opened in 1941 in a three-room frame cottage on the school grounds. From the first day, the clinic was inundated with patients, so General Glancy issued a challenge to the people of Duluth: Provide land and a well, and he would build them a hospital.  In 1944, the Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital opened.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flanigan|first=James|title=History of Gwinnett County, Georgia, Volume 2|year=1943|publisher=Tyler & Co}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Bermudian, Volume 25|year=1954|publisher=University of Texas}}</ref>\n\n===Button Gwinnett Hospital===\nWhen county leaders established the Hospital Authority of Gwinnett County in 1957, the county's population had grown to about 30,000, but there were only 44 hospital beds available\u201427 at Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital and 17 at Hutchins Memorial Hospital, which opened in Buford in 1948. The newly chartered Authority devised a plan to build a hospital system consisting of three hospitals of 70 to 75 beds each and one large, central hospital with 200 beds. The Authority's first facility, Button Gwinnett Hospital, was constructed under a grant by the federal [[Hill-Burton Act]]. The hospital, which was located on the former county prison camp site on Scenic Highway in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]], began operations in 1959 with 35 beds and was expanded to 74 beds in 1966.\n\n===Buford General Hospital===\nIn 1966, Gwinnett Hospital System's capacity increased again with the completion of the 40-bed Buford General Hospital. Shortly after Buford General opened, Hutchins Memorial closed after 18 years of service.\n\n===Gwinnett Medical Center-Lawrenceville===\nWith a three-hospital system in place, the Hospital Authority watched as each facility quickly reached and exceeded capacity. The steady stream of new residents into [[Gwinnett County]] created a significant need for new hospital capacity. Expansion at all three hospitals was the only way to stay in line with the constantly increasing demand, so the Authority members set in motion a wave of renovation and expansion that continues today.\n\nBy early 1969, Authority members and hospital leaders made a strong push for the central hospital, but the plans were put on hold in the mid 1970s, when President [[Richard Nixon]] vetoed the [[Medical Construction and Modernization Act]], cutting off the federal hospital construction funding. When the funding resumed again in 1976, the Authority gave a unanimous go-ahead for construction of a $30 million, 250-bed central hospital in Gwinnett County.\n\nAfter several architectural designs and challenges with funding and site location, the reconfigured, 190-bed Gwinnett Medical Center (now Gwinnett Medical Center-Lawrenceville) opened in 1984, offering all general, medical, surgical and diagnostic services and 24-hour emergency room coverage. Button Gwinnett Hospital continued operation until the opening of the Gwinnett Medical Center in December 1984.\n\n===SummitRidge===\nIn 1983, Buford General was converted to an alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility. These services were transferred to the newly opened SummitRidge facility in 1993. SummitRidge, located in Lawrenceville, opened as a 76-bed behavioral health inpatient facility in the former building that housed Button Gwinnett Hospital. In 2008, SummitRidge was sold by Gwinnett Hospital System. SummitRidge continues to provide behavioral health inpatient services to Gwinnett and the surrounding communities under ownership unrelated to the Gwinnett Hospital System or the Hospital Authority of Gwinnett County.\n\n===Gwinnett Women's Pavilion===\nIn 1991, the Gwinnett Women's Pavilion was opened to provide maternity and newborn services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exploring the four types of women's centers |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution|date=March 17, 1992|page=B/4}}</ref>  It was the first hospital for women in the metro Atlanta area.<ref name=\"McKay\" /> The building houses a [[labor and delivery]] suite, mother/baby unit, high-risk pregnancy unit, and a [[NICU|Level III neonatal intensive care unit]].\n\n===Gwinnett Extended Care Center===\nIn 1997, the Gwinnett Extended Care Center (GECC) opened.<ref>{{cite news|title=Services bridge hospital-home gap |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution |date=June 25, 1997|page=J3}}</ref>  The GECC provides care for patients that are well enough to no longer need inpatient hospital care, but not well enough to return to independent living or traditional nursing home care.\n\n===Gwinnett Medical Center-Duluth===\n[[File:Gwinnett Medical Center - Duluth, June 2018.jpg|thumb|Gwinnett Medical Center - Duluth]]\nIn 2006, Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital's replacement facility opened as Gwinnett Medical Center-Duluth. The new 111-bed facility transferred most acute care and emergency services to the new location on Pleasant Hill Road within close proximity of the Joan Glancy property. The facility which formerly housed Joan Glancy Memorial Hospital continues to operate as a 30-bed inpatient physical rehabilitation program under the GMC-Duluth license with additional services that include diabetes & nutrition education and a sleep lab. This location has been renamed the Northside Gwinnett Joan Glancy Campus.\n\n==Famous patients==\n[[Larry Flynt]] was initially stabilized and treated at Button Gwinnett Hospital after he was shot in downtown Lawrenceville during a trial.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919451,00.html ''Time'' magazine- \"Nation: The Bloody Fall of a Hustler\"]</ref>\n\n==Movies==\nTwo Hollywood productions were filmed at Gwinnett Medical Center facilities.

A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006).

[[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n:==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n:==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n:==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n:==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "LEHarrison", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSpecific Types of Clock Damage", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}

Some patients would wait weeks for admission.<ref name=\"Charitable\" />\n\nEarly on, money was set aside for repairs to the old building and construction of a new ward, but it turned out not to be enough.
